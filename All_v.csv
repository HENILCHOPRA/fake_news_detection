2989,0,"Music director, singer and actor Himesh Reshammiya’s latest flick Tera Surroor, a sequel to his debut film Aap Ka Suroor released in theaters on Friday, to widespread chastisement. While movie-watchers and reviewers alike have been exhibiting no hesitation whatsoever in tearing the film apart, the final nail in the coffin was hammered by top Indian movie aficionado Arvind Kejriwal, who said that even he wouldn’t be watching and reviewing the movie.

Launching a scathing attack on the movie and its crew, the Delhi Chief Minister said, “You know that the Aam Aadmi Party stands for honesty and that I’ve severely punished whoever is immoral. As a new rule, whoever is found indulging in any corrupt activity will be forced to watch this movie. There can’t be a bigger deterrent to dishonesty than this. As the Chief Minister of India’s capital, I always live up to my responsibility of guiding my fellow citizens and countrymen to watching the best movies in town every Friday. But with due apologies to all of you, I have to say that even I, of all people, won’t be watching Tera Suroor. I have done nothing wrong so as to self-inflict this kind of punishment.”

The AAP chief went on to tear into PM Narendra Modi, placing the blame squarely on him. “Obviously, it is that coward and psychopath Modi who ruined this Gujarati talent. Look at him in the 90s and early 2000s – Himesh gave us such soulful and wonderful music. But after Modi became the CM, Himesh felt inspired to start singing and then acting and the rest is history. And you have Modi talking about skill development? Ha! Is this what he means by that? If so, then I sure as hell don’t want my skills to be developed by Modi. By the way, honestly speaking, as I always do, I admit I am a terrible singer. But you know what? Apart from The Ashutosh of course, many others have told me that even I sing better than Himesh. That is what Modi has achieved as Gujarat’s CM,” Kejriwal thundered.

Meanwhile, Modi supporters online hit right back at the Delhi CM, accusing him of double standards. “Kejriwal will not hesitate to watch secular Sajid Khan’s and his brother-in-law’s movies, no matter how ludicrous they are. But because Himesh is a Gujarati who flourished under Narendra bhai, he cries foul? #Hypocrisy #MinorityAppeasement #VotebankPolitics,” tweeted BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, following it up with a photoshopped pic of him watching the movie.

An emotional Reshammiya, however, broke down on hearing Kejriwal’s statement. “I don’t know why God is being so unkind to me. There are only 2 people in the world whom I expected to give favorable reviews to this movie – one is Taran Adarsh and the other is Arvindji. I’m not even counting myself in. Taran bhai has, of course, given 4.5 stars to the movie and hasn’t disappointed me. But I really wish Arvindji changes his mind to review my movie. That’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Please, Arvindji! Ooooooooooooooo,” wailed the music director with folded hands.",Arvind Kejriwal says even he won’t be reviewing Tera Surroor,3005,2.462562396

MUMBAI: Maharashtra is stuck in a peculiar state where the two pre-poll allies have enough numbers to form government, yet none of them has staked its claim. On the other hand, the BJP that fell short of six seats in Haryana cobbled up the numbers in a couple of days.The point of contention remains the distribution of key portfolios and sharing the Chief Minister's post, which the BJP has refused to part with. As Shiv Sena called off Tuesday's meeting with BJP General Secretary and close aide of Amit Shah Bhupendra Yadav, who was tasked to negotiate with the Sena, here are the ways Mission 145 can be achieved (Maharashtra Assembly has 288 seats).Let's start with the most improbable scenario. The BJP has bagged 105 seats on its own in the 288-member House. It needs 40 more seats to be able to form a government on its own, regardless of Sena. If the BJP is able to bag all 13 independents, which looks tough at the moment for BJP, the number goes up to 118. The saffron party would still need 27 seats. But all smaller parties, which includes the BJP's ideological adversary All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and CPI(M) - all put together are coming at 16. In that rarest of the rare situation where the BJP will have even Owaisi and Yechury backing BJP, the saffron party can't form the government on its own.Possibility: ImpossibleIf Scenario 1 was most improbable, this one is the most probable. Even on Tuesday night, BJP's Bhupendra Yadav and Chandarkant Dada Patil were slated to come on the negotiating table with Sena's Sanjay Raut and Subhash Desai, which now stands called off. The Sena and BJP are known to be warring partners who have done business with each other in spite of the Sena's mouthpiece targeting none less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Given its track record, and also the way the two sealed a deal after more than a month of negotiation before 2019 general election, Sena-BJP government is the most practical scenario where both together have 160 seats, 15 above the halfway mark. A BJP Union minister who has family relationship with Matoshree, the residence of Thackerays, insisted that he is hopeful Scenario 2 will emerge as the final scenario.Possibility: Most likelyThis sounds ideologically off track but politics, as they say, is an art of exploring improbabilities. With 54 seats of Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party and 44 seats of Indian National Congress giving outside support to a Shiv Sena government, for the first time ever a Thackeray can be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, a state where young Aditya's grandfather was known to be the kingmaker.Given the acrimonious relationship with the BJP, it easy for Congress to lend outside support to even Shiv Sena to keep BJP away. Congress MP Hussain Dalwai told IANS, ""We can think of supporting Sena, but it has to take the call first"".And the dragging of Pawar's name in the cooperative bank Scam just ahead of the state election that pumped in a new lease of life in the 79-year-old leader to fight the BJP also provides good enough reason to Sharad Pawar to lend outside support to an Aditya Thackeray-led government where BJP will sit in the opposition.Possibility: UnlikelyIn 2014, BJP ran a short minority government when Shiv Sena acted pricey. For days, Sena sat in the opposition side as Pawar's NCP provided a breather to Fadnavis-led BJP's minority government. Given the situation today, it's a deja vu for the state and the party. Also, given ED's allegations against Sharad and Ajit Pawar, an outside support to a minority BJP government can make things easy for the Pawar duo.So, what scenario will emerge as the final scenario? BJP's Mumbai Spokesperson Suresh Nakhua told IANS, ""There's a saying which goes like this: 'If you are with us, with you. If you are not with us, without you. If you are against us, in spite of you.' It will be BJP government and BJP CM, I can assure you. Rest is all are meaningless.""Possibility: Remote","As Shiv Sena calls off meeting, Maharashtra stares at four scenarios",4319,2.940495485

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

2994,0,"New Delhi. This act of carelessness can cost the Home Minister dearly if his careless attitude towards internal security didn’t cost him anything. P Chidambaram has misplaced the “clean chit” that Congress President and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi had given him yesterday during his 15-minutes meeting on the issue of Finance Ministry note by Pranab Mukherjee, which appeared to implicate him in the 2G spectrum allocation scam.

“Look beneath the sofa; it’s white in color,” Chidambaram was seen hurriedly and worriedly ordering his housekeeping staff, who searched every nook and corner of his official residence to find the now missing “clean chit”.

Chidambaram in a jolly mood last night

“Sir was in very good mood last night when he came back home; he was singing Benny Lava song flashing a piece of paper in his hand,” Gangubai, the senior most member of the housekeeping staff described the scenes of the last evening when Chidambaram came back home after meeting Sonia Gandhi.

“He switched on the television where news channels were discussing what could have transpired in the meetings,” Gangubai further recalled, “He was smiling and suddenly he burst into laughter, waving his piece of paper towards the television screen, yelling – this, this, you biatches!”

Chidambaram reportedly turned off the television when he saw a small report on death of Rajbala, a Baba Ramdev follower who was injured during Ramlila Maidan crackdown in June early this year.

“Good lord, the news has been lost in the whole speculation over 2G note and meetings; perhaps Pranabda is not so bad,” he is alleged to have muttered to himself before going to have a peaceful and sound sleep.

This morning, when he was supposed to hand out the “clean chit” to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is returning to India after speaking at UN, Chidambaram found to his horror that the chit was missing. He frantically searched everywhere but couldn’t find the prized possession.

“He even called up Subramanian Swamy and asked if he had broken into his house last night,” a close aide of Chidambaram told Faking News, “Swamy is reported to have denied the allegations and asked Chidambaram to check if his house was bugged like Pranab Mukherjee’s office.”

“Swamy seemed to suggest that there was someone who was keeping an eye over both Chidambaram and Pranab, and manipulating them to his or her own advantage,” Chidambaram’s aide explained.

Not interested in pondering over conspiracy theories, the Home Minister is reported to have tried calling up everyone, including Digvijay Singh, to get help on the missing “clean chit”, but of no help.

Experts believe that Chidambaram could be in deep trouble if he fails to find the missing chit before Manmohan Singh returns back to India later tonight.

“He better finds it by tomorrow morning and hands it over to the Prime Minister, who will then hand it over to the CBI,” an expert said.",Chidambaram misplaces “clean chit” Sonia Gandhi gave him,2923,1.573725624

Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, MSD, sporting a Mohawk hair do, was his usual forthright self. Here are some excerpts:-

Question: First off, on a personal note MS, how is the baby?

MSD: Well, he is a new face on the scene and I thought he did pretty well, whenever he got the chance, but let’s wait and see. Sorry? Oh, you meant my baby. I thought you were talking about this chap, Sachin Baby who plays for RCB. Ha ha! Well my baby is doing fine though she is having some teething problems, but Sakshi will soon sort that out.

Q: Back to the tour, Graeme Cremer thinks it will be a tough series. Any comment?

MSD: Graham Who? Sorry, didn’t quite catch the name.

Q: Graeme Cremer. Captain of Zimbabwe. He expects a tough series.

MSD: Never heard of him, but I agree with him that it will be a tough series. Certainly for Zimbabwe. (Turns to the manager and asks for the Zimbabwe team list).

Q: MS, you are also without so many key players. No Virat, Ashwin, Jinks, Suresh etc. How will you cope?

MS: Look, I didn’t want any of those guys in the team in the first place. Against Zimbabwe, with Virat and company, I wouldn’t have got a chance to face a single ball. Unless I opened the batting. Then I would have had to listen to Ravi Bhai rooting for Virat as the captain. Not to mention that odious Boria character, who wants Saurav reinstated as the skipper. Oh, hi Boria, didn’t see you hiding behind that wide pillar. Bhalo aachhen? Ok, next?

Q: I am Django Kookkaburra from the Harare Tribune. Can you tell us MS, your assessment of this new look Zimbabwe team?

MS: Look Kooky. May I call you Kooky? Easier all round. Thanks. Any team from Zimbabwe is new to me. I only knew Duncan Fletcher, and it was impossible to get a word out of him. Anyway from the team list in front of me, I see that you have two Mazakadzas and a Chibhabha, which is tough enough on the Indian commentary team. Mutumbami, Muzarabani and Jongwe won’t help matters either. Next question? Ah, Boria. I can see you straining at the leash. Ravi Bhai taught me that expression.

Q: And he taught you well, MS. But since it is unlikely you will skipper India at the next World Cup, given that you will be 38 then, should you not hang up your boots, and let a younger man take over?

MS: To answer that question, I am going to invite Kooky from the Harare Tribune to come and sit next to me. Good. Tell me Kooky, do I look 34 to you (No Boss, you look 24). Did you see me running up and down the stairs before this conference, and was I short of breath? (No Boss, you looked super fit). Do you think I’ll be fit enough to captain India at the next World Cup? (Sure thing MS, I mean Boss). Satisfied, Boria? Go back to Kolkata to your maacher jhol and your rossogollas.

Q: Finally MS, what do you think of Faiz Fazal as a prospect?

MS: I know Zimbabwe has many expats in their team, but I have yet to come across this Fazal chap. Sorry, what was that? He is in my team? (looks at his team sheet). Oh heck, you are quite right. Faiz Fazal, yeah. Good top spin googly bowler. No, no that’s Chahal. I think he is an aggressive middle order batsman who can also turn his arm over. We’ll see at the nets.

Updated: Mar 10, 2020 16:09 IST

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar wants the Board of Control for Cricket in India to come up with a plan in order to organise a Women’s Indian Premier League (IPL) in the country from 2021. Gavaskar believes that the Indian team unearthed several talents in the T20 World Cup and having an IPL now would only help the players grow which would be beneficial for the Indian team in the longer run.

“As far as the BCCI is concerned, they are already doing a lot and which is the reason why this Indian women’s team has progressed so much. They went to Australia almost a month before the tournament started, and played a 3-match T20I series (tri-series) against the Australians,” Gavaskar told India Today.

“They did well over there. They were very well acclimated to the conditions and the pitches in Australia. So you have got to give credit to the BCCI for having done that,” he further added.

“To Sourav Ganguly and the BCCI, I would like to say, maybe next year, look at having a women’s IPL because that will unearth a lot more talent. There is already a lot of talent which we see and that will come to the fore with this performance of this Indian team throughout this tournament.

“The Australian cricket board has backed Australian women’s team for a long, long time. The Women’s Big Bash League has given plenty of opportunities to players, even our players. The likes of Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet they have played in the WBBL. That is the tournament where you get to play against the best players and learn from that,” the former India captain added.

“It (IPL) has gone deep into the interiors of India. We have got youngsters coming up from the interiors of India and showing their skills. Therefore, that much wider talent pool is available for selection. That’s exactly what happened with the Australian WBBL.”","‘To Sourav Ganguly and the BCCI, I would like to say...’ - Sunil Gavaskar hopes Indian board comes up with new tournament",2074,2.217936355
2998,0,"After giving full credit to Shri Rahul Gandhi for formulating, scoping, advocating, canvassing support and finally suggesting the title – the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement – for the recently passed Land Acquisition bill, Union Rural Development Minister Shri Jairam Ramesh has gone ahead and credited Rahul Gandhi for the idea to credit Rahul Gandhi for conceiving, midwifing, spawning and christening the landmark legislation. Here are excerpts from his interview with The UnReal Times Lok Sabha correspondent, Kanun Borewala:

URT: Sir, how did Rahul get the idea to credit himself for the land acquisition law?

Jairam: Well, I was feeling very chuffed after crediting Rahul for virtually every aspect of this law. That’s when Rahulji suggested that why don’t I credit him also for suggesting that he be credited for the bill to complete the loop. I was awestruck, needless to say, and readily agreed to his absolutely brilliant suggestion.

URT: Sir, so let us get this straight. First, Rahul went on those padyatras, took extensive notes and inputs from all stakeholders, then came back and synthesized the various inputs to draft the bill?

Jairam: Absolutely, you couldn’t have put it better.

URT: Then he engaged in advocacy and ensured bipartisan support for the bill?

Jairam: Yep. I tell you that boy is a wunderkind. He combines charisma with intellect.

URT: Followed by his changing the title of the bill from the prosaic ‘Land Acquisition Act’ to the more impressive sounding ‘the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement’?

Jairam: Of course. Such a welcome change from calling it, say, the Rajiv Gandhi Aap ka Zameen Aap ke paas kanoon.

URT: And finally, he gave the idea to credit him as well for all this?

Jairam: Yes, that was the touch of class. I should have thought of it myself but even there Rahul baba was a step ahead of me.

URT: Sir, so if the Nehru-Gandhi scion handled everything – field research, synthesis and harmonization of inputs, drafting, generating consensus across the polity, changing the title to finally marketing it in such an ingenious manner – why does he need you as the Union Rural Development Minister? After all, you don’t even stand for Lok Sabha elections.

The boys now say they are not confident of beating Papua New Guinea either, considering it’s situated quite close to Australia. In the wake of India getting routed in under three days for the second time in succession to slump to its third worst defeat ever, the BCCI has proposed to do away with the 5 day format all together and replace it with 3 day Tests instead. “At least, that way the boys won’t be blamed for losing with two days to spare. And spectators, though disappointed that the boys lost, won’t feel cheated that they had to pay for 5 days’ fare. That could be the first of many baby steps towards rebuilding team morale,” a top BCCI official said.

“We should also do away with these 5 Test series and do short and sweet one off 3 day Tests whenever India tours England, South Africa or Australia,” the BCCI official noted. “Anyway only Indians watch Test matches being played anywhere in the world and right now I don’t think they are any more interested in watching India play these pointless 5 Test series abroad anymore. This will also give us more flexibility in planning the team’s international calendar around the IPL.” When a scribe dared to ask whether the IPL itself should be revamped to save Indian cricket, the BCCI official lost his temper and yelled back, “Don’t even go there.”

Other baby steps to rebuild morale include bringing back Dada, VVS, SRT and Dravid. “Had a chat with them and they say that although they are getting on in years, they can do slightly better than the current top order,” the BCCI official disclosed. “Ravi Shastri also said he can lend some balance to the team and take a break from clichéd commentary. So let’s see, at least we have back up plans going forward.”

In related news, the beleaguered Indian skipper got a heads-up from Dr Manmohan Singh amidst calls for the former’s resignation. “Only MS should decide when he wants to resign,” MMS said and disagreed with the prevailing view that this team’s tour had been disastrous. “History will judge the team better,” Dr Singh gently pointed out.",BCCI proposes to replace 5 day Tests with 3 day Tests in wake of rout,2204,1.724137931

Success has many fathers, failure is an orphan. No one knows this better than Indian sportsmen, who, as one columnist aptly put, should get Olympic medals for just putting up with the country’s incapable and overbearing sports officials. The politicians are no better. Soon after badminton champion PV Sindhu won a silver medal in the Rio Olympics, a tussle erupted between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over which state she belongs to. Many people and politicians in Telangana claimed Sindhu is their pride because she was born and brought up in Hyderabad and her father is from Telangana. Those from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh - which shares Hyderabad as capital till 2024 - countered that claim, saying that her mother is from Vijayawada. Then there were those who seemed to know the family’s history of relocations: They said her parents migrated to Hyderabad even before she was born and that she is a “typical” Hyderabadi. Other reports suggested that a large number of people were googling her caste when she was playing the finals.

Read: After Olympic success, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana spar over PV Sindhu

This tendency of putting some kind of a tag on winners is wrong. Soon after Sakshi Malik won bronze in wrestling, people including senior political leaders started calling her “India’s daughter” and we were even reminded helpfully that victory came on the auspicious day of raksha bandhan. Some saluted the “woman, the athlete and the Indian” in her when all we should have been celebrating her success as an Indian champ. Even in her moment of glory, we selfishly did not forget to appropriate her success by force-pasting some ludicrous patriarchal label on her forehead.

Read: Put it this way: Sakshi Malik is India’s champion

Coming back to PV Sindhu, it is also sad to see that when it came to giving her cash prizes for her stupendous achievement, the two states tried to outdo each other just to prove her state lineage, as if she will opt for the state which gives her more money. The announcement of cash bonuses for both PV Sindhu and coach P Gopichand should have be made in a civil and sophisticated manner befitting a champion who deserves every bit of it. Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should stop playing such petty regional games over the badminton star and accept that she does not belong to any state/region/caste/linguistic group. PV Sindhu, Dipa Karmakar and Sakshi Malik don’t belong to any one particular state anymore; they are jewels in India’s crown.

3001,0,"The CAG report tabled in Parliament today, which has estimated losses to the exchequer to the tune of Rs. 1.86 L crores due to discretionary, non-auction based allocation of coal blocks to 25 companies, may have caused a furore in political circles but has inspired Bollywood mogul Rakesh Roshan to announce a reboot of his yesteryear movie Koyla.

“I was casually browsing through the CAG report about procedural flaws in coal block allocations, greedy private companies seeking to grab coal, devious back-room deals, conniving babus, and the lead character of the Prime Minister himself, who was then heading the coal sector, playing a mute spectator to the proceedings.

It then struck me to remake Koyla, based on the CAG script, with Dr. Manmohan Singh reprising SRK’s role as the mute protagonist. Never been so creatively excited in my life man,” disclosed the father of Hrithik Roshan.

The ace director conceded that the script had some glaring gaps and would need to be reworked a bit. “Of course, there’s no eye candy or context for item numbers. Not to worry, I’ll create some space for Madhuri Dixit in the plot and insert some item numbers,” disclosed Roshan.

The ace director will now make the movie on an epic scale thanks to Anil Ambani’s Reliance Entertainment agreeing to finance the venture in return for Anil getting a meaty role in the movie. Incidentally, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Power was mentioned as one of the beneficiaries in the CAG report.

But the real casting coup is of Dr. Manmohan Singh essaying the lead role. “That’s right. Initially Dr. Singh was reluctant to play a screen hero saying he is only good at acting as the Prime Minister. But after I told him that he won’t have any dialogues and will get to share screen space with Madhuri Dixit, he gave his tacit consent by silently nodding his head. Isn’t that awesome?” raved Roshan.

3002,0,"The specter of match-fixing has returned to haunt the Pakistani team once again, this time for convincingly beating the world’s top ranked Test team, South Africa, by nearly an innings in Abu Dhabi. The International Cricket Council’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) is all set to probe suspicious patterns during the course of five days of one sided Test cricket: Pakistani batsmen displaying immaculate technique and temperament against the South African pacers, Pakistani fielders exhibiting unusual degrees of agility to dive and save runs, Pakistani bowlers displaying extraordinary commitment in dismissing the hapless South Africans twice over. “The fact that Pakistan dominated and outplayed South Africa in all sessions and all departments has set alarm bells ringing. These were all classic signs of unusual activity,” said an ACSU official.

The ACSU, which was previously looking into whether some Pakistani players had colluded with bookies to throw the previous Test match against Zimbabwe, will now change course and probe whether the same players again took money this time to win against the top ranked team.

Investigators believe large sums of money may have been exchanged between players and bookmakers operating from the Middle East in return for Pakistani players raising their level of game to steamroll the opposition. The Pakistani openers, skipper Misbah and premium off-spinner, Saeed Ajmal, are under the scanner for their match-winning performances. It did not help either when Misbah quipped hours after his side’s triumph that his boys always believed in beating the odds.

The Pakistani Cricket Board has extended all support to the ICC to get to the bottom of the matter. “The PCB maintains a zero tolerance policy on corruption and if is established that some players took money to win the match, they will be banned,” a PCB official said.

These reports have greatly unnerved Pakistani players. “Morale is very low in the team now. We have to make sure we come out and put up our worst performance in the next match and lose badly to clear the whiff of suspicion hanging over our heads,” said Misbah-ul-Haq, appearing even more dour than usual.",Match fixing charges haunt Pakistan again after they defeat world’s top ranked Test team,2189,1.690269529

The Congress Vice President had said during his brief interaction with the press after the poll results were announced that “the Aam Aadmi Party involved a lot of non-traditional people and we will learn from that…and will better it in a way you cannot imagine.”

This will be Rahul Gandhi’s first real job in his career. He had briefly worked as a management consultant after graduation which of course doesn’t count and no one is really sure what exactly he’s been doing since he entered politics. Congress leaders have welcomed Rahul’s move. “Rahul baba has embarked on a discovery of India ever since he entered politics but his learning curve has plateaued of late,” a senior Congress leader said. “He has some fuzzy ideas but is not sure how to communicate, let alone implement, them. Hopefully, the internship with AAP will inspire him into action.”

Arvind Kejriwal confirmed he has received Rahul’s application and said the Nehru-Gandhi scion is free to work for his party as an unpaid intern. However, Kejriwal said he’s not sure what job to give him. “The boy doesn’t seem to have any tangible skills,” the AAP supremo observed. “So I requested him to take up social media activities including tweeting on behalf of AAP with hash-tags such as #KejriwalsweepsDelhi but he refuses to be on Twitter because his mummy has told him it is poison. He offered to write speeches for me but I am reluctant to utilize him for that. For the time being, I’ve told him to simply hang around just like he does in the Congress and sporting an AAP cap.”

Rahul meanwhile has already commenced on what he does best: visiting residences of AAP leaders and having dinner with them. “I’ve already visited Sisodiya uncle’s house and had a tasty dish of dal-baati. Next I’ll be visiting Shazia Illmi’s place for biryani,” the Nehru-Gandhi scion said of his ongoing internship.",Rahul Gandhi joins AAP as intern after noting that Congress needs to learn from Arvind Kejriwal,1990,1.658291457

But the collection trends are very opposed to the real mood of the audience here. People are really angry with the new offering from Bhai and have termed it his worst movie ever. Salman Khan’s Race 3 has not only been widely criticised by critics but also ranks among the worst rated Hindi films on IMDB. According to the most recent ratings from the website, the film has a rating of 2.6/10, the same as Akshay Kumar’s Tees Maar Khan (2010). Afraid of people attacking him anytime soon, Shera, Salman’s bodyguard has hired a bodyguard for himself too. He is pretty sure that when a crowd of people will attack bhai, even he won’t be spared and so it makes sense to have a personal bodyguard for himself too.

Shera who has been protecting bhai for so many years confessed that he had never seen such public anger for any of his previous films. He is pretty sure that people will start attacking him also due to the extreme anger. He had requested bhai to provide him a bodyguard and bhai being the human he is, agreed to do so. Shera has been interviewing many candidates for the role of his bodyguard and will soon finalize one.

The role of Shera’s bodyguard will be to protect Shera while Shera is protecting bhai. Given the public response of Race 3, it won’t be a surprise if Shera’s bodyguard also hires a bodyguard for himself.

After lambasting the iniquitous Mayawati Government for denying the people of UP their fundamental rights, Rahul shouted “Sada Haq, Aithe Rakh” and pointed a finger in the direction of a Mayawati statue, sending the crowd into frenzy. Attired in trademark Ranbir Kapoor garb – long tresses, baggy salwaar trousers, week old stubble and a guitar – Rahul swooned and swayed to the catchy beat, rebellion and rage written over his face, even as the assembled crowd began to head-bang in unison.

Rahul’s performance has impressed both politicos and Bollywood personalities. “Rahul, by his game changing speech..er…I mean song… er… I mean lip-syncing… whatever… has changed the nature of political discourse in this country. The whole nation is dancing to his tune now,” gushed Congress spokesperson, Manish Tiwari, before shouting “Aithe rakh” to the office chai wallah who had forgotten to place a cup of tea on his table.

Rahul’s new found cult following has shaken up his political opponents who are frantically trying to replicate his methods. BSP supremo, Maywati, is diligently practicing Nargis Fakhri’s dance steps to the other hit number from Rockstar, “Tinga linga linga linga… Katiya Karoon” in a bid to demonstrate to the UP electorate that her heart pines for their love and affection. BJP leaders, on the other hand, have taken permission from popular macho band Metallica and will perform a desi version of their hit song “For whom the bell tolls” (“sabka ghanta baja hua hai”) in Lucknow, with Nitin Gadkari behind the drums, Rajnat Singh as the bassist and Arun Jaitley as lead vocalist.

However, Rahul Gandhi’s new found rebellious streak is causing friction within the party, sources close to 10, Janpath revealed. When the Environment Minister sought his permission to implement her new environmental conservation policy, the Nehru-Gandhi scion indicated his dissatisfaction by singing in a sarcastic tone, “O Eco Friendly, Nature ke Rakshak, Main bhi hoon Nature.”

“I think Rahul ji was telling me poetically to go back to the drawing board and reframe our environmental policies. Ever since he saw that stupid Rockstar move, it’s become so difficult to impress him these days,” sighed Union Environment Minister, Jayanthi Natarajan.

After spending sleepless nights for not getting media attention, the core committee of AAP realized the only way to counter the popularity of Udta Punjab was to come up with a movie. It was completed in record time and given a 5 star rating by Shri Kejriwal himself.

Udta Aam Aadmi is an action drama film produced by the in-house production team of Mr. Kejriwal, The Aam Aadmi Entertainment, a renowned name in movie fraternity that has often promoted fresh talents in the field of arts and entertainment, and it’s a dream for any producer to get his/her movie reviewed by Mr. Kejriwal.

The movie is a biopic on Aam Aadmi Party chief, Arvind Kejriwal , which portrays the struggles of common people of Delhi and how the revolutionary fights the evils of the society.

Spoiler alert! Please do not read the following plot summary if you have not seen the film

Plot

The protagonist, Arvind Kejriwal, is a goatherd in a village called Delhi who is constantly troubled by the sufferings of his fellow villagers. One day, he assumes that the village sarpanch Ajeeb Jung and thanedaar M.S. Bassi are responsible for all their hardships and wages war against them. As the clock strikes midnight, he disguises himself with a muffler and throws stones at Ajeeb Jung’s house while his friend Kumar Viswas hides behind a tree and sings, “Andheri raaton mein sunsaan rahon par.”

He soon realizes that Jung and Bassi are just pawns and the real villain is an evil dictator called Gajendra Modi, and decides to use Jung and Bassi as tools to reach Modi. Meanwhile, Jung complains to Modi about Kejriwal who sends his soldiers to Kejriwal’s house to steal his ‘odd-even’ formula, which is believed to be the best work by any mathematician post the demise of Ramanujan. Enraged and embittered, Kejriwal reaches Modi’s palace and thunders, “You coward and psychopath!” He challenges Modi to a face off and menacingly walks towards him with his gaze fixed on the throne. The movie ends there with a message flashing on the screen – “The beginning.”

Udta Aam Aadmi was screened at Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday and received critical acclaim, and it will release in theaters on July 6th, forcing Aditya Chopra, the producer of Sultan to postpone the release date of his movie to avoid box office clash.","Frustrated over losing media attention to Udta Punjab, Kejriwal releases own film ‘Udta Aam Aadmi’",2461,1.747257213

During the week, cinema halls are mostly empty and we get nice air-conditioned space for 3 hrs at a very cheap price. Of course weekends don’t work for us as ticket prices are too high for college students like us plus it is very crowded as well. However, Dangal has thrown a spanner into our plan, we no longer get an empty cinema hall even during weekdays.”

“For us, the happy hours used to start from Monday morning. As our friends entered class room, we used to settle down in some corner of an empty theater near our college. All our relatives used to be at work so there was no risk of getting caught either. Alas, Jaane kahan gaye wo din”, Anuj sighed.

India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar shared a message for Harmanpreet Kaur & co. as India get ready to play Australia in the final of Women’s T20 World Cup in Melbourne next week on Monday. India reached the final of the tournament for the first time after their semifinal clash against England was washed out. With no reserve day, India qualified for the final, as the tournament rules dictated that the team finishing higher in the group stages will progress further.

Speaking to news agency ANI at an event in Mumbai, Tendulkar, who was part of India’s 2011 World Cup winning campaign, shared an inspiring message for the team.

“Just live in the moment and play the finals. I was there next to the trophy when I was in Australia and few members of our women’s team were there with me. I told them that it would be nice to see you with the trophy back in India,” he said.

“My message to them would be to go out and give your best. I would tell them to not take any pressure. They don’t need to spend time with the outside world. I have watched their performances and they have inspired so many youngsters,” the Master Blaster added.

He further said: “It is about bringing laurels to our nation, so many athletes in different fields have brought laurels to our nation, this would be another one. Go and enjoy yourself.”

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final against defending champions Australia after their last-four clash against England was washed out on Thursday, prompting both captains to say that reserve days are essential for knockout clashes.Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, taking Indians into the summit clash and leaving England players in tears.

India will take on four-time winners Australia, who defeated South Africa by five runs in what was also a rain-hit semifinal match, curtailed to 13 overs after Australia’s innings. The two teams will clash on Sunday, which also happens to be International Women’s Day.

This, the numerologist had then assured Amma, would remove all irritants and keep her in power for the rest of her life.

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

At a press conference held to make this announcement, Finance Minister Mr. P Chidambaram said, “The economy is in a bad shape. Inflation is high. Investor confidence is low and so is the value of the rupee. Under these circumstances, we wanted to do what any government would do – rename stuff.”

Clarifying the circumstances and reasoning behind the re-branding, Mr. Chidambaram said, “It would be prudent to not speculate over the re-branding. We could have named it after Rajiv Gandhi or Indira Gandhi, but we wanted to send a strong message to the communal forces while examining the possibility of implementing some much needed reforms in the banking sector as well.”

When asked to explain the nature of these reforms, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Well, we are in the process of implementing multiple interest rates for different sections of society. The details will be in the public domain shortly after it is approved by the UPA Chairperson. The gist of the whole thing is that we have always wanted inclusive growth. Now that it does not seem possible, we want to give pain to all sections of society in equal measure.”

He also added, “We made sure we gave the people a holistic banking system,” with a wink.

RBI Governor, Mr. D Subbarao, who was also present at the press conference, stated that the State Bank and its five Associate Banks will be renamed according to the new directive. He also announced the formation of a parallel credit rating agency, which would rate your secularism based on which loans would be granted.

Explaining this further, Mr. Subbarao said, “We have something called the Secular Quotient, let’s call it SQ. Now, SQ is an index of all your activities online and offline. Your posts on Twitter, Facebook and other social media would be analysed for secularity by an algorithm provided by our Joint Chief Secular Officers, Ms. Barkha Dutt and Ms. Sagarika Ghose.”

“Of course, for minorities, SC/STs, OBCs and holders of secularism certificate personally signed by either Ms. Barkha Dutt or Ms. Sagarika Ghose will automatically have the highest SQ”, the FM added.

Bank officials seemed quite enthusiastic about the move. “I am very happy about this. It will help us get more deposits that would in turn help us make sound financial decisions like rescuing a certain airline,” said a highly-placed source from the new Secular Bank of Mysore’s Head Office (curiously located in Bangalore).

Within hours of announcement of his new movie, Mahesh Bhatt had to face protests from various quarters over his ‘queer’ decision.

“This man has only one mission – to help Pakistan by hurting India. Is there any dearth of horses in India? In fact Indian horses are far better than Pakistanis as they have regularly acted in movies, with celebrated roles like Badal in Mard and Dhanno in Sholay. Do we know the name of a single Pakistani horse?” Abhijeet Ghodal, one of the protestors said.

A still from Horse Dance festival in Pakistan: Mahesh Bhatt maintains that Pakistani horses can dance better

Mahesh Bhatt has rejected such allegations and has counter alleged that the protestors were religious extremists and jingoists. He claimed that Pakistani horses were better dancers and he needed a dancing horse for the movie, rumored to be titled “Zakhmi Ghoda”. It is also rumored that there will be a kissing scene with the horse as Bhatt has again signed Emraan Hashmi for his movie.

“I am going for Pakistani horses because the script demands so. Others are protesting because their political bosses demand so. I will not surrender before the communal forces and will not change my decision. Unlike those fools, I am a broad-minded person.” Mahesh Bhatt averred.

This explanation has not cut ice with the protestors and many are planning to parade dancing Indian horses in front of Mahesh Bhatt’s house tomorrow. The protestors insist that the locals should always be preferred over foreigners and all efforts should be made to provide employments to locals first. A get together of Indian horse lovers has also been called at Gateway of India tomorrow.

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless.

Far from being pleased with the fan’s observation, Kohli responded, “Okay, I don’t think you should live in India then… you should go and live somewhere else, no?.

But the story didn’t end there. Yesterday Kohli got angry on KL Rahul and asked him to leave India and settle down in France after he ordered French Fries at a restaurant where they were both having a snack.

KL Rahul is a big fan of the French Fries and asked Kohli also to eat from his plate. This left Kohli red-faced and he asked Rahul to immediately leave the restaurant as he thought that Rahul is anti-Indian and he should not be present in India. Kohli also called up the selectors and told them that Players who love the country and don’t praise foreign things or foreign people only should be allowed to represent India in the cricket team.

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

The UK Budget tabled by Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to make the cost of long-term visas to Britain higher with a major hike in the compulsory health fee charged on migrants from countries, including India.

Sunak, born in the UK to a general practitioner father and pharmacist mother, announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) would be hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds.

“Migrants benefit from our NHS (National Health Service). And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.

The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.

The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.

The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.

Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.

“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.

“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.

Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.","In Indian-origin UK finance minister Rishi Sunak’s budget, Britain visas to get costlier",3305,2.08774584

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

3027,0,"Hyderabad. Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has offered Indian players to the visiting Australian team that is suffering from grave injury problems causing many of their players to go back home. Keeping with the homegrown rules of Indian cricket, Indian captain has offered his Australian counterpart a chance to play Indian players in their side for the remaining matches of the series. As a result, Munaf Patel and Dinesh Karthik could be playing for Australia tomorrow.

“What we want here is a good contest. Offering our bench strength to the visiting team will not only ensure that we have a good match but also help our boys, who have been warming benches, to have some match practice. This will also help revive the traditional Indian gully cricket culture, where in two captains flipped a coin to decide who picks which player”, Dhoni said.

Ponting: Thanks mate, we have already given you a lot of IPL players.

Australian captain Ricky Ponting seemed pleased with the decision and has gracefully accepted the offer. Ponting was quite worried after his ace bowler Peter Siddle had to pull out of last match and was sent back home. Siddle was the fourth player after Brett Lee, Tim Paine and James Hopes who returned home. Australia were already without Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Callum Ferguson and Nathan Bracken, and people wondered if a playing eleven for Australia was possible in such a situation.

“At the end what matters is a good game of cricket. Munaf would be spearheading our bowling attack and Karthik will be keeping wickets. We thank Dhoni for setting up foundation for an exciting contest. Not only will this give a good game, it will also be for the world to see how well the Aussies gel with the Indians (referring to recent attacks on Indian Students in Australia).” Ponting hoped.

But the player, who is being much talked about here, didn’t seem quite happy with the decision. “I have played with Shane Warne, and they (Aussies) make you exercise a lot and run till the last breath. Right now, I am happy just sitting and relaxing at the boundary. I’m not complaining and I’m getting my fee due. They should have asked me before deciding.” Munaf expressed his unhappiness.

A few other senior players too have expressed unhappiness, including Zaheer Khan, RP Singh, Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Pathan. They wonder why they were not asked to play for Australia. “They are more than willing to play and sweat out in the field”, says Abhishek Desh, Manager, Café Coffee Day outlet in Andheri (West), Mumbai where these players keep on relaxing all day.

Though, it will be quite a contest to see now with these new developments, rumors are steaming in from the other side of the world about the sequel to movie Blue. It seems that after trying out Australian singer-actress Kylie Minogue in Blue, now the producers want to try Australian cricketers for the sequel, hoping to be lucky second time. Suspicions are being raised that Australian cricketers are shying away from international duties to conserve energy for the auditions.

3028,0,"Reeling under the effects of soaring prices of tomatoes, which have now begun to cost as much as Rs.100 a kg in some parts of the country, Bollywood directors have unanimously decided to give up the age-old tradition of using tomato sauce in place of blood during violent scenes in their movies. In what is supposed to be a significant cost-saver, the directors have now decided to use real human blood instead.

According to director Rohit Shetty, inflicting real wounds on the actor and getting them treated later or using real human blood from banks would cost still lesser than splurging cash on tomato sauce. “Desperate times require desperate measures. Thanks to the inflation, my movie budgets have multiplied manifold. One of the ways to save money would be to prevent scores of jeeps from unnecessarily blowing up, but then it wouldn’t be a Rohit Shetty movie. The only other way to minimize cost is by getting rid of tomato sauce bottles for real human blood and that’s what we’re doing. We’ve already begun to err..reap the fruits of our sacrifice,” the Dilwale director told The UnReal Times.

Strongly agreeing with Shetty was Bollywood’s dark film director Anurag Kashyap, who is currently gung ho about his recently released, highly controversial film, Udta Punjab. “Thanks to Udta Tomatoes, I’m going bananas. But this is good, in a way. Whenever I’ve to fight Pahlaj Nihalani next, I’m sure I can get away by gifting him a box of ripe tomatoes,” an amused Kashyap said.

The effects of rising tomato prices aren’t just limited to Bollywood’s directors it seems. India’s gold connoisseur and music director Bappi Lahiri admitted that he recently pledged a couple of his gold necklaces at Muthoot Finance, in order to afford a basket of ripe tomatoes for his household. Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan is reported to have banned tomatoes at his residence for the moment. According to the Big B, presence of tomatoes would unnecessarily evoke another round of suspicion regarding his wealth, in light of the Panama and Essar leaks which have mired the actor.

3029,0,"Under pressure to respond after the US State Department announced a $10M bounty for information leading to the conviction of Hafiz Saeed, the Indian government announced its own offer – a year’s worth of subsidized petrol for daily commute, which is by far the highest reward ever offered for one of the most wanted men on India’s list of terror suspects.

Announcing this at a press conference, S.M. Krishna, India’s foreign minister said, “We took a look at the $10M offered by the Americans, which is really not much if you consider what the Chennai Super Kings paid for Ravindra Jadeja. So we decided to up the ante. Our offer should send a strong signal to Mr Hafiz Saeed that we are serious this time.” The minister did not however clarify if the petrol was regular or premium grade. “Let’s face it. The sooner we catch him, the sooner our President can pardon him,” he added.

While soaring petrol prices (and prices of pretty much everything else except stock market shares) have been widely regarded by analysts and pundits as a political liability for the UPA government, the latest move seemed to be designed to cleverly use rising petrol prices as a potent weapon in the war on terrorism. Intelligence sources from the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) said that there had been a major spike in activities related to the search for Mr. Saeed in the 24 hours following the minister’s announcement.

Mr Saif Ali Khan, producer and hero of the Bollywood flick “Agent Vinod” was one of many bounty hunters who had packed his bags and was seen heading for the mountains of Pakistan in the wake of the announcement. “The way things are going, by the time someone actually finds any evidence to incriminate Saaed, a year’s worth of petrol could be worth crores of rupees,” Mr. Khan explained over a telephonic chat. “Everyone knows that I lost my shirt on Agent Vinod. This may be my only way of recovering from that horrible setback. What to do, yaar, I started as Agent Vinod, and now I’ve become a collection agent,” he added. When informed that Ms Simi Garewal has already reached Karachi in hot pursuit of Mr Saeed and even recorded an interview with him which may perhaps even hold up in a Pakistani court of law, Mr Khan seemed alarmed and muttered “Dude, I got to run” before abruptly hanging up.

Encouraged by the response, ministry officials have leaked information that one year’s supply of LPG cylinders and 2 Tatra trucks might be thrown in as added incentive, which has literally added fuel to the fire of speculative bounty hunting.

“We’re fully confident that this attractive bounty will yield results, and we expect to get strong evidence to convict Mr Saeed. If this scheme fails, our plan B is to send in the Finding Nemo team from Disney,” said a ministry official under an assurance of anonymity.

Meanwhile, a nervous Mr Saeed is rumored to have joined Google+ in attempt to go incognito and avoid being spotted.

In other news, Mr Digvijay Singh, Congress Party spokesperson, fell from the third floor balcony of a hotel room, and suffered a severe concussion as a result. However, doctors said that Mr Singh was recovering well and described his concussion as “a significant improvement over his normal state of mind.”

3030,0,"Taking a cue from Indian batting sensation Virat Kohli, PM Narendra Modi came down heavily on those who troll and mock BJP senior leader LK Advani, asking them to have some shame. Kohli had earlier launched a blistering attack on those who keep trolling his (ex- ?)girlfriend, actress Anushka Sharma during his victorious knocks and cheap dismissals.

The UnReal Times reproduces the PM’s post where he stood up for the BJP patriarch:

Bhaiyyon aur Behnon,

Shame on those people who have been having a go at Advaniji for the longest time and connecting every negative thing for me to a positive thing for him. Shame on those people calling themselves educated. Shame on blaming and making fun of him when he has no political ambitions or happiness over what bad thing happens to me. The only goal he has in life right now is defeating Murli Manohar Joshi in games of rummy. If anything he has only motivated and given me more positivity. This was long time coming. Shame on these people that hide and take a dig. And I don’t need any respect for this post. Have some compassion and respect him. He is as good as a Mohanlal Gandhi figure for the BJP. In fact, ADVANI stands for A Dynamic, Vital Asset of National Importance. Think of how your grandfather or great-grandfather would feel if someone trolled them and very conveniently rubbished them in public. May the force be with you, Advaniji! #nocompassion #nocommonsense

While Advani himself is yet to respond, the PM was flooded with heaps of praise from his colleagues and party men. “I congratulate Shri @narendramodi for standing up for Shri Advaniji. About time!” tweeted Madhya Pradesh CM and India’s congratulator-in-chief, Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The PM’s gesture also received praise from the quarters of other seniors like former Tamil Nadu CM M Karunanidhi, legal legend Ram Jethmalani as well as from juvenile senior Shahid Afridi, who said that even he didn’t receive so much love from Kashmir.

Taking the PM’s idea forward, Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad announced that his ministry would automatically communicate a “resignation demand” to the employers of Advani trolls, seeking to terminate their employment with immediate effect.

The Indian media, however, claimed that with this post, emergency had been unofficially declared and that fascism was obvious like never before. “Trolling is a form of free speech and expression and in the world’s largest democracy, it can’t be suppressed. With Modi’s latest post, is the fascism now fully blatant?” tweeted NDTV’s Barkha Dutt, before blocking several Right-Wing trolls. India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai too, lashed out at the PM instantly. “I may not agree with who you troll, but I’ll defend until death, your right to troll,” Rajdeep said, before abusing and beating up a troll on the street.

While the Congress party is yet to react, BJP MP Shatrugan Sinha, however, lambasted the PM for ‘double standards.’ ”On one hand, you talk about respecting Advaniji while on the other hand, you came to power by relentlessly trolling Manmohan Singh.

After a spate of rape cases in Uttar Pradesh, the latest being rape of a women judge in the city, rape survivors whose lives were spared by the criminals, have appealed to the UP government to show same level of sympathy and concern towards them as is shown by them towards the rapists.

Arguing that Samajwadi Party leaders are not as malevolent and inhumane as they are made out to be, the survivors urged them to use their benevolence and humanity at the right place and for the right causes.

The father-son duo laughing off such appeals.

“Look at Mulayam ji’s concern for rapists and how strongly he defended and batted for them during elections; he surely can’t be that cruel and shameless,” one of the signatories of the appeal pointed out.

“If Mulayam Singh and Azam Khan could be half as compassionate towards us as they are towards rapists and buffaloes respectively, our lives would be much better and safe,” the signatory claimed.

The signatories further claimed that they may be a minority at present in comparison to rapists and molesters at large in the state, but their population has been rising thanks to the law and order situation in the state.

“If numbers are all that matters to the leaders, we have them in plenty. We don’t even ask for jobs, development, etc. All we need is protection and some mercy,” a rape survivor cited some demographic trends, hoping to fetch Samajwadi Party supremo’s attention.

While the appeal has been backed by many, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has accused these survivors of being sensationalist and ignorant.

“They should google about rape survivors in other states of India and other parts of the world. No special treatment can be given to them,” Akhilesh showcased his higher education, which strengthened his knowledge on internet and international issues.

Sources say that some of the rape survivors did search for “compassion” on Google, and the result was: “The results are blocked in your region by authorities.”",Rape survivors request UP govt to show same sympathy as they show towards rapists,1995,1.704260652

Now this should make the IPL5 very successphul.”

Rajiv Shukla hastened to assure television spectators and Sony executives that the abbreviated format would not reduce the volume of entertainment and the ad-space that goes with it, but only change the mix of entertainment: The innings themselves would be spaced out with bigger, better and many more on-field / dugout interviews. Besides interviewing team owners, coaches, players, players’ wives and girlfriends and cheerleaders, Shibani Dandekar and Archana Vijaya would now indulge in cute chit-chats with the coaches and players’ mothers and grandmothers, the cheerleaders’ husbands and boyfriends, the owners’ children and the owners’ pets.

Extra Innings, meanwhile, would continue to be scheduled at 7pm on single game days, and 3pm on double-header days. To compensate for the reduced on-field action, each session of Extra Innings would now feature a second group of in-studio cheerleaders, a second DJ, one additional female anchor with a fake British accent, one additional female anchor with a fake American accent, and at least four more cricketing jokers experts. Gaurav Kapoor will fill in with inane one liners, and engage cricketing legends in lengthier and completely pointless conversations. IPL has already sounded out all known former cricketers with the exception of Kapil Dev.

The commentary team has been quick to adapt to the new format as well. Cricketing legend, Sunny Gavaskar was initially heard shouting “That’s just not cricket” upon being informed about the development, and sulked for several hours at the ‘desecration of Cricket’, but quickly fell in line after the BCCI reminded him about his contract.

The Little Master later showcased his rich experience and deep cricketing acumen as he explained to a rapt Simon Doull that T2 was nothing but the final state in cricket’s natural evolution. “When we first started finding Test Cricket boring, we did away with four days and came up with One Day Cricket. When we started finding the ODI boring, we did away with the middle overs and came up with T20. Now that most T20 matches seem to be getting exciting only in the final 2 overs, T2 is the obvious logical conclusion,” Sunny concluded, as an awestruck Doull concurred hastily.

Ravi Shastri did not need any persuasion, however. “Just what the doctor ordered to cure viewer fatigue. Now every game should go down to the wire,” he intoned.",Remaining IPL5 T-20 matches converted to T-2 (2 over per innings) format to address viewer fatigue,3241,2.098117865
3036,0,"New Delhi. Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, who had still not recovered from the article written by colleague Shashi Tharoor effusively praising Modi, received another jolt yesterday, when he read news reports of Rahul Gandhi exchanging pleasantries with Modi with later clasping former’s hands warmly.

Ever since Tharoor wrote that article, Aiyar has been keeping a close watch on the conduct of other elected congress MPs as well.

The Rajya Sabha MP from Congress who lost recent elections, has been caught on several occasions by parliament staff trying to peep into the proceedings of Lok Sabha to see if those MPs are keeping a distance from Modi.

“Rahul Baba request you to please stay away from me”

If reports are to believed the veteran Modi critic is blessed and god gifted with the ability to smell and find if there is any proximity between Modi and any other Congress leader.

“The other day he was in canteen when one MP came out after a session. Aiyar ji immediately started sniffing that MP’s clothes and hands, as if trying to ascertain something. And before we could understand what was happening, he threw his tea on that MP blasting him,” Aiyar’s close aide told Faking News.

“It was later that we realized that the MP had shook hands with Modi,” the aide further revealed.

This time too Aiyar did not believe the news reports first, and decided to confirm it first hand.

Sources tell initially Aiyar was terribly incensed, but later realizing that it was Rahul Gandhi and not Tharoor whom he could blast, Aiyar cooled down.

“He had even brought an axe to chop off Rahul Gandhi’s hands as he felt that Gandhi scion was now infected and possessed danger to other congress leaders,” a staff of Congress headquarters disclosed.

But as the better sense prevailed, he profusely apologized to Rahul and requested him to wash his hands with Dettol and pure water before the diseases spreads.

As he could not find pure water inside parliament premises on short notice, he requested Sonia Gandhi to spare some gargled water.

Later to make up for his blunder of doubting Rahul Gandhi, Aiyar wrote another piece on NDTV, blaming Tharoor again and holding him responsible for the strange manner in which MPs have been behaving.",Mani Shankar Aiyar asks Rahul Gandhi to wash his hands after Modi clasped them,2248,1.423487544

The legendary Kapoor family of Hindi cinema, whose four generations have not only acted but contributed to shaping and nurturing the industry, has decided to sell the iconic RK Studio in Chembur, according to reports this week. The process of negotiation has apparently begun. It could take months or years, but what is certain is the family’s resolve to sell the space, though with “a heavy heart”, as actor Rishi Kapoor told a tabloid.

There is nothing overtly political about the act of selling off a piece of legacy. Such decisions tend to be personal and circumstantial, sometimes purely commercial. The Kapoor family, by all reckoning, are an emotional lot, bonded by their shared heritage and place in the film industry, and unlikely to have made the decision only on commercial basis. How the renowned actor-filmmaker, the late Raj Kapoor, might have reacted is anybody’s guess. Yet, it is political in a way.

RK Studio symbolises something uniquely urban: A personal space of great public, historic or heritage value but which is neither cared for by the industry or the city. This isn’t the first nor will it be the last. The hostel and printing press set up by Dr BR Ambedkar were razed. Textile mills were replaced by malls and offices, and other film studios by gleaming towers.

Work spaces and homes of famous personalities, spaces steeped in historical value which speak to present generations, are a living heritage of Mumbai. They deserve more than what the Mumbai administrators have offered so far, focussed as they have been on built architectural heritage that too largely in the southern tip.

Despite the city being the de facto headquarters of Hindi cinema and a hub for alternative cinema, it got a film museum only four years ago. Could RK Studio have been turned into a memorial to the one of the greatest showman of the business in a way that preserved its essence but also allowed his descendants commercial returns? Could the city, the industry, and Kapoor family have partnered to create something new? Could this model have been replicated for other similar sites?

In the decline and imminent sale of the once sought-after studio lie many stories about Mumbai: The spatial shift of the cinema industry itself away from Chembur to the western parts of Andheri and Goregaon, the inescapable perennial traffic congestion which makes the commute to Chembur and back tedious for many, the availability of modern state-of-the-art studios, the speculative but dizzying prices of real estate, the premium on redevelopment of old and iconic properties. Also, it symbolises a city impatient with its past, making invisible certain aspects of itself.

Ironically, this is at a time when the leisure industry, including Bollywood, has expanded. The industry celebrates Ranbir Kapoor, but contributes little to maintain his grandfather’s heritage. This is also a time when the middle class is more visible or vocal than in pre-liberalisation years. It begs the questions: Do commercial boom and an empowered middle class mean selective amnesia; do they lead to what’s called the politics of forgetting?

This is not only about places; it’s equally, or more so, about people. As the city expands and becomes richer – at least certain sections acquire more wealth and wealthy – the poor become invisible or are forgotten, banished as it were to the margins of the city, turned into totems of urban exoticism for tourists the way “poverty tours” are organised in Dharavi. Then, those who speak for the marginalised and ask difficult questions are branded (for example, that obnoxious term “urban naxals”), arrested and thrown into lock-ups.

The words of Prof David Harvey, the distinguished geographer and anthropologist who popularised the idea of “Right to City”, come to mind. “The question of what kind of city we want cannot be divorced from the question of what kind of people we want to be, what kinds of social relations we seek, what relations to nature we cherish, what style of life we desire, or what aesthetic values we hold,” he wrote.

3038,0,"Bangalore. Soon after the schedule for Karnataka Assembly elections were announced, intelligence agencies issued high alert for the entire state. However, this alert was not to warn civilians against possible terror strikes, but possible cheating by various tricksters who are suspected to get active as polling date gets nearer.

“We suspect a deluge of false promises, exaggerated claims, and fake shows of empathy in coming weeks,” a security officer revealed, “Citizens should be aware and prepare themselves for this eventuality.”

Such signs would be put across the state which will be ignored by the public

Security officials clarified that their job was not to act and stop such threats as they were part and parcel of the democratic process.

“The law of the land allows such things to happen, we can only ask people to be alert,” the official clarified.

It is the first time that such a high alert has been issued, even though experts and historians point out that such planned deception and hoax has been taking place periodically – at least once every five years.

“I think it’s too late and futile to issue this advisory and declare a state of high alert,” Ganesh Shenoy, an expert claimed, “People are now attuned to it. In fact, they look forward to it.”

Experts claim that the modus operandi of such tricksters is only not much different from the common cheats and frauds, especially those loot poor passengers in trains by making them unconscious after offering them drugged sweets.

“Like those common cheats, these tricksters get friendly with their targets and even voice concern over the ongoing loot by condemning fellow cheats. They offer sweet promises, and sometimes petty cash and liquor,” Ganesh drew the parallel.

“However there is one difference – while the common cheats vanish after the act, these special tricksters don’t do the vanishing act and instead come back again and again to rip off the unsuspecting citizens,” he added.

Experts further claim that this menace of looting through false promises will go beyond politics and elections in the coming weeks.

“IPL is coming up and some former employees of Kingfisher Airlines have threatened to stop matches of Royal Challengers Bangalore if their dues were not paid. In such a scenario, one can expect Vijay Mallya to adopt the same ticks by promising salaries, thus making the employees fall in line,” another expert explained how the high alert was relevant but futile.

When Faking News asked if the “high alert” would be of no use and might end up in yet another “intelligence failure”, experts answered in affirmative.

“Intelligence failure of the common man,” pat came the clarification.

Experienced middle-order batter Veda Krishnamurthy believes that “destiny” is in favour of first-time finalist India to win their maiden ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title provided they get a grip on their nerves in the summit clash against Australia here on Sunday. India will have a psychological advantage going into the final as they had stunned the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led India reached the final on the basis of their unbeaten record in the tournament after their semifinal against England was washed out on Thursday.

Krishnamurthy, who was a part of the Indian team that finished runner-up to England in the 2017 Women’s ODI World Cup, knows the pain of missing out on a world title.

“It’s all about destiny, and I’m a big believer in destiny. I feel like this is the way it was meant to be. There is a joke going around that this World Cup is made in such a way that it’s helping us, starting from the wickets to everything else,” she was quoted as saying by the tournament’s official website.

“Being in the final is just reward for the way we played in the group stages. There was an advantage to having won all our games with the weather not in our hands.”

The team’s first target of reaching the final having achieved, the 27-year-old player said the Indians now need to hold their nerves and remain focussed leading up to the big day on Sunday.

“We said the first aim was to get to the final and take it from there. We’ve crossed the first stage. We need to make sure we hold our nerves and we do what we need to do on the final day,” she said.

India’s recent rivalry with Australia has taken fascinating twists and turns, with Kaur’s outfit chasing down 173 in their recent tri-series and getting home by 17 runs in the T20 World Cup opener.

But all is not hunky-dory for Krishnamurthy on the personal front. Considered a great finisher, she has recovered from a series of single-digit scores in the tri-series to score 20 from 11 balls in a finishing role against Bangladesh. Having amassed just 35 runs from four matches in the tournament so far, the Karnataka batter knows her role in the team.

“As an individual, the role given to me is very consistent in the last year. They’ve put effort in the last year to keep me there and I’ve been supported by every individual, not just one or two. The entire team, with all the support staff have shown faith in me,” she said.

“I know coming into the World Cup, I would play a crucial role to finish the innings well, which I felt I was unable to do in the last World Cup in the West Indies,” she added.

Krishnamurthy said specific roles have been set for every player of the squad and they all are trying to contribute as much as they can to help the team achieve its goal.

“I was very motivated to do my role and I’ve been working on that. It’s not just me, all 15 players involved know what their role is,” she said.

“I’m happy we’re all putting in efforts and executing our role properly. Even if it’s a smallish contribution of saving a couple of runs, it’s all panned out really well.”",Women’s T20 World Cup final: ‘It’s all about destiny’ - Veda confident India can end trophy drought at MCG,3397,1.913453047

The producers of the show have denied the controversy and said that Amitabh was not feeling well and hence the shoot was canceled.

Faking News reporters reached Amitabh’s residence to know about his reason for the cancellation and he had this to say “Just like OLA Uber is bad for our economy as conveyed by Nirmala Sitharaman, I thought that a cab driver contestant would be inauspicious for the show. And just when the cab driver was about to explain to me the reason for him being a good person or a deserving candidate, Abhishek came to ask for his daily pocket money. I had to keep the phone down as Abhishek did not have a single penny and he was just about to leave to buy bread. So it was just an unwanted turn of events, and nothing was done intentionally.”

Sushma, who represents Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha in Parliament, had announced her decision in Indore yesterday where she had gone to canvass for the Assembly elections currently underway.

Soon after Sushma’s announcement, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta had come out in her support on Twitter. “Retiring from electoral politics on account of health issues doesn’t imply she is retiring from politics altogether. There is a great deal of contribution she can make to public life despite not being in the Lok Sabha,” he tweeted.

Appreciating his comment, Sushma tweeted, “You are right, Swapan. I am not retiring from politics. It is just that I am not contesting the next Lok Sabha election due to my health issues.”

Sushma has been suffering from diabetes and had undergone a kidney transplant in December 2016.

After tackling the issues of toilets and sanitary pads, Akshay Kumar will talk about the advantages of taking a bath in his upcoming film. The film is specifically aimed at engineering students and will be set in an NIT hostel.

Taking a bath has always been frowned upon in engineering hostels but Akshay Kumar hopes to convince some of them to start doing it daily with this movie. To do the research for the film, Akshay will spend one month in an Engineering hostel. Shooting for the film will start on 1st of August and will be completed by 2nd of August.

Speaking to Faking News, Akshay Kumar said,” I was drinking tea at a roadside dhaba last week where it was really smelly. When I asked the dhaba owner about it, he said there is an engineering hostel nearby and that is when the idea of this film clicked. I was told that these students take a bath only on the day they have a tough exam as they have to pray that day. This is simply unacceptable and as part of Swachh Bharat we must keep ourselves clean as well. I will motivate these youngsters through my film and if I make 100 Crores doing it, good for me.”

“So somewhere I had this feeling even this thing will not get coverage from Media, but the massiveness of the rift had me in two minds and I thought maybe they will,” Kejriwal confessed.

“Also I thought this time now that India has lost and these channels would have nothing else to discuss about cricket further and they would certainly shift focus to us. But thanks to Arnab and Times Now for setting the narrative and shifting focus from us,” Kejriwal added.

When asked why did he thank Dhoni in his letter, Kejriwal shot back, “Do you really think had it not been for his effort and conduct in the world cup, Indians would have got united in standing behind him?”

Dhankhar made the statement at Siliguri in north Bengal where he went for a day to attend a few programmes. Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with the Trinamool Congress government on multiple occasions, said at a media conference that the state’s name was associated with violence and murders associated with politics and elections.

Earlier in the day at Jalpaiguri, he said, “In the past 15-20 days, my rapport with the state government has picked up. I think, now, we are in the proper take-off stage.”

Later, he took a jibe at state politics, saying: “In last many years, West Bengal’s name has been associated with political and election violence and political murders. These things should come to an end. I believe all are trying to bring this to an end.” He said bureaucrats and policemen should act neutrally.

“It is a constructive suggestion. Our image in the entire country should be of the nature that we will have the most peaceful elections,” he told reporters in Siliguri. Dhankhar’s statement comes at a time when preparations are being made for the civic polls. The assembly polls will be held in 2021.

Education minister Partha Chatterjee, who held a meeting with Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan on Thursday, said: “He said what he wanted to. We don’t want to react on his statements every day.”",Politics of violence must end: Jagdeep Dhankhar,1576,2.284263959

It wasn’t totally surprising that playing a World Cup final in front of over 86,000 people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground left India overwhelmed against the formidable Australia on Sunday. Not even seasoned cricketers are immune to stage fright, let alone this young Indian women’s cricket team.

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led outfit was the youngest of all teams at the Women’s T20 World Cup with 10 of the 15 players in the squad aged 23 or under. The average age of India’s playing eleven in the final was 23.9, which included three teenagers without counting 16-year-old Richa Ghosh, who came on as a concussion substitute. The Australian team’s average age was 26.4 with 20-year-old Georgia Wareham the youngest member of the eleven.

However, one major factor that cost India the final, inexperience, also gives the biggest hope for this current band of women that it can turn into a formidable force over the next four-five years, a group that would have learnt valuable lessons from this tournament and developed further in skills and mindset.

“Definitely, I see India lifting an ICC trophy over the next few years,” Sulakshana Naik, former India woman cricketer (46 ODIs, 31 T20s, two Tests), said. “These young girls have shown they have enough potential and with some more experience they will be there. We just need to stay patient, invest fully in them and give them time to grow.”

That process of investment, Naik and former India women’s team coach Tushar Arothe say, involves playing as many international matches as possible against top sides like Australia and England, home and away. The more the likes of Shafali Verma (16), Jemimah Rodrigues, Radha Yadav (both 19), Taniya Bhatia (22) and Ghosh do that, the more they will fine-tune their game and learn to bat under pressure in crunch games.

“These youngsters need to be playing competitive cricket constantly against tough teams to boost and upgrade their skill level,” Arothe said.

“It will also help them get rid of the inferiority complex. If they keep playing sides like Australia, they will not feel daunted when they play big matches. They will learn a lot of things, not just in batting and bowling but also mindset and how to manage pressure.”

Biju George, former fielding coach of the women’s team, reckoned there has been a radical improvement in the team since 2017 and that there is no reason why the progress can’t be maintained. “Earlier, we used to play well only at home, but now we have started to win matches even in Australia, England and New Zealand. That has been a big difference,” he said.

Another factor that could prove decisive is not tinkering with the natural flair of the young brigade. Shafali, for example, can be taught to adapt as per the situation, but the foundation of her game—which is to play attacking shots—might be best left untouched.

“The likes of Shafali, Jemimah, Richa, etc., they’re there because of their talent and people are looking at them as the future of Indian cricket. I would not want to change somebody’s natural talent. Today, Shafali can hit the first ball for six. Maybe two years down the line, she will be watchful initially when the ball is doing something. So, her temperament will improve, and that will only come with experience and maturity,” Naik, a former wicketkeeper-batsman, said.

One aspect that needs lot of attention going forward is strength conditioning, said Arothe. “Overall, fitness and agility needs to improve, and that is up to each individual. Teams like Australia, England and West Indies play on power. Our technique and natural talent is way superior to them, but they compensate it with their power. We need to work on that to become world beaters,” he said.

He is confident this young team can wear the tag of world beaters in a few years, be it in the 20-overs or 50-overs formats. “This team has the potential to win a World Cup. The ingredients are all there. They need to be positive and work hard towards it.”",Women’s T20 World Cup: Helping young talent emerge from pain of loss,4023,2.734277902
3053,0,"The intense cold wave sweeping over the Indo-Gangetic plains has now taken its toll on a high profile denizen of the national capital, none other than the irrepressible and inimitable Digvijaya Singh. The veteran congress leaders apparently attempted to put his foot into his mouth in the wee morning hours, when the mercury level was hovering around zeo degrees, resulting in severe frostbite and freezing of his mouth. Diggy has been admitted to the ‘foot in the mouth’ VIP section of AIMS and is expected to recover soon.

Shedding light on the incident, an aide said, “Diggy sir has been under intense pressure of late, what with even small time leaders such as Sanjay Nirupam and Vijayvrgiya stealing the spotlight from him with their misogynistic statements and making front page news. The latest gaffe from Asaram Bapu was the last straw, driving Diggy sir to desperate measures to get back into the news, resulting in this unfortunate calamity.”

It indeed has been a difficult year for Diggy with leaders from both his party and the BJP beating him at his own game of dumbing down the discourse. Even his last intervention, claiming BJP had bought off Muslim voters, did not yield the coverage it deserved, as news editors had far more interesting and titillating material on their plate.

However, Diggy has no regrets about his latest misadventure. “It’s a matter of satisfaction that I at least made it to the front page of The Unreal Times. Even you guys have stopped devoting space to me,” he told us in an emotionally charged voice when The Unreal Times team called on him to wish him a speedy recovery.

We in turn thanked him for motivating us to write this baseless and pointless article and assured him that we’ll never cease covering him, especially on days when there is nothing newsy happening and we are starved for themes.

3054,0,"Barely has the raging controversy over “Udta Punjab” died down, hotshot director Anurag Kashyap has already announced his next movie titled “Girta Punjab”. As is self-explanatory, the movie will be a biopic of sorts, based on the tragic fall of the IPL team Kings XI Punjab.

“The movie spans from 2007, right from the first season of the IPL until present time. Right from the time it was under Yuvraj Singh to the present day. The best part about the movie is that it can be as close to reality as possible. For the first time in her career, Priety Zinta can get to play her own self on screen. Not that she has any other movies to do anyway. Same thing with Brett Lee. Having already had some Bollywood experience with the massive disaster called.. er.. Victory in 2009, Brett will be an asset. I also look forward to having him sing duets with Asha tai again, for Girta Punjab,” an excited Kashyap exclaimed.

Bollywood pundits anticipate the movie to be yet another addition to the library of classic Bollywood tragedies. “Many felt that Priety’s biggest disaster was Ishkq in Paris, but given the way KXIP has been playing over the last few seasons, their answers are now different. And given how KXIP sunk even further than IIP’s box office collections, it is definitely a tragedy that needs to be told on celluloid,” remarked trade analyst Taran Adarsh, the lone man to give a 4.5 star rating for Ishkq in Paris.

“Another real-life casting coup would be roping in Sreesanth, who is now doing absolutely everything other than playing cricket. His on-screen emotions after having received a tight slap from Bhajji were just so moving that only he alone can do justice to them in this film. Although all my films are known to be dark thrillers, I’d like some comic relief every now and then in this one. And who better than Sreechettan, with all his antics?! He’ll fit the bill to a T,” Kashyap added.

If the inception of Girta Punjab is anything to go by, it should ideally be free of the hardships suffered by its antonym predecessor. BJP MP, brash commentator, perennial laugher and well, former Indian cricketer, Navjot Singh Sidhu, has offered to be the narrator of the movie for all of 1 Rupee. When Kashyap mockingly mentioned that he could as well do it free of cost instead of taking just 1 Rupee, Sherry paaji, as he is known, apparently retorted that the only thing in life one got for free was dandruff.

CBFC Chief Pahlaj Nihalani, meanwhile, has already set his eyes on the film. “It’s bad and painful enough to watch KXIP as it is, for 2 months every year. And now, with a movie also based on it, it’ll just be too much to handle. I’m banning this movie in advance right-away,” Nihalani announced.","Anurag Kashyap announces next movie “Girta Punjab”, based on Kings XI Punjab’s story",2719,2.464141228

3056,0,"Congress leader Digvijay Singh is all set to be the third male participant in the fifth season of Bigg Boss after Shakti Kapoor and television star Amar Upadhyay. “People perceive me, somewhat unfairly, as a bullshitter and a mean bully who gets on the wrong side of all the good people. Through Bigg Boss, I hope to show people my sensitive and vulnerable side and set right the misleading impression created by right-wing media,” said Digvijay Singh. Diggy denied suggestions that he hoped to revive his dwindling political career through a stint in the reality show.

The veteran leader is expected to stir things up in the house and raise the heat between the inmates up by several notches. According to the organizers, at one stage in the show, Diggy will pick up an argument with Pooja Bedi, which will escalate into a full fledged fight. At a climactic moment in the altercation, Diggy will categorically label her an RSS agent, after which a shocked Pooja will then ask Diggy to shut the <beep> up. Diggy will also court controversy by giving a clean chit to a jailed Mandeep Belvi.

However, not all of Diggy’s moments are expected to be characteristically provocative. Diggy, true to his promise, will display his sensitive side as well. Sources have hinted that Diggy and Shakti Kapoor will become fast friends, and Diggy will share several secrets with Shakti. In one of the episodes, Diggy will actually break down while speaking to Shakti Kapoor about a traumatic incident from his childhood, where a kid in khaki shorts, presumably from a nearby RSS shaka camp, slapped Diggy around, snatched his tiffin box and ate all his food.

Viewers can also look forward to a mushy, emotional moment when Diggy will speak about his love for Rahul Gandhi. In a scene likely to induce teary-eyed smiles, Diggy will vividly describe how he gingerly let go off Rahul’s bicycle the first time he learnt to ride it on his own; how he taught him out-swing bowling after which Rahul went on to take five wickets in a school game; and how he helped Rahul dress up for his first date.

When The UnReal Times rang up Anna Hazare for his reaction on this development, Anna laughed for a full 30 seconds before saying “When I said that Digvijay should go to a mental asylum, I was just kidding. Can’t believe he actually took my advice.” When asked if he would accept Diggy’s challenge and take him on by entering the Bigg Boss house, Anna said he would consider it if the inmates of the house state in writing that they support the Jan Lokpal bill.",Digvijay Singh to enter Bigg Boss’ house,2541,1.849665486
3057,0,"New Delhi. After receiving a lot of criticism for inducting Babu Singh Kushwaha, accused of corruption in a multi-crore rural health scam in Uttar Pradesh, BJP has decided to rebrand and reposition itself to get back the lost support among critics and masses.

In a move that looks clearly inspired from the television entertainment channel Star One, which was re-launched as “Life OK” a few weeks back, BJP has decided to call itself “Party OK”. The new name will be launched on the eve of Uttar Pradesh elections.

“Our candidates will contest elections on the BJP symbol only, and even the ballot papers will mention our party’s name as ‘BJP’, but we’ll call ourselves ‘Party OK’ during all public meets,” BJP President Nitin Gadkari declared.

Sources inform that through this attempt, the party has made its positioning more real and practical from the earlier positioning of “party with a difference”.

Management consultants claim that the new logo will change the fortunes of the party

“That positioning raised false hopes among many supporters who thought the party will not indulge in petty politics for immediate electoral gains,” a party source said, “That’s why we are now calling ourselves ‘Party OK’, so that people know that we just about OK.”

“A party that is just good enough,” the source added.

It’s not yet clear how much money BJP is spending on this whole rebranding exercise, but sources inform that the party had hired leading brand professionals from the industry, who suggested that BJP started calling itself “Party OK”.

“They have also prepared a document on how to lead the fight against corruption,” a party source said, “The document uses some of the key strategies adopted by US in its war against terror, where it invaded many nations for world peace.”

Most of the party leaders and workers have welcomed the decision and have called it “timely”.

“It was much needed,” a party leader told Faking News on conditions of anonymity, “Look what happened to Team Anna. They positioned themselves as messiah against corruption and hence when minor irregularities like inflated travel bills of Kiran Bedi came to light, it hurt them.”

“Same with Sachin Tendulkar,” the party leader further explained, “The positioning as ‘god’ is hurting him. People think he has failed even if he scores a half century in each innings. We must learn from these.”

Party insiders say that the move will not only justify admission of leaders like Kushwaha, but it will also help the party in reinstating leaders like BS Yeddyurappa, the former Chief Minister of Karnataka who had to resign after a state Lokayukta report indicted him in mining scam.

“Yeddy had asked for a suitable post in BJP recently for his homecoming, he could be made in-charge of this rebranding process,” a party insider said.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said the PSL matches in Karachi will go ahead as per schedule despite the increase in number of positive novel coronavirus cases in the city.

The Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches are scheduled to be played in Karachi from March 12 to 17.

The Sindh government has confirmed that the total number of positive coronavirus cases in the province had jumped to 15, raising concerns about the spread of the disease. But the country’s national board said it has held constructive discussions with the provincial government and the two will work closely to ensure safety and health of the spectators.

“As it is always the case, the PCB is guided by the Sindh government in such matters. In this background, we are satisfied with the feedback the Sindh government has provided and the support it has assured,” the PCB said in a statement.

“At the same time, the PCB has promised the Sindh government that it will work very closely with its commercial partner and support wherever it can to assist in the health and safety of the spectators.” The PCB also urged the people to throng the National Stadium to watch the matches.

A number of directives have been issued to the spectators to ensure safety from the coronavirus which includes refraining from hugging or shaking hands, using soap and sanitizers inside the enclosure.

The PCB has also set up a temporary hospital at its high performance centre to deal with any cases with space for isolation of patients.

Schools and colleges have been shut down by the Sindh government till March 13 and a spokesman said a decision to extend the closure will be taken by Thursday.",PSL matches in Karachi to go ahead as per schedule: PCB,1710,1.403508772

She has had a long career in the US and Canada featuring in films and videos that are not recommended for family audience. Over the last 5 years, she has acted in modern classics like Jism 2, Ragini MMS 2 and Kuch Kuch Locha hai.

Considering the fact that she has made a successful career of portraying the object across a decade, why is she speaking out against the same concept?

Talking to our correspondent in a freewheeling chat, Sunny admitted that she has made a career from acting in explicit films. She understands that it is her chosen profession and is not unhappy with that. At the same time, she says, she was inspired by Congress leaders acting as if they are totally disowning their past.

“Consider this,” she says.

“Robert Vadra goes around in suit, boot and much more. Sometimes even the choice of color is bizarre. Radia tapes have Mukesh Ambani saying ‘Haan, yaar, ab Congress mera dukaan hai’ [Yes, Congress is also now my shop]. But, Rahul Gandhi now says the Government is suited and booted!”

“Another example,” she adds. “Kamal Nath rolled out the infamous SEZ schemes that basically converted farmland around cities into offices. Farmers got a token amount while real estate companies minted money. The same Kamal Nath now says that the Modi Government is not doing enough for farmers!”

“Take A.K. Antony, the man whose decision making skills made Narasimha Rao look like Usain Bolt on steroids. Now, A.K. Antony says that the NDA defense ministry has lost a year and Rafale deal should not have been done! Antony!” she says incredulously.

“One by one Congressmen are making these statements. And not only is our mainstream media reporting it verbatim, they are also publicizing it through their tweets and TV programs. Not one of them even bothered to question Kamal Nath or Antony or Rahul Gandhi on the incongruousness of these statements,” she added. “Now I can’t wait to see A. Raja talk about corruption or Dr. Singh say that the PM should talk more!”

“By the way,” she asked us, “why are you asking me all this? Which media you are from?”

We said we are from The UnReal Times and were worried that she would start acting in character roles. Sunny laughed and said that it was just an experiment, and absently began to check her Twitter feed…

The offer was made when Mayawati was casually chatting with the United States ambassador to India, Timothy Reiner, at a luncheon hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his residence in July 2009 in honor of visiting Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to the cable.

According to the cable, Mayawati evinced keen interest in France having gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1896 as a monument to mark the American war of independence.

To the shock of the envoy, she disclosed that the government of Uttar Pradesh was working on a “Statue of Mayawati” of similar size and dimension, which was to be gifted to the United States on behalf of the people of Uttar Pradesh to foster warm and friendly ties between the world’s most powerful democracy and the world’s largest democratic state within a state.

Timothy further reveals that the BSP supremo had expressed an ardent desire to install the “Statue of Mayawati”, adorned with a garland of dollar bills and 1000 rupee notes to symbolize prosperity, right next to the Statue of Liberty in New York’s Liberty Island.

The American envoy said that was easily the most difficult diplomatic situation he had faced in his entire career and that he had to fall back upon the experience of his entire career to wriggle out of the delicate situation without hurting Mayawati’s feelings.

Mayawati has rubbished the disclosures and called Timothy deluded. “People know my tastes better.

3064,0,"So everyone hit the roof when a certain (in)sensitive remark was made by actor Salman Khan about his grueling schedule in his forthcoming movie “Sultan”. His father Salim Khan quickly issued an apology sending out a message to the likes of Messrs. Arnab Goswami and his ilk that no one wanted to appear on their cacophonic debates. What irked the electronic and social media was that Bollywood has chosen to maintain prudent silence on the issue. But the truth is…. considering Salman has a not-so-impeccable record in his relationships with women, the fact that he could actually identify with a traumatised woman left the film fraternity speechless.

Among the current crop of actresses only Kangana Ranaut ventured to say that the thought process (behind the remark) was faulty but pointed out that no fingers were to be pointed. And then Renuka Shahane tweeted that there is consent given by actors when they accept a certain role…..

This is why NCW chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam took suo motu cognizance of the remarks and issued a summons to the actor in connection with the remarks.

“Yes, we empathise with him. You see, so many times in the case of women, even the courts say that there was a consensual relationship. We are therefore seeking a clarification from him,” she confirmed. “We would also like him to consider a cameo in a short ad-film that deals with sexual abuse called ‘Start with the men,’ “she said.

When asked whether such remarks reflected the mindset of the person, she offered no direct comment but said that the average Bollywood mindset in making movies was somewhat like a string quartet – too violent, a violation and a Chammak challo.

In Bollywood, several felt Ms. Kumaramangalam had made an important point and that Khan needed to be praised for his dedication and defended for his plainspeak. For Nawazuddin Siddiqui the “intent” was not wrong. Director Subhash Ghai who had said that Salman was a child rued the fact that only negative minds could cruelly misinterpret the remark that was made with child-like innocence and with no intention to outrage.

“We are thinking of making a movie called “What women don’t want” and now I can visualise Salman in the leading role. See how well he identifies with it …. Kamal Haasan or Ravi Kishen have merely dressed as women for their respective roles, Salman would be living the role even off-camera….he is perfect.”

Many concurred with the veteran film maker and agreed that Salman was merely connecting with his feminine self.

At the end of the day, although Anurag Kashyap averred that it was a stupid thing to say, the film fraternity decided that Sallu’s image could not be sullied.

3066,0,"After two consecutive massive, match-altering last-wicket partnerships between India’s Bhuvaneshwar Kumar-Mohammad Shami and England’s Joe Root-James Anderson tested the patience of the limited audience that watches Test cricket, the ICC has decided to do away with last-wicket partnerships for the remainder of the ongoing India-England series, on an experimental basis. The number of runs for the last wicket partnership will be decided by the Duckworth-Lewis method.

“Aamaa paa, these last wicket partnerships will kill Test cricket. It is ok if the Indian tail wags once in a while. That Test cricket lovers don’t mind since most of them are Indians and it allows them to mouth platitudes like ‘that’s what makes Test cricket so exciting’. But when the England last wicket pair repeats the act, viewers lose interest, paa,” ICC Chairman N Srinivasan told The UnReal Times.

Since making more bowler friendly pitches along with DRS is a no-go area, Srinivasan’s proposal found resonance with bowlers in both the teams. “Come on, yaar. You bat for half a day and then realize you’ll have to bowl long spells immediately after that. We’re workhorses, not machines. Srini mama’s idea is very good and I hope it is implemented soon. It’s one thing if you have to bat for hours like Dravid and then have to bowl like Venkatesh Prasad. I can do that aaraam se, but to bat like Dravid and then bowl like me is just too tough on me,” India’s Mohammad Shami told The UnReal Times.

Anderson seconded Shami’s stand. “I was beginning to feel like Ishant towards the end of my spell after Bhuvi belted me to cow’s corner repeatedly. I tried to make up for it by tonking a few myself today but the psychological damage is done,” the English pacer wailed.

Sources, however, added that the phenomenon could repeat with the likelihood of record eighth-wicket partnerships too. “If it happens regularly, we will invert the line-ups of both teams, so that bowlers get to open the innings and batsmen get to bat last,” Srinivasan said.","ICC to ban last-wicket partnerships in Ind-Eng series, to use D/L method to decide partnership runs",2021,2.27610094

It is a question of the country's integrity.""He said that ""they (Congress) create problems like Article 370 and 35(A)"" by their ""vote bank politics"", and ""we solve them"" to strengthen India.Verma said Lord Rama gives the message of humanity but the Congress linked him with religion, and went on to add that ""if opposition members chant 'Jai Shri Ram', their sins will be washed off"".The BJP MP said his government was not of any particular religion.Verma also accused the Congress of removing the pictures of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Hanuman from the original copy of the Constitution and added that these pictures were ""not related to religion"".He said that if his government talks about Ram Mandir, it also talks about toilets.Stressing that a strong foundation would be laid by the present government during its tenure, Verma said that in three years India will become an economic power, while the Opposition Congress will shrink.The Constitution, he said, was of foremost importance and asked the Congress ""where was the Constitution when riots took place in 1984.""Padma awards were given during the Congress rule ""on recommendation. In contrast, they are given on merit under the BJP government,"" Verma said.The West Delhi MP also attacked the Congress over the policies followed by it when the party was in power in Delhi.He said that while it was the Congress government which created problems like unauthorised colonies, the BJP government has worked to solve them.Verma also said that if the BJP comes to power in Delhi, it will ensure that 'pucca' houses will be built in unauthorised colonies.He also targeted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), saying it had said that the number of buses will increase, but in reality the number of DTC buses has gone down in Delhi.He also said that Delhi has been alloted the maximum share from Nirbhaya fund but the money remains unutilised.""Delhi Government is giving Rs 18,000 salary to Imam... but has forgotten the priests of temples and gurudwaras,"" he said.Verma also referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, rather people there are saying ""Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.""The BJP leader also hit out at those who questioned surgical strike by India on terror camps in Pakistan.Earlier, opposition members, including those from the Congress and DMK, walked out of Lok Sabha to protest Verma's controversial remarks during a poll rally, when the BJP MP rose to initiate the debate.The TMC said that Verma's speech was for Delhi election campaign and not for debate on the President's address.

“We support free speech in our country and we will always stand by the people who endorse our brands.

Therefore, we have requested our ambassadors to ignore Meryl Streep’s speech lest they get an idea to make a similar speech during the current awards season”, General Manager of an auto manufacturer said.

CEO of a startup, FeelDeal said ,”We pay a lot of money to our brand ambassadors and in return, we expect certain things from them. Firstly, they must never get married.

Mr. Pawar also revealed how he always fancied being an actor before joining politics. “Not many people know that I was associated with Marathi theater in the early years of my life. I even auditioned for the role of Vijay in Deewar, which later went to Amitabh Bachchan. I realized later politics is no different from bollywood, as in both need good acting skills. So I decided to try my luck in politics,” he said.

Sources say that the NCP Chief is already in talks with director Rajkumar Hirani. It is not yet clear who would portray the politician on the big screen. A few names are being thrown around, but it seems Sharad Pawar is keen on Akshay Kumar to play the role.

“Akshay is a great actor and he has done a lot of patriotic movies in the last decade. So he is a natural choice to essay the social work done by Saheb,” remarked a spkesperson for NCP.

The bollywood actor however denied having any knowledge of Mr. Pawar’s biopic and said that already has his hands full with other patriotic projects for the next 10 years.","Sanjay Dutt went to jail and Bollywood made a movie on him, I want to go to jail too: Sharad Pawar",1450,1.931034483

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless.

There have been a lot of reports going on about the shadow cast by the virus on the future of the tournament but Patel said that necessary precautions will be taken during the tournament.

“Why will COVID-19 attack only IPL? We are monitoring the situation. All cricket matches, be it Ranji Trophy final, or series between Afghanistan and Ireland, England and Sri Lanka and Australia-New Zealand are currently going ahead as per schedule. The Road Safety World Series is on. These matches have seen full houses at the stadium in Mumbai. Local trains are running, schools and colleges are not totally shut,” Patel told The Week.

Its a very unique feat achieved by UP government and Akhilesh government should be given full credit for this achievement. BCCI was quick to recognize and also award Akhilesh government. BCCI has hired Akhilesh as cheif pitch curator. The reason behind this is that BCCI wants to create bouncy pitches in India.

Akhilesh Yadav laughing after Raina requested for a meeting following this news

UP government showed its good intentions by announcing compensation to farmers who are effected by untimely rains. The government followed up by issuing cheques worth 2o crores to farmers but when farmers tried to cash them, most of the cheques bounced and this has incurred fines worth 25 crores on the government.One organization with a keen sense for talent reacted swiftly to this incident and hired Akhilesh Yadav immediately.We talked to BCCI chief Daal-mein Kala-Miya about this.

Kekdekar : Sir, You could have hired Vijay Malya. He also has a strong resume.

Daal-mein Kala-Miya : Well, very valid question. Vijay Malyas cheque bounces only when his Airlines employees try to cash it and that number is very small. When you compare that to what Akhilesh has achieved, Vijay Malya does not stand a chance.

Kekdekar : What are the other qualities that impressed you ?

Daal-mein Kala-miya : His government issued cheques for amounts such as 73 rupees , 150 rupess, 750 rupees and so on. Even many of those cheques bounced. This is what has impressed me the most.

Kekdekar : So what is your plan ?

Daal-mein Kala-Miya : Many teams in the WorldCup( IPL ) have good fast bowlers. They are complaining that we don’t have bouncy wickets. With Akhilesh as chief curator, by next WorldCup (IPL -9 ) we will have a wicket that will have more bounce that Perth.

A deeper look into the matter revealed that the passengers who had cancelled and re-booked the tickets were all failed students, who are to face their arrears very soon. When a couple of these students were contacted and asked as to why they had done so, they replied that they were on their way to Kodaikkanal to seek the blessings of BCCI president and Chennai Super Kings franchise owner N.Srinivasan (who is currently there) and thereby, as they strongly believe, seek immunity from failing.

B.E. Bhaskaran, an engineering student from Coimbatore, who has failed for 4 years in a row, said, “I already have B.E in my name, saar! Why should I do degree to get it?”, accompanied by peals of laughter, before he continued, “Saar, every year my paati tells me I should pray to Lord Balaji saar. I prayed to Lakshmipathy Balaji, nothing happened saar. Then my paati scolded me and told me to go to Tirupati and pray over there. But still I failed wonly saar. After seeing today’s IPL match, I decided that I have to pray to Lord Srinivasan, saar. That’s why I’m going to Kodai right away!”

With Brazilian football players and fans crying and sobbing inconsolably after Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semi-final, experts have warned of a possible mass depression across the country. Therefore as a precautionary step, Brazil government has requested Rahul Gandhi to come and teach Brazilians how to smile in such adverse times.

Name of Rahul Gandhi was suggested by a member of Brazilian Embassy in Delhi, who had earlier witnessed Congress Vice President smiling at the press conference after Congress was defeated in a similar manner on 16th of May.

Because winning and losing are just states of mind.

“We urgently needed some help, as our efforts to control mass mourning have failed. The level of shock is so high that Brazilians are not in a condition to work or do anything for at least a month, which could be very harmful for not only for our economy, but for people too. We want them to recover as fast as possible, and we believe that Shri Rahul Gandhi would help us out,” hope Brazilian Ambassador to India, Mr Carlos Sergio.

Buoyed by the faith Brazil government has shown in him, Rahul Gandhi has immediately accepted the offer and is reported to be on his way to Rio de Janeiro.

“He anyway loves going abroad,” a source confirmed to Faking News.

Before leaving India, in a short message to his party members and his die-hard fans, Rahul reiterated his core ideology of serving poor and marginalized people. He further claimed that Congress will help poor people in all developing economies, whether India or Brazil. He also promised RTI and Women Empowerment for Brazil.

Meanwhile Brazil government has started the groundwork. They are promoting Rahul Gandhi’s arrival as arrival of a saint from east.

“As soon as he lands, he will address a massive rally in the capital and explain to Brazilians that victory or loss was just a state of mind,” a source disclosed.

“He will tour across Brazil and will be addressing gatherings in different cities, recounting stories of those times when Brazil won the world cup and defeated Germany in different matches,” the source further revealed Rahul’s grand plan for Brazilian revival.

One official who spoke to Faking News said, “It didn’t look like the match was being played in New Zealand. It could have easily been mistaken for Wankhede. And this is not the first time that we have seen support. Though we are an immigrant friendly country. But we do need to know how many naturally born New Zealander’s are there in the country. It is also important for sporting events where teams morale is low.”

“In fact the Indian captain Virat Kohli too admitted that crowd support definitely affected their performance and that validated their concern,” he added.

However, despite her best efforts, it appears that the BJP might come to power and she could be staring at a long winter in power.

Of late, Sushma has been giving even AAP leaders a run for their money with her vocal, sanctimonious opposition to the entry of tainted leaders into the saffron camp:

I want to make it absolutely clear that B.Sriramulu has been admitted in the party despite my stiff opposition. — Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwarajbjp) March 14, 2014

And this after she herself was alleged to have been the matron saint to the infamous Reddy brothers, a U turn of Kejriwalesque proportions:

Swaraj’s bid to continue as leader of opposition got a shot in the arm after Sonia Gandhi endorsed her in glowing terms. “Chinamma and I have established a close working relationship, our past differences notwithstanding,” Sonia wrote in her letter of recommendation to Rajnath Singh. “I am especially grateful to her for pushing through the Telangana bill without any discussion on the floor of the House. Despite her being a BJP member, I am fully confident that she will do a fine job in highlighting the deficiencies of the Modi led NDA government, perhaps much better than even we can. Anyway, Rahul baba will be taking off on a looooong vacation after the elections and as far as we are concerned, Chinamma will be our leader in the next Lok Sabha.”

With Sushma adamant that she won’t take up a ministry and will prefer sitting in the Opposition benches, the BJP leadership has reconciled itself to the inevitable. “We have told Modiji to brush up on his sher-shayari and some economics gobbledygook on price rise by way of preparing for verbal jousts with Sushmaji on the floor of the House,” BJP president Rajnath Singh told The UnReal Times.",Sushma Swaraj expresses desire to continue as Leader of Opposition even if NDA comes to power,2055,1.605839416

Speaking to The UnReal Times, Salman Khan said, “I was really touched by the message Mr. Padukone’s letter conveyed. It evoked a lot of emotion and everyone present there had tears in their eyes. Since then I decided do something similar. Even I want to bring tears in everyone’s eyes.”

“But you have already achieved that with your movie Prem Ratan Dhan Payo…I mean, Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Even Aamir Khan was seen wiping his eyes when he came out of the theater after watching the movie,” we said.

“Yes and then he watched his nephew’s movie and cried,” said Bhai, making a face. “But I want to see tears in bulk and I want to cry with them as well. See, I broke down when the court verdict was announced but no one saw that. I want to enact the whole process all over again on the stage where I will read out the verdict and then I will break down in tears. I am sure there will be many crying with me.”

“Of course, people love you. Moreover, there are quite a few out-of-work actors banking on you to re-launch them,” we concurred.

“No but the verdict was quite emotional for me. It was like the letter Deepika’s dad wrote to her. Let me read it out for you guys. Please bear with me for two minutes – ‘Dear Salman, You stand on the threshold of a new journey in life. When you told us that you wanted to start life afresh, we felt you were too immature and too inexperienced to be driving alone in a big city full of pavement dwellers, and on the roads you knew nothing about. But in the end we decided to let you follow your heart.’“

“So, how is it? I can see tears in your eyes,” he looked at us with a self-assured smile.

“That’s because we walk on the pavement quite often and…”

“Now just imagine how the audience will react when I read this. Anyway, gotta go for a drive. Are you guys coming?”

Diggy has now been summoned by 10, Janpath to clarify his statement. The veteran Congress leader is keeping his fingers crossed about getting back into the good books of Congress’s first family. “Let’s see. 50-50 chance banta hai but I wouldn’t bet on it after getting egg on my face for my UP poll predictions,” said a nervous Diggy.

Diggy’s statement has left Salman Khurshid devastated. “Damn, why didn’t I think of that statement and issue it before he did. Now he’s gonna rise above me in the pecking order,” confided Mr Khurshid, who’s been cogitating hard ever since to come up with a better one.

Diggy’s controversial statement however has opened a Pandora ’s Box of geo-political claims. Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba said his family also needs to be feted since Sachin had scored his 34th ODI against a Namibian international cricket team in a WC match. “My great-grandpa, Jingi Mombasa, worked his ass off to secure Namibia’s independence, man, and more importantly, we occasionally qualify for the World Cup. I hope IPL franchisees take a few Namibian players as a token of appreciation,” said Mr Pohamba.

Nita Ambani, owner of Mumbai Indians, has promised to look into it. “Anything for Sachin, yaa. I have told Mukesh to buy out the entire country if any visa issues arise,” cooed Nita.

UK Prime Minister, David Cameroon, also jumped into the queue to take credit. “Hey, don’t forget our little contribution to Sachin’s magnificent record by carving cricket playing countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe out of the British empire,” said Mr Cameroon, who however apologized for his country not doing enough to popularize cricket in Burma, another erstwhile British colony.

In related news, a diehard Sachin fan, Atul Kasbekar, has filed a case of blasphemy against his IT co-worker, Sujit Nair, for callously remarking that Sachin’s ton cost India the match. “What a sick statement, yaar. It has hurt my religious sentiments,” said Atul, eyes welling up with tears. Justice Shergaonkar of the Mumbai High Court has taken cognizance of the FIR and will commence hearings into the case shortly. “Prima facie, it seems to be a hate statement. How can you indirectly blame Sachin for India’s loss, yaar? Freedom of speech does not mean freedom to offend, ok. WTF,” caustically observed the Judge, whose BP reportedly shot up after reading Nair’s controversial statement.

Pakistan captain, Misbah-ul-Haq, is also despondent that Sachin did not score his 100th 100 against Pakistan. “I was soo looking forward to Sachin scoring it against us, and not Bangladesh. Our statistician, Haqeeqat Ahmed Abbasi, tells us that a Sachin century reduces India’s chances of victory by 20%,” sniffed Misbah, a tear streaming down his cheeks.

“Don’t cry, Misbah bhai. According to my daughter, Bangladesh was once called East Pakistan if that is of any consolation to you,” noted Shahid Afridi. Misbah now began sobbing uncontrollably.

With Kanimozhi, MK Stalin and Dayanidhi Maran courting arrest at various jails in the city, the news has spread like wildfire, with prominent areas of Chennai trending on Twitter. The already on-fire protest has now received a nitro-boost with the Kalaignar himself joining the agitation from the quarters of his own residence. “Others have gone on-site paa, I will work from home by courting house arrest, paa!” proclaimed a smiling Karunanidhi, clearly proving that despite being an octogenarian, he is in sync with the IT generation.

Throwing more light on his protest, the Kalaignar continued in Tamil, saying, “I will not step out of my house at all today. Everyday I step out to the balcony to breathe in some fresh air, expose my cooling glasses to some sunshine so that they feel useful, watch the birds flying in the sky and write some poems paa. But today, as a part of my protest, I will not do even that. I will sit within the confines of my house reflect on the 2G scam and probably write one about it.”

Commenting on the DMK’s protest, Janata Party president Dr.Subramanian Swamy said, “It’s good that they’ve decided to check them (jails) out and have a trial run. I’ll anyways be sending them to Tihar soon. By the looks of it, Kani’s missing Tihar already.”

3087,0,"The AAP movement got a major boost after Reliance Group chairman, Anil Ambani, joined the fledgling anti-corruption party, citing ideological compatibility, especially when it comes to taking on trillionaire tycoons.

Arvind initiated Anil into the AAP fold in the traditional manner by placing the AAP topi, emblazoned with the caption “Main hoon aam billionaire,” over his head in the presence of Manish Sisodiya, Prashant Bhushan and the Ashutosh. Arvind went on to praise Anil, saying he’s just another run of the mill billionaire without any aukaat, who, just like the proverbial aam aadmi, has been fleeced by Mukesh Ambani.

There had been some initial resistance to admitting the younger Ambani since AAP had been occasionally targeting him also, most recently by mentioning his name in the list of alleged black money holders in a letter to the SIT. Some other AAP leaders also aired misgivings about Modi inviting Anil to join the Swachch Abhiyaan initiative.

However, Anil managed to win over the skeptics by pointing out that he had been opposing Mukesh Ambani even before AAP made it cool to do so. “Unlike you guys, I have been opposing Mukesh since my childhood,” Anil said in his impassioned defense, recalling anecdotes from childhood to present of how Mukesh greedily grabbed the lion’s share of the goodies, from dhoklas prepared by Kokila ben to Reliance assets.

He also managed to win sympathy by pointing out that PM Modi has never tweeted what Tina thinks, nor posed obsequiously with her and him. “Mukesh always walks away with the top honours. Nita owns Mumbai Indians, Tina can just about afford a franchise in the Indian Kabbadi League. My own villa is not even half as imposingly ugly as Antilla. I rest my case,” Anil told the AAP induction committee and swayed the decision in his favour. Anil will now head the “exposing agents of Mukesh Ambani” cell in AAP.

Arvind Kejriwal said he will now write a letter to Kokila ben, chiding her for the inequitable distribution of Reliance assets between Mukesh and Anil. Mukesh Ambani shot back, calling Arvind Kejriwal an Anil Ambani agent.","Anil Ambani joins AAP, says wants to do his bit to expose Mukesh Ambani",2115,1.796690307

This time he was joined by ‘younger brother’ Kanhaiya as the duo took on Modi and his henchmen in a no-holds barred attack.

“Modi ji, how long will you harass Sonia ji over UPA scams? Get a life and move on, man. We are here now. Fight us instead and leave poor Sonia ji alone,” Kejriwal and Kanhaiya jointly hissed at the press conference. “For too long, you and your goons have been having a field day, bullying an aging woman, clearly past her prime. Well, not anymore. Modi ji and Jaitley ji, your days are numbered,” the dynamic duo warned.

Later, Kejriwal visited 10, Janpath to console a distressed Sonia and introduce her to Kanhaiya. “I assured her that she is not alone anymore. Rahul baba may be a flop but his place can be taken by Kanhaiya. Together we will free mother India from this oppressive regime. I told her not to get stressed by the Modi regime’s dirty tricks department. Modi keeps getting kicked by us and to vent his frustration, he goes after Sonia ji,” Kejriwal disclosed of the historic and melodramatic reunion. Wiping away tears of joy, a relived Sonia exclaimed ‘mere Karan Arjun aa gaye’ and lovingly embraced her ‘sons’ to the mellifluous tunes of ‘yeh bandhan to pyar ka bandhan hai’ from Rakesh Roshan blockbuster Karan-Arjun playing in the background.

On the rise of Kanhaiya, the Delhi CM said he couldn’t be more excited. “He is amateurish at times but then he is only in his twenties,” Kejriwal said. “I told him that bigger challenges than strangulation attempts await him such as Ambani’s agents throwing ink at him or a CBI team trying to steal his JNU speeches. However, Kanhaiya needs to quickly settle things on the romantic front so that he is fully focused.

Pundits opine that this simple semantic reform has ensured that the PM will no longer be regarded as a political lightweight.

“That’s right, I’m the new Gandhi on the block. And to all those who cavil about my political impotence, all I have to say is just STFU,” thundered Dr. Manmohan Singh Gandhi during a media briefing to announce the change of name. The PM also insisted that his cabinet colleagues henceforth address him as Dr. Gandhi rather than Prime Minister to underscore his enhanced political credentials.

Dr. Gandhi admitted that he had faced some resistance initially from Gurcharan. “Yeah, initially she didn’t take well to my proposal and kept yelling ‘Sikhni hoon main Bhatinda ki’. But once I made her grasp the significance of being addressed as Mrs. Gandhi, she fell in line,” chuckled Dr. Manmohan Gandhi.

In keeping with his new identity as a Gandhi, and therefore a charismatic mass leader, Dr. Gandhi recently addressed a large gathering in Chak Jat village in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district. The speech was well received, reckons Panjawar Singh, the village mukhiya. “He kept making references to animal spirits which the villagers appreciated since the cows in this region have not been keeping well of late and milk yields have dropped. I must say his knowledge of animal husbandry is very good,” disclosed the mukhiya.

The change of name has left Congress workers confused, though. “Who is our leader now? Sonia Gandhi, Gurcharan Gandhi, Dr Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi? Ah well, on the bright side, at least our ardent desire of having a Gandhi as the Prime Minister of the country has been finally fulfilled,” said a party worker, eyes welling up with tears.

Dr. Manmohan Gandhi’s change of name has been welcomed by his relatives. “In addition to being the nation’s first Sikh PM, Manmohan-ji has also become the first Sikh to have a Parsi surname. He rocks,” raved Bubbly Kaur, the PM’s grand-niece.

Rahul Gandhi has also reacted positively. “Mummy informs me that so far there has never been a PhD graduate in the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.

Young pacer Akash Deep took three wickets as Bengal kept Saurashtra in check as they ended Day 1 on 206/5 in the final of the Ranji Trophy here on Monday. The home team is also fretting over Cheteshwar Pujara’s health as the India Test batsman looked under the weather before retiring hurt. Akash Deep, 23, returned the day’s best figures of 3/41 while pace spearhead Ishan Porel (1/37) and left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (1/56) picked up one wicket each. Mukesh Kumar, who was the hero of Bengal’s semifinal win over Karnataka at the Eden Gardens, remained wicketless after the first day’s play.

For Saurashtra, Avi Barot (54) and Vishvaraj Jadeja (54) struck half centuries. Arpit Vasavada remained not out on 29 from 94 deliveries with Chetan Sakariya getting dismissed off the final ball of the day.

The biggest cause of concern for the home side was Pujara, joining his state side for the final, ambling off towards the dressing room after feeling unwell late into the third session.

Pujara pushed himself down to No.6 from his usual No.3 position after Saurashtra elected to bat first. The Jaydev Unadkat-led side were 182/4 when Pujara walked out to bat and was looking solid on five from 24 balls. But as his stay at the crease progressed, the 32-year-old looked uneasy and under the weather before eventually failing to continue.

Just back from New Zealand where India lost the Test series 0-2, Pujara walked back to the dressing room looking dazed.

It was a blow for the home team who were struggling after the in-form Bengal pacers came back to take four wickets in the second and third session to blunt Saurashtra’s good start.

The opening pair of Harvik Desai (38) and wicketkeeper Barot shared a 82-run stand before Shahbaz had Desai caught at silly point by substitute Abhishek Raman.

Barot followed suit soon after with India Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, also joining the Bengal team for the final, taking a catch off Akash Deep.

Vishvaraj and Vasavada looked good for a long partnership, but Akash Deep came up with a beauty to rattle the former’s stumps.

In-form Sheldon Jackson (14) was trapped in front by Porel as Saurashtra suddenly found themselves in a spot of bother.

Pujara and Vasavada also looked good but once Pujara left the field, it was downhill for the hosts who also lost Sakariya (4) off the final ball of the day following a correct caught behind DRS review off Akash Deep’s bowling.

Saurashtra beat Gujarat in a tense semifinal to reach here while Bengal stunned Karnataka in the last-four clash. Playing their fourth final in eight seasons, Saurashtra are looking to win their maiden Ranji Trophy title, while two-time winners Bengal have not won the competition since the 1989-90 season when their head coach Arun Lal was part of the team.

Both Pujara and Saha joined Saurashtra and Bengal, respectively, following their Test assignment for India in New Zealand. India lost the two-match series 0-2. While Pujara played both the matches, Saha was dropped for Rishabh Pant.

MEanwhile, Sudeep Gharami made his first-class debut for Bengal on Monday.

Kerala police booked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president PS Sreedharan Pillai for his speech claiming credit for the Sabarimala agitation, on a day his party launched a rath yatra (chariot campaign) to protect the Lord Ayyappa temple’s traditions and rituals and the Congress announced rallies covering the entire state.

The case was registered in Kozhikode on Thursday on a complaint by journalist Shybin alleging that Pillai had recently instigated activists to protest against the entry of women of child-bearing age into the hill shrine, police said. Reacting to this, Pillai accused the CPI(M) and the Congress of ‘witch hunting’ and trying to ‘tarnish’ his image.

On September 29, the Supreme Court had allowed entry of all women into the temple, triggering protests by various groups that kept them out on October 17 when the doors were thrown open. Addressing youth leaders later, Pillai had claimed that the protests were planned and executed by his party.

On Thursday, within hours of former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa flagging off the rath yatra aimed at expanding the BJP influence in the state before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, stones were pelted in Payyanur in the evening. Immediately, the BJP called for a statewide protest on Friday. Pillai and Tushar Vellapally, leader of Bharath Dharma Jana Sena, an ally of the NDA in Kerala, are leading the ‘Sabarimala Samrakshana Rath Yatra’. The Congress too announced five rallies across the state. Five senior leaders, including K Sudhakaran and K Muralidharan, will be leading the rallies.

On Thursday, the Kerala high court rejected the bail application of Kochi resident Govind Madhusudhan, arrested in connection with the Sabarimala protests. “The protests at Sabarimala are not acceptable as it is against the verdict of the Supreme Court,” the court said. “If the bail application is considered, it will send wrong signals and similar incidents will recur.”

“Yesterday morning, I told the boys, today is a very special day. On this day, 68 years ago, Bapuji’s freedom struggle bore fruit. Subsequently, Sri Lanka also won her freedom. So we must play the best cricket of our lives on [Aug 15th]. You have sattar minute…I repeat, sattar minute. About a million Sri Lankans and a thousand million Indian fans and a handful of English geriatrics will be watching. We can’t let them down,” Matthew said, trying to do his best impersonation of SRK.

The boys also watched Lagaan, Bose: A forgotten hero, Mangal Pande: the Rising, Phir bhi Dil hai Hindustani, and a clutch of patriotic Bollywood flicks overnight to get the adrenalin flowing. It didn’t hurt either that Team India director Ravi Shatri wished the Lankan cricketers happy Independence Day at the start of the day’s play.

The pep talk, the pop patriotism immersion and the overwhelming context had had its desired effect. X-men, not middling cricketers, each imbued with whacky superpowers, turned up on August 15th: Herath was lobbing grenades waiting to explode on the faces of the hapless Indians, the Lankan close in fielders were pouching every ball like a pack of hyenas closing in on a dying water buffalo, Tharindu Kaushal seemed to have descended from another planet, a la PK, N Pradeep was bowling half as fast as Dale Steyn, and Chandimal continued haunting the Indians from behind the stumps. That’s how extraordinary they were. And for good measure, Herath channelled his inner Kachchra to mesmerise the Indians. “After bowling a lot of kachchra in the first innings, it was the least I could do,” Herath said, eyes welling up with tears.

Mathews said the boys celebrated the rest of the day in the usual manner: by watching “Gandhi” on Sony Max.","“We won it for India on her Independence Day,” reveals emotional Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews",1986,2.567975831

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

A team of 85 combining IT officials and police officers from Meerut, swooped down on Qureshi’s bungalow, and went through the former legislator’s possessions with a toothcomb.

“We were supposed to conduct this raid the very same day he made the announcement, but the police officers assisting us couldn’t immediately get time off from their buffalo guarding duties,” said an IT official.

Though the IT officials haven’t disclosed the nature of assets they found, sources reveal that a number of statues, both of Mayawati and elephants of various shapes and sizes were found. His Facebook account revealed a friend request sent to Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, and his phone revealed several SMSes sent to Aiyar presumably lauding his recent remarks. Prior to these, Qureshi had also Whatsapped UP CM Akhilesh Yadav, asking him for some good torrents to download movies and watch, sources added.

Qureshi has also found support from quite a few Indian liberals apologists, who said, “Qureshi’s statement is atrocious without doubt, but one must also look into the prevalent circumstances that are making him say such things. Also, one must also be warned about the possibility of something similar, if not much worse likely to be caused by the RSS and other communal Hindutva forces.”

3097,0,"Lucknow. Congress has come up with a master strategy for campaigning during the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections that is aimed at impressing both the rural as well as the urban voters of the state. The party has roped in television channel Star Plus to start an Uttar Pradesh edition of the cooking game show MasterChef, which will see party leader Rahul Gandhi as the star judge.

“There will be a little change in the format of the show,” Uday Shankar, a Star Plus representative told Faking News, “Instead of contestants coming to our studios, our judges will go to their homes and taste food there. They will even spend a night there if the contestants are from a particular community.”

“Contestants can cook in an environment that they are most comfortable with, and we believe this can bring out the best in them,” Uday justified the changed format of the show.

Rahul Gandhi has prior experience of eating food at homes, and that’s why the format of the show was changed to make sure that his taste buds were in the most active state.

While Star Plus denies that the show is aimed at promoting Congress, channel sources conceded that the idea was originally proposed to them by the party.

“We don’t want to get into political aspects of it; we liked the idea and we agreed to it, simple,” Uday claimed.

“It might help Rahul Gandhi, but then the earlier episodes of MasterChef could have helped Akshay Kumar too. But did anyone complain then?” he defended channel’s decision.

The new episodes will go live next week with Rahul Gandhi visiting a dalit contestant’s home in the first episode. He’d be spending a night there and will be accompanied by two other judges, identities of whom have not been disclosed yet.

In earlier editions of MasterChef, the other judges, apart from Akshay Kumar, were fulltime professional chefs. Sources claim that in the Uttar Pradesh edition, one of the “chefs” could be Digvijay Singh. Star Plus too didn’t rule out this possibility.

“Digvijay Singh is fond of cooking,” Uday Shankar claimed, “Brains, conspiracy theories, and allegations are some of the delicacies he cooks with aplomb. He can judge a cooking show. You shouldn’t be surprised.”

When contacted for comments, Digvijay Singh refused to deny or confirm his participation, but he made it clear that he didn’t like any food that was cooked by RSS hands. He refused to explain what he meant by “RSS hand”.

With assembly elections in the state less than a month away, the announcement has expectedly raised political temperatures. BJP has claimed that the third judge will be Manmohan Singh, who’d taste food and pronounce his judgment by just nodding or shaking his head.

“And guess what, even his silent preferences will be overturned by the chief judge Rahul Gandhi,” BJP alleged and demanded the resignation of Manmohan Singh.

BSP too has criticized the decision, which the party claims is a shameless advertisement of the Congress party and its yuvraaj.

“The Election Commission of India should cover all the television sets in the state so that people are not able to see the show and get fooled into voting for Congress,” BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra demanded.

Shedding further light on the unforeseen development, ISRO chairman Dr. K Radhakrishnan said, “Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was at hand to witness the premier space agency’s historic 100th mission from Sriharikota, was taking a keen interest in proceedings and casually enquired as to how it’s like out there.

When I replied that it’s just dark empty space permeated by unearthly silence, the PM abruptly excused himself, ostensibly to attend to a call of nature.”

With the PM missing from the control room even two minutes prior to take-off, his aides knocked on the bath-room door which was locked from the inside. When there was no response, they assumed everything was fine and went back to witness the exciting take-off, revealed sources.

“And then 10 minutes after take-off, as the rocket was about to attain escape velocity, Dr. Singh suddenly peeped out of one of the rocket’s windows to wave back at us. He evidently seemed to be in high spirits, looking forward to his journey,” revealed ISRO authorities.

PMO said the trip was planned in advance but the PM did not want to keep the ISRO in the loop. “These days Dr. Singh likes to jet off to foreign capitals when the going gets tough in New Delhi. So when the coal block allocation scandal broke out, the trip to Tehran couldn’t have come at a better time. He came back all recharged but to his dismay, the scandal had not died down and there were no foreign trips planned either for this month. So he opted to fly into outer space instead,” explained a PMO official.

The official allayed fears of the PM’s absence from earth leading to policy paralysis. “Dude, we officially don’t have any policy to begin with. So there is no question of paralysis,” he barked.

Later, Dr. Singh radioed the following message to the control room in Satish Dhawan Space Center: “For once, I well and truly seem to be on top of things. Feel so light in both body and mind. I’ll be back if and when Parliament reconvenes but if it yet again gets adjourned, I’ll stay here and continue to go around in circles.”

3099,0,"With calls for their retirement after a string of dismal performances in the current series against Australia, India’s aging legends have decided to extend their sporting careers by trying their hand at cricket’s close cousin, baseball. At the end of the 2nd day’s play in the Perth Test, Viru, Rahul, VVS, and Zak flew to New York to attend selection trials to get into the top professional baseball team in the world US, the New York Yankees.

Viru was the first to be trialled and took to baseball like a fish takes to water, hitting every ball pitched at him out of the ball park. “Boss, baseball suits my style perfectly. No foot-work required, no concept of defense, perfect,” raved the marauding opener, who will now be shifting base from Najafgarh to New Jersey and will not be available for the remainder of the Perth Test. The team management has given Viru the permission to go ahead since his absence won’t be felt much anyway in the ongoing series.

Unlike Sehwag, however, the others weren’t able to impress the Yankees’ selectors and were consequently rejected. Rahul Dravid, after meticulously reading up on the history of baseball, took guard to the New York Yankees bowler pitcher. The first ball pitched to him was a beamer that the Wall defended, doing well to keep it on the ground but refused to run to the next base and was ruled out. However, he was given a reprieve and asked to take guard again since he was not aware of the rules. Dravid then let 3 consecutive pitches go safely to the wicket-keeper catcher with an exaggerated forward stance, realizing they were well over the notional off-stump. To his dismay, the umpire brusquely ruled him out and a bewildered Dravid made his way back to the pavilion shaking his head. “Stupid game,” the Wall remarked later with undisguised contempt. “And they tell me there is no forward defense either and the batsman has to score off every ball. Dumb!!”

VVS was the next batsman in. The stylish Hyderabadi languidly fetched a pitch well outside off and elegantly flicked it away to the square leg fence. Satisfied, the batsman then nonchalantly proceeded to meander down the pitch to tap his bat on cracks in the pitch, by which time the fielders had already retrieved the ball from the boundary and run him out. A dumbfounded Laxman was told that there were no boundaries in Baseball and he had to run through the four bases to score a run. “What is this nonsense, ra?” grumbled VVS. “You have to run 4 bases to score a run?!! Thanks but no thanks. I think I’ll stick to cricket. Light theesko.”

Zaheer Khan, who tried out for pitching, deployed his usual tricks, covering the ball with his right hand, taking balls into and away from the batsmen alternatingly, with a sledge or two for good measure. But when the Yankees batsman hit him for three consecutive home runs, Zaheer quickly decided to concentrate on cricket. “With the old ball not being an option in baseball, it’s a little difficult for me to try out my reverse swing,” said Zak. “Besides, I can still dismiss left-handers in cricket.”

The BCCI, meanwhile, is in talks with American baseball stars to sign them on for the Baseball Premier League (BPL), fearing that Indians might not watch the IPL after the national team’s abject failure down under.","Indian batting legends switch to baseball, attend trials for New York Yankees",3287,2.312138728

The last such congregation of a galaxy of satraps had perhaps been for the investiture ceremony of the great Gupta Emperor, Samudra Gupta, in the fifth century AD. The symbolism was not lost on many: Just like emperors of yore, Narendra Damodardas Modi had conquered the hearts and minds of crores across vast swathes of India, extirpating those in the way, to claim the throne of Delhi. His power was now absolute, his authority unquestioned.

“I swear in the name of God,” President Pranab Mukherjee began and waited for the prime minister designate to respond. Narendra Modi stared back, dumbstruck. The President repeated his lines again but Modi remained silent, rivaling even the legendary Dr Manmohan Singh in sporting a pokerfaced countenance.

“I..I cannot do this, Mr President,” Modi finally muttered, “I have to heed my inner voice and….”

Modi wiped the beads of perspiration off his brow and continued, “make way for Shri Lal Krishna Advani to become the fifteenth prime minister of India.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the audience collectively gasped. Indian history was now witnessing another spectacular act of renunciation of temporal power, perhaps the most dramatic yet, in line with a fine and uniquely Indian tradition of sacrifice and self-abnegation dating back to the Buddha.

“N…Narendra…tu ne mujh pe kripa kar di, [Narendra, you have bestowed a huge favour upon me,” Advani, seated in the front row of the VVVVIP gallery, sniveled.

The remarks were quick to cloud the soon to be former prime minister designate’s eyes. “Kripaa…?” Modi wailed. “Advaniji, how can you use such a word, for the second time, in as many days? A son making way for his father is a kripa?” he managed to say before breaking down.

Recovering his composure after sipping a glass of water, Modi continued: “When Puru sacrificed his youth and forsook the kingdom for his father, Yayati, was it an act of kripa? When Gangaputra Bheeshma renounced the throne of Hastinapura so that his father could enjoy marital bliss, was he doing a favor? The BJP is like my mother, and you, sir, are like my father. I am merely doing my dharma.”

“Forgive me, Narendra,” Advani wailed. “I will not use that wretched word again. I am pleased that you are following in the great Indian tradition of self-sacrifice for the sake of elders. But…”

“But what, Advaniji? What great doubt assails you now in the moment of your triumph?” Modi queried, eyes gleaming with concern.

“What if you change your mind in a year’s time and usurp the throne from me again?” Advani wondered.

Modi calmly removed his specs, looked up at the skies, raised his hands, and proclaimed: “I, Narendra Damodardas Modi, keeping as witnesses those assembled in this august audience, hereby take the solemn oath that I renounce political office forever. I shall repair to the Himalayas to spend the rest of my mortal life in deep contemplation of the Upanishads and Brahman. If I am a true devotee of Maa Jagadambe, a true son of the BJP, a true bhakt of my mentor, Shri Lal Krishna Advani, may this undertaking come true.”

And then the rain came pouring forth as though the Gods could no longer hold back their tears. The very ground beneath the imperial Rashtrapati Bhavan seemed to shake, such was the severity of his oath. Conch shells blew in the foreground, priests showered flower petals on the figure of Narendra Modi, the latest entrant to the pantheon of great Indian monarchs who had conquered India not just politically but spiritually as well.

“Namo…Namo,” the audience now began to chant in messianic fervor. Even Lal Krishna Advani was now beholden. “Namo,” he chorused.

“Namo…Namo…Namo…..”

“Oh ji, save your enthusiasm for the actual moment,” Mrs Advani interrupted him.

“Eh? What?” Advani mumbled, snapping out of his reverie.

“Day dreaming again, uh? The oath taking ceremony is still two hours away, my dear. I know you are very happy for your protégé but I didn’t realize you felt this strongly!” Mrs Advani said.

“Yes, I feel very strongly about it,” Advani said, bursting into tears.",When Narendra Modi heeded his inner voice…,4753,2.629917947
3101,0,"Dr. Jayalalitha, the imperious and domineering CM of Tamil Nadu, has invited her counterparts –Mamta and Mayawati – to join her in launching a new national political alliance called the ABD (Amma – Behenji – Didi) front. Dr. Jayalalitha apparently got this idea after watching the Hollywood blockbuster, ‘Charlie’s Angels’.

Mamta and Maya were initially cold to the idea but have agreed to come on board after they also watched Charlie’s Angels. “Initially, I was skeptical about the 3 of us being able to get along. But all doubts melted away after watching Charlie’s Angels. Now we will complement each other and take on our political opponents as a lethal, all women team” said an upbeat Mamta to reporters.

Their political opponents have not taken this development lightly. Mulayam Singh, Karunanidhi, and Brinda Karat will be meeting shortly to watch the movie to visualize the consequences of the three powerful, female Chief Ministers teaming up to form a crack desi version of the Angels.

As part of the grand national alliance, Dr.Jayalalitha will campaign for the BSP in UP. Mayawati hopes that the charismatic TN chief Minister, who is an Iyengar, can bring UP Brahmin votes into the BSP’s kitty. However, Mayawati wants Jaya to make speeches in English rather than in Tamil accented Hindi which she fears might invite derisive taunts from some of the boorish sections of the crowds. Dr. Jayalalitha, who prides herself for being able to speak Hindi fluently, albeit with a south Indian accent, is not agreeable to this. “If Sonia can deliver Hindi speeches with a heavy Italian accent, why can’t I do the same with a south indian accent?” said the AIADMK supremo.

Uncorroborated reports suggest that BJP President, Nitin Gadkari, has approached the trio to ‘be their Charlie’.","Inspired by ‘Charlie’s Angels’, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, and Mamta team up politically",1792,2.176339286
3102,0,"Digvijay Singh has entered a twelve step program to help him stop blaming RSS. “I have a problem”, acknowledged Diggy when reached over the phone. “A big problem,” he added, “The problem is serious. At first, I used to feel the urge just after meals, 3 times a day. And, pretty soon, I started blaming RSS during drinking sessions. And then, it got out of control and I now blame the RSS at least 20 times a day, and often three times before breakfast”.

The last straw came when Diggy started blaming the RSS after his Missus complained about his not spending quality time with her. “That was when I realized that Diggy needs clinical help,” said a worried Mrs. Singh.

A health expert advising Diggy has warned that de-addiction is not going to be easy. “Often the person experiencing addictive behavior substitutes one addiction with another. In this case, we’ve asked Diggy to substitute RSS bashing with something more socially useful such as an anti-Karan Johar position, for instance, which we all can wholeheartedly approve”.

Later in the day, Diggy came out swinging with a verbally abusive tirade filled with invectives against the release of Agneepath. However, after an aide pointed out that Karan Johar’s banner is called Dharma Productions, Diggy went into a rant calling Karan a RSS agent, before medical personnel rushed in to pacify the agitated Congress leader. Diggy has now been advised to take an anti Yash Raj line to avoid another debilitating relapse. “It could lead to Diabetes but it will at least cure Diggy ji’s RSS addiction,” said his chief physician.

3103,0,"Buoyed by its win over BJP in Puducherry, Congress has reaffirmed its faith in the leadership of the Gandhis. Coming out of a three day soul searching exercise, the leaders of the party appeared aggressive like they did during Augusta discussion in the parliament. They questioned the media that has been trying to take the sheen off their momentous win.

“Rahul ji’s able leadership got us a majority in Puducherry. We also won maximum seats in the MCD elections of New Delhi. Our showing in the two UTs shows us that the young Gandhi’s leadership has finally started showing results,” said Digvijay Singh.

When asked about the defeats in the other major states where the elections happened, Singh seemed skeptical of the media. Arguing his point he retorted, “West Bengal chose Didi who is an ex-Congresswoman hence her win is our win. Gogoi losing the election was a wish granted by Rahul ji who decided to give the old man a break from his daily work load. He respects elders and wanted Gogoi to join Congress party’s Mookdarshak Mandal headed by Manmohan Singh.”

When asked about states like Kerela and Tamil Nadu, he deflected the question to Shashi Tharoor. Mr. Tharoor said that the disruptive politics played by BJP that introduced Sreesanth caused a sense of complacence among the Congress party cadre who felt they had already won the election when Sreesanth’s joined BJP. Tharoor said that Sreesanth was no Rahul Gandhi and hence overestimating his effect on the winning probability of the opposition was the major reason behind the debacle there. As for Tamil Nadu, the party has authorized Sonia ji to decide who caused the loss.

Rahul’s office released a press statement saying that the party will gain strength from victory in Puducherry and work towards ensuring success in other important union territories. He also signaled major overhauls before the next elections to keep the team on its toes. Several polling agents of the party in the losing states were sacked.

“Responsibility must be fixed. This introspection exercise was meant for this purpose only and we are glad that Rahul ji has taken the right step going forward. Unlike BJP that retained Amit Shah after poll defeats, we have sacked Amit Shah, one of our polling agents. This will give you an idea of the seriousness with which Rahul ji works,” said a pumped up Congress worker celebrating the Puducherry win outside Congress part HQ.

Needless to say, he has drawn significant ridicule from the denizens on social media, even as a handful of journalists claimed that this is proof of ‘Rahul Gandhi’s coming of age’.

“Rahul baba was answering questions on EPF tax roll back when suddenly a Times Now journalist barged in and asked a question on taxing of PPF and that’s when baba turned around and realized that Scindiaji was not sitting behind him. He coughed hard, pushed everyone aside, got inside his car, and asked me to google ‘difference between EPF and PPF’. Only then did he realize that they were different unlike MNREGA and NREGA,” claimed Rahul Gandhi’s driver who also happens to be a double post grad in economics.

“I sincerely apologize to Rahul baba for not renaming the EPF and PPF to Rajiv Gandhi Provident Fund and Indira Vikas Provident fund during the UPA rule. If we had done that, Rahul baba would have easily understood the difference and this situation would not have arisen,” said former Finance Minister P. Chidambram, while sipping wine at a Vineyard.

According to sources, this is not the first time Rahul Gandhi has used Google after delivering a fiery speech on a topic. A couple of weeks back, after he spoke at the JNU in support of the students, he had googled the difference between sedition and sedation, and belatedly realized that sedition had nothing to do with medicine.

“Last weekend, I saw him googling the difference between Communism and communalism when some JNU students claimed to be leftist and communist. He had assumed until then that it was the right-wing BJP that was communist, but a quick search clarified it for him. This is completely fine, and can happen to anyone. He’s growing in stature slowly and can take the top job in Congress anytime now,” said a senior NDTV journalist, whose secret fear was that Congress voters might one day google ‘Difference between Nehru Gandhi and Mahatma Gandhi’ and would come to know that Santa is not real.","After pressurizing rollback of EPF Tax, Rahul Gandhi googles ‘Difference between EPF and PPF’",2206,1.586582049

My head was still spinning from the Spanish trip that had been so delightfully lavish;

I suddenly realized I was winning Amethi, ah, which is just a dirt track,

Such a saving grace from my dear sister, what a rearguard attack;

My joy was shortlived, as mummy threw a spanner in the works,

I had to join the evening press conference, such a burden of my perks;

During the day, I had to endure, the obligatory phone calls,

Drowning me in their sorrows, their defeatism which appals;

First on the line was that mighty minister who was the toast of Harvard,

Consoling me on my career graph, now irrevocably downward;

I am smart enough to pay the finance minister, back in his own coin,

Since his son couldn’t keep his father’s seat, there must be a pain in his groin;

A personal visit by his lawyer colleague, who was busy banning websites,

His campaign crashed like his Bentely car, in a tunnel without headlights;

Jindal Saheb, was gracious enough, but I asked him to pack a coal block,

Sail with the wind, take an insurance, slip it into Adani’s shoe rack;

Mani Shankar Aiyar sees my dad, even in his bathroom mirrors,

Now that he has lost, he can start correcting Hindu alumnus’ typographical errors;

But saved me, my balloon and toffee from becoming election history;

Already picking the next fruit, such great sense of occasion;

Oily Moily, scraped through, he can now relax in KG Basin villa,

Thanking his stars, now he needn’t sweep the floors of Antilla;

Kamal Nath always wins his seat, it may be a matter of routine,

But Modi has reset the password of his ATM machine;

Our allies and us shared the dharma of coalition politics,

The loss of UPA brings their house down, mortar and bricks;

Raja couldn’t fix the price, for his Nilgris constituency,

The voters knew how to value the 2G frequency;

Praful Patel has a lifetime now to fly his favourite airline,

Will he ever get back to cockpit, despite his receding hairline;

Laloo with his wife & daughter, cow & iron plough,

Could have been our saviour, but his fortune too hit a plateau;

But the wily fox Sharad Pawar, he knows how to bye pass a Tsunami,

He played his games around even my wily mommy;

He sent his daughter into the field, and saved himself from injury,

Why do women get all the genes, I wonder at nature’s mystery;

And then there are those who licked the honey without being elected,

But still cannot runaway without their reputation unaffected;

On the top is Diggy Singh, who taught me everything tactical,

But alas, all he can now do, is ink his prenuptial;

Then there was the Sardar with an attached toilet,

He, Ranga, MMS and Chidu, what a quadruplet;

It is now the appointed time for the press conference,

I try to keep a sober face, the drill is about to begin,

But I finish my lines and slip into my stupid sheepish grin;

My momma takes the mike from me and keeps a brave face,

Superciliously greets the winner, totally lacking in grace;

I think it is mandatory to take atleast one audience query,

To comfort partymen who are in deep misery;

A gentle tug and a firm look, I shrink like a kitten,

3107,0,"A major scuffle broke out between the incarnation of Maharaja Jai Singh II, the original owner of Jantar Mantar and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday over the rights to use Jantar Mantar. However, the property dispute was later resolved when Mr. Kejriwal decided to leave the place and protest at Red Fort.

Maharaja Jai Singh II, who built Jantar Mantar in 1724, had reincarnated in 1967, and has been keeping an eye on his property for the past few decades from a tea stall across the road.

He was delighted to see tourists from all over the world coming in to admire the structure he constructed, and his self-esteem had hit an all time high when he learned from the tea stall owner that his Jantar Mantar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in India.

However, for the past few years, he started to become a bit wary of a muffler-clad gentleman sneaking into the premise on a regular basis with a group of people. Initially he gave him the benefit of the doubt assuming they were just a group of theater artists hired by the administrators to entertain the tourists, but soon he realized that the man was popping up almost every day.

“Damn, even I didn’t come here that often when I was the king,” grumbled Mr. Singh.

And on Saturday when Mr. Kejriwal sauntered to Jantar Mantar again after breakfast, he said, “Enough is enough,” and decided to confront him.

He patiently waited at the gate and when Mr. Kejriwal was leaving the ground after dharna, he stopped him and asked, “What are you doing here?”

Mr. Kejriwal was dumbfounded by the question. He was not expecting anyone to question his rights to enter the place he belongs to, and he mumbled,”Umm, protesting.”

“What?”

“We…ahem,” he cleared his throat and said, “We are protesting.”

“Fine, but why here?”

“This is the place where we come to when we have to protest. This is where magic happens.”

“Go and protest elsewhere.”

“Where else can we go?”

“Protest in your house, your office, or go to JNU, but stay away from my property.”

“Your property? Does this place have an owner?”

“Yes, I own this place.”

“Hello, this is our official protest venue and we will protest here.”

Mr. Singh lost his cool. He grabbed him by the collar and pushed him to the ground.

“Oh, I get it, a Modi agent!” said Kejriwal, a hint of rabid glee on his face. “Go and tell your boss that Kejriwal is not scared of anyone,” he hollered.

The news spread like wildfire and AAP supporters started tweeting about how Modi is not letting Kejriwal work. A few articles were hurriedly published about the emergency like situation created by Modi.

Meanwhile, a couple of policemen heard the commotion at the ground and rushed to the scene, screaming, “Ink attack, ink attack.”

“No, but it’s an attack on democracy. He is not letting me protest here,” Kejriwal pointed to Jai Singh.

“But why cannot he protest? He lives here,” one of the policemen asked Maharaja Jai Singh and then turned to Kejriwal and inquired, “You own this place, right?”

“Umm, no.”

“Then?”

“No, I mean, there are open spaces, ideal for protests and no one stops us so…”

“Then you cannot use this place,” asserted the police inspector.

“If Delhi police were under the control of AAP, I would’ve suspended you and this guy would’ve been behind the bars.”

“You mean he would’ve been giving company to your MLAs?” they giggled.

Kejriwal glared daggers at the policemen. “Fine, I am leaving. I will go to Red Fort.”

“Why do you need to protest at historical places?”

“Because I will create history!” he avowed and left for Red Fort.

Q: Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray never contested any election. His son and incumbent chief of the party, Uddhav Thackeray, followed his father’s footsteps. Why has Uddhav’s son Aaditya Thackeray chosen to break away from tradition and contest an election?

Q: Is Aaditya Thackeray also eyeing the chief minister or deputy chief minister’s post?

Q: Shiv Sena has also staked claim to the CM’s post. Isn’t there a contradiction between the stand of your party and that of BJP which says the alliance is contesting under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and after the election he will be chief minister?

A: I think we are looking at winning more than 100 seats. Simply because the people have seen our commitment to issues which concern the state. Whether we are in the government or outside, we have reached out to the people of the state. Issues that we have raised are very relevant. Also, the opposition has absolutely nothing to show in terms of convincing the people about what they feel is our ineffective governance. We have given clean governance as per the expectations of the people.A: I think people expect honesty and integrity in governance. Two political parties can broadly agree on ideological issues and a common vision for Maharashtra. But they could have their own perspective and point of view. Every time we have raised our voice, it is to represent the people of the state. We have been the voice of the people. As an alliance that has been together for 30 years, we think it is our responsibility to ensure that governance does not suffer at the expense of not listening to the voice of the people. The issues have been critical. As far as BJP and Shiv Sena are concerned, we have thrashed out these issues and resolved them, which is a win-win situation for Maharashtra, for governance and for the alliance.A: It doesn’t go against the spirit of the alliance. It is not a BJP versus Shiv Sena issue. This is city versus environment. We are already talking about how to ensure the city and environment can co-exist and they are not looked at in silos. Development cannot come at the cost of harming our environment, cutting down forests and doing away with wildlife. We want to ensure that the forest that exists in our city is not destroyed. Secondly, as far as the Metro project is concerned, we are in agreement that the city needs the Metro, development and better travel infrastructure support, but this particular issue is about the environment where there are other options that exist but have not been explored by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL). We will sit down with the government and thrash this out and ensure that Aarey remains a forest. Thirdly, it is also about change of land use. It will open up the entire Aarey forest and not just 500 to 700 trees. It will lead to rampant construction and development. This will lead to more land mafia involving themselves and creating problems for the city.A: It is nothing like a junior and senior partner partnership. Our aim is great governance in the state and working on common ideologies and vision, yet not compromising on our own set of beliefs. We are long-term allies for the past 30 years. As an ally we have even stayed out of power without compromising on issues. When Congress and NCP were in power, Shiv Sena never chose to break away from our alliance. As far as Shiv Sena and BJP contesting the 2014 assembly election separately, we did realise after the exercise, and so did the BJP, that people of Maharashtra expect us to be strong as a unit and we have to contest together.A: This is absolutely fair. Traditions are not something that cannot be broken. Every generation brings about a different style of leadership. Aaditya at 29 is willing to take charge, be held accountable and be held responsible and come on the back of an elected mandate. Secondly, Balasaheb Thackeray always espoused his belief as far as his leadership is concerned. Same with Uddhav ji. He has managed to steer the party along and only strengthen it in time. So, it is about sense of leadership.A: He [Aaditya] has clearly said that he is enjoying the process of contesting an election, seeking the mandate of the people, emerging victorious and will also take on any responsibility that comes his way as per the expectations of the people. He has already said that in his mind he is the “CM”, which is a “common man”. He will always remain the common man of Maharashtra.A: There is no contradiction and there will never be a contradiction. The alliance only continues to grow in strength. Recently, Uddhav Thackeray categorically said that as the party president he had given a promise to his father that every Shiv Sainik will work towards making a Shiv Sainik the chief minister. Every political party aspires towards building itself, towards expanding itself and towards reaching the goal that it has set for itself. This is the Shiv Sena’s goal. It doesn’t come with a timeline but it definitely comes with the intent that Maharashtra will have a chief minister from the Shiv Sena.A: Both political parties are different in their identities, they have a separate mandate that they get from the people of the state. Their manifestos have only added value to each other’s manifestos. Also, Uddhav ji categorically said in a press conference that because we did not have the time to sit together and come out with a common manifesto, nothing much should be read out of it. It is the common vision that both share.A: The Congress-NCP alliance's failure is not about a particular investigation case. It is about the people of the state rejecting their alliance because of the immense corruption that was involved during their 15 years of rule at the expense of the people.","Maharashtra elections: Shiv Sena’s goal is to have its own CM, says Priyanka Chaturvedi",6913,1.938376971

BALLABGARH (HARYANA): Launching a broadside against the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition party to explain ""its love"" for Article 370 to the families of security personnel martyred in Jammu and Kashmir Addressing his first of four election rallies in Haryana this week, he said the opposition was shedding ""crocodile tears"" and challenged the Congress to tell people that it will rescind the Modi government's decision on J-K if voted to power.Modi also targeted the Congress over Rafale, saying he was happy that despite its best efforts to stall the deal, the country had received first of the fighter jets, and stressed that the BJP was committed to strengthening security forces.After it swept the Lok Sabha polls , the BJP has again made nationalism its major poll plank in upcoming assembly elections, which will be the first in the country after the Centre's decision to scrap special status to J-K on August 5.Asserting that India is now taking big decisions like on Article 370 which were unthinkable earlier, the Prime Minister said the massive mandate from the people gave him the strength to take the step which, he asserted, has the backing of the entire country including Haryana.Some people whose interests have been affected are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations, the Prime Minister said, while again targeting the opposition on the issue as he did in poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday.Modi said the opposition parties in Haryana were crumbling and their attempts to come together are falling apart, while the BJP had a ""strong team and a strong captain"" in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar ""India is taking big decisions, which no one could think of earlier. Which decision am I talking about? This decision on Article 370,"" he said.Modi said there was feeling in Haryana and the entire country that J&K needs to be pulled out of spiral of violence and put on path of development.""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of trust and development and credit for this does not go to Modi, but it goes to 130 crore people of this country and voters of this country. You gave us big mandate and I derive strength from you to realise your dreams,"" he said.Modi accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370.""The entire country is also seeing people whose interests have been affected by the decision on Article 370 are in a state of shock. These people are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations.""""Those who are unable to sleep and 'j', if these people have so much liking for Article 370 and 35-A, then I challenge them why don't they muster courage and go before people of Haryana and tell them that if they win elections, they will bring back Article 370 and 35-A,"" Modi said.On Sunday, Khattar too had used a Hindi proverb """" to take a swipe at the Congress' three-month effort at choosing a president, drawing ire of the opposition party. The proverb suggests there was much ado about noting. Though literally, it means finding a mouse after digging a mountain.He said those opposing the decision know that Modi government got overwhelming public mandate and support because of which the Centre was able to take a decision on Article 370.He asked people to go to villages and make people understand the benefits of the step.Training guns on opposition, he said ""because of their love for Article 370 mothers lost their brave sons and young women were widowed"".""The brave jawan of Haryana who was protecting innocent citizens of J&K, who fell to bullet of terrorists and when his body came back wrapped in tricolour, ask those mothers how many sons-of-soil lost lives because of your love for Article 370... ask how many were widowed and how many children were orphaned,"" he said at the rally in the state which sends a large numbers of youths in security forces.""Those who lost their dear ones for peace in J&K, Congress leaders must tell them why they love Article 370 so much. They must tell in what way this Article benefited the state,"" he saidTaking a dig at Congress, Modi said, it should ""tell people that it will reverse what Modi has done. And when Lok Sabha elections come, mention in manifesto that they will reverse these decisions. Do they have the courage to say so?""He said the Dalit community in Jammu and Kashmir was deprived of decent jobs there. He said that wards of people belonging to 'Valmiki' community were never considered capable of other jobs than sweeping and toilet cleaning for four generations.Modi also accused the Congress of doing votebank politics over triple talaq issue, alleging the opposition parties made every kind of excuse to stall the law against triple talaq.""Congress and other parties like them stood like a wall in the way of each betterment and change you have seen,"" Modi alleged.A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi again rake up the Rafale deal issue , the Prime Minister alleged that the opposition made their best efforts to ensure the agreement for fighter jets was cancelled.You remember, during Lok Sabha polls, how they made a hue and cry over the Rafale deal. They were beating their chests and made their best efforts to ensure that the agreement for Rafale was cancelled, he said.Modi said that he was happy that India had got its first Rafale aircraft.He said that it was not acceptable to him that country's soldiers become victims of the enemy in the absence of necessary arms and ammunition.Modi accused the previous Congress government of putting Tejas project, the home-built jet, on the back burner.""Don't know (it was done) under whose pressure. Our government has removed all the bottlenecks and gave wings to this project,"" he said.He said undertaking development and bringing change in people's lives has always been his priority.Modi praised Khattar, saying his team has taken Haryana to new heights of development.He said the more the opposition parties are trying to come together, the more they are falling apart.Modi began his address by saying the place is not far from here where during Emergency days former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was arrested and put behind bars for 19 months.Seeking to strike an emotional chord, he said, ""When I am amongst you, when I come to Haryana, I always feel like I am coming to my home.

To do so, the king of business jargon will tailor his cutting edge management theories that have launched the careers of scores of managers across diverse sectors of the economy for a cricketing context.

The curriculum includes electives such as ‘Dare to think beyond subcontinental pitches’, ‘Discover the Michael Clarke in you’ and ‘Count your runs before they are scored’, informed sources in IIPM . Dr. Chaudhuri will also conduct a special course just for Sachin to help him get his 100th 100. The course has been aptly titled ‘Dare to think beyond 99’.

Indian skipper, Mahandra Singh Dhoni, has enthusiastically signed up for the program. “Well of course, it’s a good move, but given the uncertain future of my Test career, I am more interested in their regular MBA courses,” added Captain Cool, grinning sheepishly.

Rahul Dravid has declined to attend the course saying, “Actually, I have applied to Harvard for a PhD in ‘History of Cricket in British colonies in the southern hemisphere’. Don’t have time for this IIPM shit.” VVS said he will attend provided the lectures are interspersed with Telugu movies starring voluptuous babes.

The BCCI has no issues with members of the cricket team attending the IIPM course as long as the course schedule doesn’t clash with IPL5. “To be honest, we have no idea what corrective measures to take in wake of the debacle Down Under. So if Ponytail… er… I mean…Dr. Chaudhuri can turn things around, we can even make him the next cricket coach,” said BCCI President, N Srinivasan.

Popular cricket commentator and former Test cricketer, Ravi Shastri, was more circumspect. “I know you want me to say ‘this is just what the doctor ordered’ but I’ll hold back until I see results,” said Shastri to The Unreal Times.",Arindam Chaudhuri dares Indian cricket team to think beyond flat home pitches,1938,1.857585139

Elphinstone Road to Prabhadevi, Colaba Causeway to Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Victoria Terminus to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Bombay to Mumbai — 71 years after independence, Mumbai’s colonial past is still at the heart of its politics. In 2018, the renaming of the city’s roads, buildings, junctions and monuments was the second-most discussed issue in the civic body, according to a report by the Praja Foundation.

Why do away with colonial names for legacy structures so many years later, what goes into the renaming, and, will old Mumbaiites ever use the new names?

The patron goddess of the local Koli community, Mumbadevi, took centrestage in the city’s politics in 1995, the year Bombay became Mumbai. The Shiv Sena, the party in power that year, pushed for the change to champion the cause of the Marathi-speaking “sons of the soil”. Today, the renaming of cities is back to being a top agenda for politicians, with the Sena pushing to change the names of two Maharashtrian cities — Aurangabad and Osmanabad — after cities in Uttar Pradesh were renamed.

But, what does it mean for a diverse city like Mumbai? It’s part of the city’s natural evolution, said Tasneem Mehta, trustee of the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, known till 1975 as the Victoria and Albert Museum. “The museum is about India and Indian traditions,” said Mehta. “Bhau Daji Lad was instrumental in setting it up, he raised the funds, he did the research. I think it’s a very appropriate choice.”

Mehta, however, added that a name change doesn’t mean the history is lost. “The history will always be there, but perhaps, it has greater relevance to the community now.”

There are others who believe renaming public spaces goes hand in hand with the politics of statue removals, which first gained momentum during the Samyukta Maharashtra movement of the 1950s and 1960s — and again over the past few years. It was the Samiti that had demanded the creation of a separate Marathi-speaking state from the State of Bombay — which at the time covered both Maharashtra and Gujarat.

“After the statue of Queen Victoria was removed from the Victoria Terminus [now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus], no one knows where it was taken,” said Aadil Desai, a member of the Bombay Local History Society (BLHS). “The statue of the prince of Wales that was at Kala Ghoda was moved to Rani Baug.” Incidentally, Rani Baug was originally called Victoria Garden. Its name was changed to Jijamata Udyan, after Shivaji’s mother Jijabai – a reminder of how the Maratha king still serves as a potent symbol of Marathi identity.

In some cases, the new Indian names have nothing to do with the monument or its origins. For instance, the Prince of Wales Museum was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. “Since we are doing away with colonial names, Prince of Wales had to go. But a simple name such as ‘Museum of Western India’ would have better defined the architecture and scope of the museum,” a city historian pointed out.

Meanwhile, there is an emerging voice amongst Mumbaiites who believe the name-changes remain on paper.

“The old name is the old name. A true Bombay man will die saying Altamount Road (even though it was renamed SK Barodawallah Marg almost three decades ago),” said city historian Deepak Rao. “If you tell a taxi-wallah to go to Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, he will not understand.” What is today Shahid Bhagat Singh Road was actually four areas in south Mumbai — Colaba Road, Colaba Causeway, Custom House Road, and Mint Road, Rao explained.

Then, there are those concerned about the logistic challenges the name changes pose. “Many street names are important, not only because they represent the local history of the area, but also for navigation,” said Pankaj Joshi, president, Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI). “This especially happens with the renaming of chowks. So, if you are travelling by a BEST bus, you may end up going to Colaba while you’re looking for something in Byculla.”

Joshi said to do away with this confusion, there was a suggestion in the heritage committee several years ago to keep the new name but also mention the old name in brackets. “That way, you have the historical reference and people won’t get confused, at least for a few years.”

The zeal to Indianise localities and roads has also left in its trail some faux pas.

“When a name change is proposed by an elected representative in the civic body, it is referred to the respective ward officers. The ward officers are responsible for inspecting the area and ensuring the new name falls in line with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s norms,” said a senior civic official. “One of these norms is that the name of a road cannot be changed if it is an Indian name.”

There is a renewed interest in naming streets and railway stations after the 19th century social reformer Jagannath (Nana) Shankarshet, said Desai of the BLHS. “Gunbow Street, renamed Rustom Sidhwa Marg, was a name given by the British to honour an Indian, Ganba Shet, one of Nana Shankarshet’s ancestors. Gunbow was a corrupted form of Ganba,” Desai said. “But Gunbow Street was renamed Rustom Sidhwa Marg as it was assumed to be a colonial name!”",Politics and emotions behind renaming Mumbai’s streets,5251,2.380498953

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country.",2 PFI members arrested for Delhi violence; 1 of them had fought Assembly polls,2079,1.875901876

A few prominent Jihadi leaders in the state have severely censured the media for their flagrant lack of enthusiasm in covering their activities.

“For the levels of heroics and daring missions that we’ve executed, right from radicalizing people, storing explosives and firearms to manufacturing bombs, carrying out blasts to finally drawing the NIA’s serious attention, we deserved to completely engulf at least a week’s prime-time debates on all channels,” a Jihadi leader said, on the condition of anonymity. “But all we’ve been seeing on prime time on all channels are some inconsequential ramblings. Every night, I sat with bated breath and watched The Newshour, hoping that Arnab would tear Derek da or any other TMC spokesperson to shreds, but he’s only been pouncing on Gurunath Meiyappan, Nitin Gadkari and some Khap leaders,” the leader added.

“People are completely right when they said that Arnab is biased. The other day, we got so excited that he was doing a discussion with the hashtag #NewIndianTaliban. For a moment, we went into such a tizzy, assuming that we were finally getting not just our due recognition, but the honor of being equated to the legendary Taliban! But when we clicked on the trend, we ended up banging our heads in shame – turns out it’s some Hindu Mahasabha folks making some silly statements!” another leader sighed. “That’s not just all – he lashes out at Gadkari for hours for, wait for it, not wearing a helmet! But when it comes to people like us, even such chilling activities of terror aren’t sufficient to draw his outrage. Very demotivating!” the leader added.

“Forget Arnab, my favorites are Sreenivasan Jain and Rajdeep Sardesai. I was and am utterly shocked to know that our blasts are not even of the chota-mota level for Vasu sir to talk about. I was waiting for some condemnation from Rajdeep too – I thought he would grab this chance to ask us ‘Did Narendra Modi teach you to Make bombs in India? Did BJP teach you to make bombs?’ and pass remarks like ‘Tumhaare paas bombs hai, lekin class nahin‘ (You have bombs, but no class) but there was nothing of the sort. Only NRI crowds seem to have that privilege. Forget all that, yaar, even a short Vine video of him saying ‘Why has West Bengal turned into a terror hub? Read my book!’ on Twitter, would’ve been gratifying for us, but even that wasn’t to be. So bloody unfair!” another Jihadi said.

“Last, but not least, even Sagarika, though expecting her to mention our religion is very rich and asking for too much, I thought she would at least mention us by labeling us non-Jat, non-Maratha, non-Brahmin Jihadists, but nope! If this lack of coverage continues, I’m afraid we’ll have to just quit terrorism and take up some other jobs man,” the leader cried out.",Now West Bengal Jihadists themselves slam mainstream media for muted coverage of their activities,2978,2.384150437

Jignesh, a 7-year old boy from Gandhinagar, has complained of Modi’s arch-rival’s posters making their way into his dreams. “It was scary! All I could see was posters of Sanjay uncle all over! We go to sleep, thinking that it would give us solace from reality. But even in my dreams, I could vividly see posters of Sanjay uncle haunting me wherever I traversed!” cried Jignesh.

The incident has sent the mainstream media into a tizzy, with all leading news channels reporting it as a severe blow to the Narendra Modi government and the BJP. Times Now Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami anchored the noisiest episode of Newshour till date, roping in six panelists to debate whether Sanjay Joshi was emerging as “a serious threat” to Modi’s Prime Ministrial ambitions. The debate that started with one of Arnab’s trademark part-rhetorical-part-outraged tirade, ended up with him helplessly trying to get a word in, as BJP’s Smriti Irani and Congress’ Renuka Chaudhry went after each other in a blur of cacophony.

The BJP, however, has denied that any of its cadre may have a hand in the incident. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad defended his party-men, saying, “This is certainly the handiwork of miscreants. None of our party members would ever do such a thing. Some anti-BJP elements are involved in this case of inception!” When asked how he was so sure of this, Prasad said, “Boss, if any of our party members knew inception, don’t you think the first thing they would have done is plant the idea of retirement deep down in Advaniji’s dreams? For what joy would they plant Joshi’s posters in a useless little boy’s dream?”

3120,0,"As the politics of Shiv Sena with respect to the BJP and in particular, the state of mind of Uddhav Thackeray, become progressively difficult to interpret, exasperated BJP leaders, in a last ditch measure, have resorted to the abstruse field of Quantum Mechanics to try and describe what Uddhav Thackeray is trying to do.

The idea to resort to arcane physics to interpret the increasingly bizarre politics and signals emanating from the BJP’s erstwhile ally was mooted by senior BJP leader Dr Murali Manohar Joshi, after Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley sought guidance from the Margdarshak Mandal, BJP’s highest decision making body and repository of hoary wisdom of its veteran leaders.

“After Narendra bhai described what the state of BJP-Shiv Sena affairs over the last few weeks, I thought there were parallels with Quantum Mechanics,” recalled Dr Murali Manohar Joshi. “Quite frankly, the topic went over my head too when I was pursuing my Physics PhD thesis but perhaps having an expert in Quantum Mechanics model Uddhav Thackeray as a time-dependent Schrödinger wave function can help us unravel the the random politics of Uddhav Thackeray drawn from the underlying esoteric probability distributions.”

Dr Joshi cautioned his young wards that Quantum Mechanics can only estimate the underlying probability distributions since quantum particles and Uddhav Thackeray do not have exactly determined properties. “The Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies to Uddhav,” Dr Joshi reasoned. “The more precisely we know his position, the less precisely we know which way he’s heading, and vice versa.”

Dr Joshi also took his wards through the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment to characterize the state of Shiv Sena’s ties with the BJP, which like Shcrodinger’s cat could be simultaneously dead and alive.

The Quantum Mechanics 101 lesson has becalmed the minds of Modi, Shah and Jaitley. “We don’t claim that we understood everything that Dr Joshi said but at least it makes more sense than a layman-esque approach to dealing with Uddhav Thackeray,” said a much relieved Amit Shah.

While the Indian women’s team bonded over cricket, gym sessions, music, dance, selfies, and their victories on the field, the parents of some of the team’s key players arrived in Australia to do some bonding of their own.

Why is this significant? Well, for some parents, this will be the first time they’ll be watching their daughters play in an international match—a World Cup final is a good way to make that debut.

“I am excited to have my parents by my side in the climax of the World Cup,” said captain Harmanpreet Kaur during a press conference in Sydney after the semi-final tie was washed away. “My mother has never seen me in action on the field. My father has seen me play in college and school matches but never during an international game. For the first time they are travelling abroad, I feel very proud and emotional. Unfortunately, there was no game against England but they will be cheering us in the final.”

Kaur, who is from Moga in Punjab, became the first cricketer in India—male or female—to play 100 T20 internationals last October.

19-year-old middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ parents will be in attendance at the final too.

“From playing locally to stadiums, they’ve been by my side, working behind the scenes, and now have traveled across continents to make sure we have all the support we need! Nothing greater than taking on the World Cup with the strength of our parents by our side. Let’s do this,” tweeted Rodrigues.

Then there’s 16-year-old Shafali Verma, who’s taken the tournament by storm with her explosive batting—her father, Sanjeev, who was also her first coach, has never seen her play in an international match. That will change when walks into the MCG on Sunday.

It took some doing—the goldsmith from Rohtak was sponsored by the school Shafali attends to fly to Melbourne, while the Haryana Cricket Association pitched in to get him a quick visa.

“Apni betiyon ko World Cup jeetne hee toe dekhne aaye hain hum. Shafali bahut khush hai and final main bhi apne chauke and chakke marna chahti hai. Harman ne usko khuli choot di hai maarne ki (We have come here to see our girls win the World Cup. Shafali is very happy and wants to hit fours and sixes in the final. Harmanpreet has given her full freedom),” said Sanjeev from Melbourne.

Meanwhile, Australia pace spearhead Mitchell Starc will be at the final clash too, after being granted permission by the Australian cricket board to miss the final ODI against South Africa so he can watch his wife Alyssa Healy, the team’s wicket-keeper, in action. Starc said it was a “fantastic opportunity” to repay Healy after she was in attendance in 2015 when Australia won the men’s ODI World Cup at home.

Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry has been ruled out of action for at least six months as she will undergo surgery on her injured hamstring next week.

It was during Australia final group game of the T20 World Cup against New Zealand that Perry had injured her right hamstring while trying an athletic throw in the field.

“The timing has been good, I still get to come tomorrow and next week I’ll (have surgery),” Perry was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“From my perspective, I’ve had the most incredible run, I’ve been very fortunate with injury for a long period of time,” added the 29-year-old, whose injury was the most severe for her in more than 12-year international career.

Perry, who is the reigning ICC Cricketer of the Year, will be out of Australia’s upcoming limited-overs tour of South Africa, beginning next Sunday, and also unlikely to feature in the upcoming Indian Premier League exhibition games in May.

Although she will not be able to turn up for Sunday’s final against India, Perry is happy she will be able to cheer for the team.

“I’m really excited about tomorrow. I think it’s one of those opportunities now for the whole squad to enjoy the occasion and make the absolute most of it, it’s a very special time,” she said.

“I’‘ll be trying to keep my nerves at bay. I feel incredibly fortunate and chuffed that Motty and the group wanted to keep me around, it’‘s nice to be here and take it all in.”","Injured Ellyse Perry to undergo surgery, ruled out for 6 months",1483,2.4275118

“I usually dish out acronyms and expansions at the snap of a finger, but for this one, I’d like to take my time and come up with what should be called as my best expansion till date. But it won’t be too long either. I’ll definitely unveil the expansion in this month’s Mann Ki Baat. This gesture of mine should convey to Behenji, how sorry my party and I feel for the crass remarks made against her. If this doesn’t pacify her, nothing else will,” PM Modi told The UnReal Times. “But first things first, mitron! DAYASHANKAR stands for Dumb, Asinine, Yucky, Abysmal, Stupid, Horrendous, Atrocious, Nonsensical, Khatarnaak, Appalling Rascal,” leading to rousing applause and hysteria from all quarters.

Sources added that the PM has also sent BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra to the BSP supremo to do his hilarious imitation of Navjot Sidhu and make her laugh herself out. “That ought to cheer her up in no time. Dude, come on! It worked instantly on the nation’s angriest man, so it is bound to work on anyone! To quote Yashwant Sinha, any ch***ya will laugh on seeing that video!” a PMO official added. Senior party leaders, however, maintain that the party had already taken the strongest action possible and that the PM’s intervention wasn’t really required. “Dude, the BJP state president of UP resigned even without me having to demand it! What more do people want?” thundered a livid Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Rival parties Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, who spare no opportunity to tear into the PM, admitted to feeling compelled to take the PM’s side this time. “Modi is a psychopath and coward. But in this case, I am with him. This is the greatest and the sweetest thing he can do for anyone, let alone Behenji. I hope he comes up with the most kickass expansion ever. Good luck, Modiji!” Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said, in a rare moment of bonhomie, before proceeding to frantically call up theatres screening Kabali in New Delhi. “With the elections around the corner, he had no other choice, so he had to step in. But personally coming up with an expansion for her? Wow wow wow! Is a party alliance on the cards or what?” tweeted UP Congress in-charge Raj Babbar, before gorging on a 12 Rs. lunch.

3125,0,"Having realized Anurag Kashyap’s forthcoming movie Udta Punjab was hogging all the limelight, the Aam Aadmi Chief, Arvind Kejriwal released his own movie Udta Aam Aadmi. After spending sleepless nights for not getting media attention, the core committee of AAP realized the only way to counter the popularity of Udta Punjab was to come up with a movie. It was completed in record time and given a 5 star rating by Shri Kejriwal himself.

Udta Aam Aadmi is an action drama film produced by the in-house production team of Mr. Kejriwal, The Aam Aadmi Entertainment, a renowned name in movie fraternity that has often promoted fresh talents in the field of arts and entertainment, and it’s a dream for any producer to get his/her movie reviewed by Mr. Kejriwal.

The movie is a biopic on Aam Aadmi Party chief, Arvind Kejriwal , which portrays the struggles of common people of Delhi and how the revolutionary fights the evils of the society.

Spoiler alert! Please do not read the following plot summary if you have not seen the film

Plot

The protagonist, Arvind Kejriwal, is a goatherd in a village called Delhi who is constantly troubled by the sufferings of his fellow villagers. One day, he assumes that the village sarpanch Ajeeb Jung and thanedaar M.S. Bassi are responsible for all their hardships and wages war against them. As the clock strikes midnight, he disguises himself with a muffler and throws stones at Ajeeb Jung’s house while his friend Kumar Viswas hides behind a tree and sings, “Andheri raaton mein sunsaan rahon par.”

He soon realizes that Jung and Bassi are just pawns and the real villain is an evil dictator called Gajendra Modi, and decides to use Jung and Bassi as tools to reach Modi. Meanwhile, Jung complains to Modi about Kejriwal who sends his soldiers to Kejriwal’s house to steal his ‘odd-even’ formula, which is believed to be the best work by any mathematician post the demise of Ramanujan. Enraged and embittered, Kejriwal reaches Modi’s palace and thunders, “You coward and psychopath!” He challenges Modi to a face off and menacingly walks towards him with his gaze fixed on the throne. The movie ends there with a message flashing on the screen – “The beginning.”

Udta Aam Aadmi was screened at Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday and received critical acclaim, and it will release in theaters on July 6th, forcing Aditya Chopra, the producer of Sultan to postpone the release date of his movie to avoid box office clash.","Frustrated over losing media attention to Udta Punjab, Kejriwal releases own film ‘Udta Aam Aadmi’",2461,1.747257213
3126,0,"Mumbai: A day after removing 4 scenes from the Akshay Kumar starrer ‘Jolly LLB 2’, Bombay High Court has instructed the film’s producers to increase the film’s length. Since the film depicts a court case, the honorable Court observed that a 3 hrs court case will send a wrong message that court cases can get wrapped up that quickly. The producers have been asked to stretch the film for at least 10 yrs to make it believable.

The Courts vs Jolly LLB

A petition was filed by a local lawyer here who accused the filmmakers of misrepresenting facts. It was argued that if people see that court cases can be settled in 3 hrs then they will start questioning why their cases are continuing for decades. This could lead to serious loss of trust and people will start doubting the efficiency of the lawyers and the judges.

Passing the verdict, the High Court bench observed ,”Everyone has freedom of expression but that doesn’t mean we should misrepresent reality. No serious case can get settled in 3 hrs and we should not mislead people by showing such a scenario. The film should be at least 10 yrs long to give an actual picture of our judicial system. If people don’t have the patience to make or watch such a long film then they should explore other subjects for their films.”

Further, the judgement read ,”If the producers don’t want to spend the money on a very long film then they can show 5 minutes of the film on one day and schedule the next 5 minutes on a date few months later. This way, their 3 hrs long film can easily be completed in 10 yrs while showing the actual reality of our judicial system.”

Meanwhile, the film’s producers are wondering whether they should appeal against this judgement or just upload the film on a torrents website.","Increase Jolly LLB 2's length, 3 hrs court case sends wrong message to society: Bombay High Court",1757,1.25213432

The move was precipitated by Lt. Governor Jung’s refusal to accept Kejriwal’s resignation.

“I am no longer his well wisher after he called me a Congress agent,” a miffed Jung told The UnReal Times. “And this after I sent him home cooked paranthas during his dharna and threw him a lifeline. Now, like his other detractors, I also want him to continue in power for as long as possible.”

With an escape route in the form of resignation no longer available, the AAP leadership is pinning its hopes on defeating its own government in the Delhi Assembly so that it can go back to agitation mode and fight the Lok Sabha elections with renewed gusto. “Anyway AAP rebel MLA Binny and that Shokeen guy hate our government in addition to ourselves,” revealed AAP rajguru, Yogendra Yadav, “which means at least 29 MLAs will vote against us. We are hopeful that we will lose more support elsewhere so that we can vote out our government to go down in a blaze of glory and regain the moral high ground which we seem to have lost.”

However, both the BJP and Congress said they are determined to keep AAP in power for as long as possible. “We want to assure the public that no matter how much they provoke us – whether it be through insults, abuse, allegations or filing of FIRs – we are determined to support them and will defeat their no confidence motion against themselves,” said Delhi Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely.

A livid Arvind Kejriwal has slammed the BJP and Congress for not wanting to pull down his government. “This shows their true colours,” he snarled. “They don’t want the AAP to succeed by letting it fail.

Updated: Feb 09, 2020 06:51 IST

After a high-decibel and bitter poll campaign, 61.7% of Delhi’s electors turned out to vote by 9 pm on Saturday in the assembly elections that will decide who will govern the city-state for the next five years. The polling percentage was 5.42 percentage points lower than in the 2015 assembly polls, when 67.12% of voters trooped out to vote.

Three Muslim-dominated seats -- Seelampur, Mustafabad and Matia Mahal -- recorded the highest voter turnout in the elections in which the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in what is seen as a bipolar contest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The highest turnout, until 9 pm, was recorded in Seelampur at 71.4% followed by Mustafabad at 70.56%; both seats are in northeast Delhi. Matia Mahal in old Delhi recorded a turnout of 70.33%.

All three constituencies have lately witnessed protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, which proposes to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to so-called persecuted minorities from the Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan such as Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis.

According to officials, the turnout in the first hour of polling was just 4.33%, which grew to 16.36% at 11 am, 26.36% at 1 pm, 45.54% at 3 pm and 57.87% at 5 pm. Till 5 pm, the Northeast district had recorded he highest voter turnout at 63.4% while New Delhi district was the lowest at 44.29%.

Poll officials said that the tentative lowest turnout till 9 pm was recorded at Delhi Cantonment, at 45.28%, followed by Chhatarpur at 46.51% and Ballimaran at 49.39%. Okhla witnessed a 58.83% voter turnout, which is lower than the 60.73% in the 2015 polls.

On constituencies recording top turnout and one of the lowest -- Ballimaran -- being Muslim-dominated constituencies, Praveen Rai, political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, said: “Ballimaran and Okhla are constituencies in which the anti-CAA protests in Jama Masjid and Shaheen Bagh fall under. It is likely that many voters have boycotted the polls. In other Muslim constituencies, people voted in large numbers for betterment in civic conditions as well as in reaction to their anxieties concerning the citizenship law.”

In the 2015 assembly election, Gokalpur in northeast Delhi had recorded the highest turnout of 73.46% while Delhi Cantonment had polled the lowest votes at 58.49%. All assembly constituencies except Delhi Cantonment had polled above 60% votes in 2015 assembly elections.

In 2015, the ruling AAP received a landslide verdict, winning 67 out of the 70 seats. The BJP won the remaining three and the Congress ended up with none.

The AAP won 54% of the vote share in the polls which decreased in the civic body polls of 2017 and the Lok Sabha elections of 2019. The BJP polled 32% votes in the 2015 assembly polls which increased to 36% in the 2017 civic body elections. The saffron party won 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Delhi’s chief electoral officer (CEO) Ranbir Singh said that Saturday’s polling was smooth and peaceful, as the enforcement was better compared to the 2015 assembly polls. He said that there were nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi across 70 assembly segments. Out of the total number of eligible voters, there were 8.1 million male voters and 6.6 million female voters. Besides this, there are 869 third-gender voters.

Singh said that the number of electronic voting machines (EVMs) malfunctioning this time was just 0.29% as compared to 0.31% in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Voting began at 8 am in the city amid tight security on Saturday and continued past the scheduled close of 6 pm in some booths to accommodate voters who were still waiting in queues.

“Till 9 pm, polling was still on at least 146 booths. There were long queues till late evening; the overall turnout could be updated only once the voting concludes. All those who had entered the polling stations by 6 pm were allowed to cast their vote,” said Singh.

Election officials said that there were as many as 13,571 polling stations at 2,688 locations. Out of these, 3,141 were designated critical polling stations and 144 vulnerable polling stations. The highest number of voters was in the Matiala constituency with around 400,000 voters. Chandni Chowk is the constituency with the lowest number of voters at 100,000.

There were around 200,000 voters above the age of 80, while 137 registered voters were above the age of 100, of whom 60 turned up to vote.

Of the 2,429 people above the age of 80 years, who opted for postal ballots, 2,257 cast their votes. Besides, of the 488 persons with disabilities who opted for the facility, 429 exercised their franchise.

The postal ballot, a facility hitherto restricted to the armed forces, was extended for the first time in Delhi elections to those above 80 years of age and the specially abled.

Also, in the 11 constituencies with a total electorate of 1.8 million where QR code-enabled voter slips were issued for the first time in Delhi, more than 1.1 million exercised their franchise.

“The voter slips are scanned by mobile phones. This is the first time that a booth app was used by the polling parties in these constituencies. It helps in faster scanning of names in the voter list and hence expedites the voting process,” said Kushal Pathak, director of information, Election Commission of India.

To ensure peaceful and fair polling in all 70 constituencies, as many as 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) were deployed. Besides, 19,000 Home Guards and 42,000 Delhi Police personnel were also on duty.",Three Muslim-dominated seats record highest voter turnout in Delhi assembly election,5848,3.385772914

LUCKNOW: Attacking the opposition for ""misleading"" people on the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the law will not be scrappedover it.Addressing a rally here in support of the CAA , Shah also declared that""touching the skies"" in Ayodhya will begin within three months.The minister accused the Congress of not implanting the suggestions that came from its own leaders in the past on granting citizenship to minority Hindus in Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and Afghanistan after Partition.He also targeted West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee , saying she is now opposing Indian citizenship for Dalit Bengalis.At the same meeting, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that the Congress is shelling out money for “arson” and protests over the CAA.Amit Shah said there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone's citizenship away. “A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, SP, BSP, and Trinamool Congress.”The CAA is a law to grant citizenship, he added.“I want to say that irrespective of the protests it will not be withdrawn,"" he added.Shah challenged opposition leaders to hold a discussion with him on the CAA at a public forum.He named Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav , Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee while throwing the challenge.""If any clause of the CAA takes away the citizenship of anyone, including Muslims, they can tell me. The agitations and sit-ins, which are being organised in the country against it, are wrong,"" he said.""The Congress has become blind due to vote bank politics,"" he said, and also blamed the party for Partition.""Rahul baba open your ears and listen carefully. Because of the sins of your party in 1947, the country's partition on religious basis was accepted.” Mentioning figures, he said the proportion of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in Pakistan and Bangladesh dropped drastically after Partition.""Where have they gone? They were either killed, converted or came to India as refugees. These blind people cannot see that atrocities were committed on crores of people,"" he said.Shah asked opposition parties where they were when “crores of people were killed” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on the basis of religion.He said five lakh Pandits were displaced from Kashmir, “but these parties did not utter a word”.“Now, because of PM Modi, a new chapter has begun in the lives of these people,"" he said.Shah referred to the recent Supreme Court verdict that allows the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site. The crowd cheered when he said the construction will begin in three months.Accusing the opposition of speaking the language of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, the BJP leader said, ""I don't know what relation they have with Khan.""Shah claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Indira Gandhi advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan but their Congress party never implemented the suggestion.On Mamata Banerjee, he charged, ""She was demanding citizenship for Dalit Bengalis. Now when the citizenship is being given to them, she has problems.""Shah claimed that during the Rajasthan assembly elections, the Congress had advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan.The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who entered India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution.

3131,0,"In an unexpected turn of events, film director and producer Ram Gopal Varma has declared that he would contest the Presidential elections against the UPA nominee Pranab Mukherjee. The veteran director told The Unreal Times that he will not let Mr Mukherjee win unopposed.

“I might lose, but will still contest the Presidential poll. Pranab da is a friend, but I oppose his candidature. He hasn’t revealed the names of black money holders, which was my only chance to find out who could finance my films, given that no one else is ready to,” said the Bollywood director.

Asked if it was worth risking losing face in the elections, given that the odds are stacked against him, the veteran director waved away the suggestion, “Oh, I can totally take a setback. My movies Naach, Phoonk, Agyaat have all taught me this lesson. In fact, I have become so immune after RGV ki Aag that it would be just another Department to me, if I lose.”

RGV also expressed confidence that at least the film fraternity will stand by him regardless of party affiliations. “I have done favours to most film personalities who are now politicians. For instance, I paid Hema ji a touching tribute by casting Nisha Kothari as Basanti in RGV ki Aag. I cast Rekha ji in Bhoot, and well, who does not know my association with Amit ji? So no question of Jaya ji opposing me either!” he exclaimed. RGV also promised BJP leader Sushma Swaraj an item number in his next movie should her party back him.

Meanwhile, reactions to this development from within political circles have been mixed.

Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh has indicated that he may extend his support to RGV in return for the lead role for his son, Akhilesh, in RGV’s next movie, with Abhishek Bachchan as the supporting actor. Mamata Banerjee, however, did not share Mulayam’s enthusiasm, “Ouee have made it clear ouee are going to support Kalam even if he doesh not contesht the elekshons,” said a defiant Didi.

Congress leader Digvijay Singh had words of encouragement for the director. “I can see in him the same courage I saw in Rahul ji before he led the Congress party to a magnificent show in the UP elections,” said the AICC general secretary. “Although he should have taken the blessings of Soniaji before contesting,” he quickly added.

PA Sangma, on the other hand, has expressed fears that the bipolar contest between him and Pranab da, that he was quite confident of winning, has now turned into a triangular contest, thereby diminishing his chances. “People might regard him more adivasi than me because of his movies ‘Jungle’ and the jungli choreography in his item numbers. It is going to be a close contest,” said the worried leader.

When a fan asked RGV on Twitter on what inspired him to throw his hat in into the Presidential elections, RGV tweeted, “Only thng u cn evr learn frm a mistake is tht u dint realize it ws a mistake until u did it nd hence u will continue 2 make mistakes forevr.”

Ashok Dinda is famous for the massive jumps and leaps he take while delivering a ball. He has always been at top position during his bowling career, his normal bowling style is Right arm over the wicket, 2ndfloor pavilion end.

Dahi Handi last came in news when the Supreme Court in 2016 put the restriction on the height of Dahi Handi pyramid seeing the casualties happened due to it. However Supreme Court’s order was challenged by a Mumbai based Krida Mandal. Since, the courts and citizens are not sure whether it’s a ritual or a sport no decision has been taken yet.

Ashok Dinda, an Indian cricketer, and usually a part of the bottom most teams of IPL table, got into a trouble while playing cricket in his society. Though it was gully cricket match, but Dinda being a professional cricket was all serious and started bowling in his own style. While taking run up, he jumped and accidentally touched the Dahi Handi of the society. Second time he did it with much more strength and not just touched the Dahi Handi but broke it unknowingly. Society president filed an FIR against Ashok Dinda later.It’s not the first time when Ashok Dinda has achieved something accidentally. Once trying to skip a pothole in Mumbai, Ashok Dinda jumped higher than usual and made the world record beating the then existing 2.45 m record.

Whether Dahi Handi is a ritual or a sport is yet to be decided but the Supreme Court’s order to restrict the height of pyramid to 20 feet is for the safety of the participants and should be looked above the religion.",Ashok Dinda mistakenly breaks Dahi Handi of his society while bowling in a gully cricket match,1800,1.444444444

So after Har Ghar Dastak, Munna se Nitish, Twitter pe charcha, get ready to be rocked by Caste Man, starring Nitish Kumar as the eponymous super hero. The latest trick is a leaf out of the successful Kejriwal marketing drive in the run up to the Delhi polls.

Team Nitish point man, Nand Kishore, said the idea was to play to Nitish’s core strength as a champion of caste coalition building. “These BJP leaders have been making insulting remarks about casteism being in Bihar’s DNA and even questioning Nitish’s DNA. Projecting Nitish ji as Caste Man is the perfect riposte,” Kishore said.

Pundits say the latest marketing gimmick could be a stroke of genius. “Every state or society has its pet theme. Commerce resonates with Gujaratis, corruption makes Delhiites bristle, for Biharis, ‘caste’ brings a twinkle to their eyes,” Yogendra Yadav, who now has a lot of time on his hands, patiently explained. “So to project Nitish ji as the superhero of caste alliances, one who knows the caste make up of every mohalla and tolla like the back of his end, who feels the pain and unique needs of every caste, the true father of Mahadalits, the champion of OBCs and EBCs and so on….this could work wonders at the hustings.”

The Nitish marketing team will work overtime to flood every tolla, gram panchayat, and social media site with Caste Man memorabilia and merchandise. “Our goal is have #CasteMan beat the record set by the #MufflerMan trend,” Kishore proclaimed.

Like Kejri, Nitish has also become more active on Twitter and Facebook, showcasing his love for movies and disdain for communalism and upper casteism.

The ‘Un-do’ button of Indian politics; she asks for a rollback first and figures out what it was for next. Whenever the government with a false sense of hope gets something done, she makes sure status-quo is restored.

Alt + Tab: Mulayam Singh

The toggle button in the system, this SP leader has justified his spot like no other. Showing one window one instant, and effortlessly switching it the next is an expertise he has acquired through years of practice.

Whenever the banging on the desk-tops in the parliament gets too loud, this lady with the “Baithjaayein” drones – honed for years – brings sanity back to the screen. Whenever the clutter becomes too much to handle, count on her for the clean up.

Ctrl+Alt+Del: Shiv Sena

Probably the most dangerous combination on the keyboard, this is to be dealt with only under emergency situations, since a ‘shutdown’ is eminent if pressed wrong. However, if dealt with the right way, it will leave you alone without any damage.

F5:Laloo Prasad Yadav

Even the most sedate of circumstances can shape into a laugh riot with just a couple of clicks from the Bihar biggie. Fittingly the ‘refresh’ button in the political landscape.

RANCHI: At least 18 political leaders with significant clout in their respective constituencies have switched parties after being denied assembly poll tickets in Jharkhand - a record in the state's 19-year history.Putting behind their political ideologies, several leaders including three former state Congress chiefs have switched over to rival camps in the run-up to the polls.While Pradeep Kumar Balmachu joined the AJSU Party, which nominated him from Ghatshila seat, Sukhdeo Bhagat moved to the BJP and secured a ticket from Lohardaga . Another ex- Congress chief, Sarfaraz Ahmad, is contesting the polls from Gandey segment on a JMM ticket.Former BJP chief whip Radhakrishna Kishore took everyone by surprise when he joined the AJSU Party to contest the polls from Chhatarpur, which he had won in 2014.Terming the crossovers as ""politics of selfishness"", state Congress spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said, ""These leaders have betrayed common people. They are worse than chameleons. No morality, no principles, no ethics ... Their only objective is to get tickets to satisfy their lust for power.""His BJP counterpart Pratul Shahdeo said the saffron party maintained ""checks and balances"" before taking any leader in its fold and allotting tickets.""Our agenda is nationalism and development. And not all leaders have been given tickets. Former ministers Samresh Singh (who had his own party-Jharkhand Vananchal Congress) and Girinath Singh (ex-RJD member) joined the BJP, but were not given tickets.""Just coming to the party does not guarantee a ticket,"" Shahdeo emphasised.Among others who deserted their parties are ex-RJD MLA Janardhan Paswan, who secured the saffron party's nomination from Chatra seat, and JMM MLA Jai Prakash Bhai Patel, who is in the fray from Mandu on a BJP ticket.Former health minister and Independent MLA Bhanu Pratap Sahi has also joined the BJP to contest the polls on the party's ticket from his sitting constituency Bhawanathpur.JMM General Secretary Suprio Bhattacharya said the ""defectors lacked discipline and ideology"".""What matters to them is personal aspiration and not political ideology. The parties they have joined should think twice before nominating them for assembly polls,"" he said.Those that quit the saffron party, include former minister Baidnath Ram, who pocketed the JMM ticket from Latehar, and sitting MLAs Tala Marandi and Phoolchand Mandal.Marandi quit the saffron party a few days ago to join the AJSU party, which promptly gave him its ticket to contest from the Borio seat, while Mandal secured his JMM nomination from Sindri constituency.Kushwaha Shiv Pujan Mehta, who won the Hussainabad segment as a BSP candidate in 2014, is fighting from the seat on an AJSU Party ticket.Deosharan Bhagat, the chief spokesperson of AJSU Party, said leaders often gave in to pressure from their ""support base"" and switch sides.""This (switching parties) is against the country's democratic ideals. However, some of them take the plunge owing to pressure from their support base.

So I read your speech, the speech that you delivered to the party after your coronation…err…selection after studied deliberation by your peers in the chintan shivir.

Playing favorites with the development of states through the formulation of destructive policies often made without the approval of the states affected, dismissing state governments based on political considerations, subverting private ownership through nationalization, and finally binding industry by magical spools of red-tape of the kind rarely seen outside Communist states. You of course now take credit for unchaining the very dragon your line once bound, credit that rightfully should go to a man, a man from your very party who did try to make things right, imperfectly perhaps. I realize he is an usurper, a historical aberration, a Hemu in the line of Mughals. Hence he must be quietly forgotten and his legacy appropriated.

You say, dear sir, that youths are alienated because they know that politics is not for them. Very true. They know that politics, like the Bollywood movie industry, is a system of concentric rings of walled privilege. It’s easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a normal person, that is one without pedigree or one not willing to kowtow before one with pedigree, to get into politics, at least in the army you command. It’s a culture where people do not respect knowledge but respect position. I am sure you will agree with me on that. After all you said it yourself in your speech.

Except that when you say it, you say it as if that’s not something which is part of your party’s heritage, as if this culture where lineage is respected over and above all is not something that has a direct effect on where you are today.It fills my heart with wonderment, this your almost creator-like detachment. One might assume, hearing this speech and the others you have made, that you are a prince from some distant planet, perhaps the one shown in Prometheus, who flies down in his alien craft, comments on the follies and foibles of the human race before flying back again to the Great Beyond.

Your troubadours would say that you have merit. And that I am, to quote you “being negative, asking Bhaiyya what is your weakness?” No sir. I am asking “What is your strength?” As a matter of fact, I am desperately looking for it. Your voluble foot-soldiers say that you are an inspiration for the nation. Now I am an old man, even though I am quite a bit younger to you. And the way I look at it, and you can call me an outdated fogey, there are only two kind of people who can claim to be inspirations. One are our parents, who through their personal examples, set standards for us to live up to. And the other are great men whose achievements echo through history— a Mahatma Gandhi, a Tagore, a Swami Vivekanand, an Einstein. Which brings me back to the question, what exactly have you done that warrants the label of “inspiration”?

I do something very simple. I look at your record as a legislator. The part that can be measured. Your attendance is 40% in Parliament. In the world of mice and men, an attendance of 40% in college leads to being expelled, in a job leads to a pink slip. In your case, it leads to elevation. Your supporters, of the type that hail your tryst with destiny in words florid, would say that even Tagore never attended school. Didn’t stop him from getting a Nobel.

Point.

And so I ask—what did you do even outside Parliament? In the last few years, the country has been in tumult over corruption and the safety of women. This may be just something I missed but somehow, I could not find you anywhere on the public stage when this was going on. Nowhere did I find you expressing your opinion. Never did I see you taking responsibility, the hallmark, they say, of a true leader.

I know what they will say in response. They will say that you do not speak or act till you are ready. And all these years, you have been preparing yourself, understanding the problems of the people, in the manner children start solving Irodov problems in Class 6 for their IIT exams.

And there itself lies the crux, the very heart of problem.

You need to “understand” the problem of people, just like we need to understand quantum mechanisms.

You need to “understand the problems” because you sir, unlike us, never live these problems.

You are like a scientist observing a specimen, the “aam aadmi”, underneath the microscope, telling your assistant “Make entry in lab note book. Subject responds to stimulus with tremor in knees and shoulder.”

In a way, this is not your fault—growing up with bodyguards it must be difficult to internalize the collective insecurity of those whose bodies are under attack everyday in the streets and in the fields, growing up with an assured future must make it impossible to feel the despair of those that do not have such a guarantee. That is why you need to make an effort to be ordinary; to walk without bodyguards, to shake the hand of a commoner on the street, to stay over at a poor man’s house and break bread. That which is reality for others is for you mere “experience”, in the same way that bungee-jumping and skydiving is for the yuppie, bringing as it does a sense of comforting danger to his otherwise antiseptic life, not to speak of the opportunity to snap Like-magnet photos that look good in Facebook albums.

If I have said more than I am supposed to say, kindly forgive me. Blame it on my age. Or my lack of it. Whatever works.

So congratulations again, dear sir, congratulations. Congratulations for just being you.

NEW DELHI: Former director general (DG) of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) BB Lal and three others linked to the project have said KK Muhammed was part of the team that excavated the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya in 1976-77.“It is a fact that Shri KK Muhammed was there with me when I was excavating the Ram Janmabhoomi area in Ayodhya,” Lal, 98, told TOI in an email.This was in response to a letter by Syed Ali Rizvi, chairman, department of history, Aligarh Muslim University, published in TOI on October 12, in which Rizvi said Muhammed was never part of BB Lal's team. Rizvi was responding to an interview ‘There is no doubt that a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu existed below Babri Masjid ’, in which Muhammed had told TOI that he was the only Muslim archaeologist in the team led by BB Lal which had excavated the Ram Janmabhoomi site in 1976-77.Rizvi countered Muhammed’s claims by saying that the latter’s name did not occur anywhere in the reports filed by BB Lal himself and published in the ASI Annual Reports.However, apart from KK Muhammed himself, Lal and at least three other members of the team have refuted Rizvi’s rebuttal.Ramakant Chaturvedi, who retired as director of Municipal Museum, Gwalior in 2007, said Muhammed had participated in the excavation at Ayodhya in 1976-77 as a trainee. “Muhammed was a student of ASI’s School of Archaeology at Delhi. He was with me,” he said.Giving details of the excavations, Chaturvedi, 75, said they were carried out under a project called Archaeology of Ramayan Sites. The project was led by BB Lal, who was the ASI DG from 1968 to 1972 and director of Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla.Rajnath Kaw, who retired as ASI’s chief photographer in 2005, claimed that Muhammed was not just a part of Lal’s excavation team but also the only Muslim in it. On Muhammed’s name not figuring in the ASI’s Annual Reports, he said it was because the names of the trainees were not included in them but only those of the members of the project.He said Muhammed was a student of the School of Archaeology, which later was renamed Institute of Archaeology and shifted from Delhi to Greater Noida.Ashok Pandey, who retired in 2016 as superintending archaeologist at Bhopal, was Muhammed’s classmate in School of Archaeology. He said Muhammed and 10 other students of the school were part of the team which took part in the excavation at Ayodhya in 1976-77.He said School of Archaeology would admit about 12 candidates for a one-year post-graduate (PG) diploma course in archaeology every year. The classes would commence in September-October. These students would be sent by ASI for two-month training in excavation between December and February every year as excavations generally take place in the winters, he said.Pandey, 63, said it was during this part of the training that they had joined BB Lal for excavation at Ayodhya.",Ram Mandir: KK Muhammed was with me during excavation at Ayodhya: BB Lal,3192,2.224310777

Mashrafe Mortaza and Shakib al Hasan have been dropped from the new central contract list announced by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in three different categories.

The BCB, during a meeting of the Board of Directors on Sunday, finalized a list of 16 players to be included in the national payroll, but only seven of them were offered a contract for both red and white ball cricket which will end on December 31 this year.

The decision to exclude the duo was on expected lines as Mashrafe announced his retirement from ODI captaincy and not to be considered as a regular member of the Bangladesh team while all-rounder Shakib is not considered for fresh contract as he is now facing a two-year ban imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for not reporting corrupt approaches.

The ban on Shakib ends on October 29, 2020, which could also mean that he won’t be able to take part in the T20 World Cup, which starts on October 18.

Along with Mashrafe and Shakib, Imrul Kayes, Abu Hider Rony, Syed Khaled Ahmed, Rubel Hossain and Shadman Islam have also been axed from the previous contract.

Meanwhile, batsman Mahmudullah and pacer Mustafizur Rahman have been axed from the Test contract list and handed only a partial contract for white-ball cricket.

Newly-appointed ODI captain Tamim Iqbal, batsmen Liton Das, Nazmul Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Mithun and spinners Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan were the seven players who got a contract for all formats.

Mominul Haque, who leads the side in Test cricket, spinner Nayeem Hasan, pacers Abu Jayed and Ebadot Hossain were given a contract only for red-ball cricket, while Mahmudullah, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mustafizur Rahman, Afif Hossain and Mohamamd Naim were given contracts only for ODIs.","Mashrafe, Shakib dropped from Bangladesh’s central contract list",1805,2.326869806
3140,0,"The Indian preparations for the ICC T-20 World Cup got a shot in the arm after veteran T-20 specialist bowler and member of the 2007 T-20 World Cup winning squad, Joginder Sharma, visited the nets to give the boys, especially the bowlers, a much needed pep talk.

Recounting his match winning effort in the 2007 World Cup finals, Sharma said it comes down to mental strength rather than skill or guile. “To excel at this level, a bowler doesn’t need to rely on fancy yorkers or bouncers, even rank full tosses and long-hops can yield rewards, provided one is patient and willing to mix it up,” advised Jogi, as Irfan Pathan and Balaji, still licking their wounds from the mauling at the hands of arch-rivals Pakistan in yesterday’s warm-up game, assiduously took notes.

The strictly military medium pacer rubbished the notion that the T-20 format is fast-paced and doesn’t allow a bowler to experiment. “On the contrary, it’s about being patient and playing mind games. In the 2007 finals, the skipper told me: ‘Jogi, we are in a position from where only extremely pedestrian bowling can make us lose. I just want you to bowl your four overs and dismiss that scary Misbah dude if possible cos he can later turn out to be a real pain in the a***.’ So I baited my quarry with patience, feeding him half volleys, full tosses and rank long hops to lull him into complacency. And after he had carted me all over the park, I unleashed my secret weapon – the long hop going drifting down the leg-side. Finally, the dude lost his mind and played that asinine scoop to be snapped up by Sreesanth at deep fine leg, thus instantly popularizing T-20 cricket in India and giving rise to IPL.”

Former Pakistani skipper Misbah- ul-Haq also lavished praise on the veteran bowler, saying, “I still get nightmares of that dismissal, man. Since then, I have a mental block against Indian bowlers and prefer to defend and lose rather than hit out and lose.”

Later, skipper Dhoni paid an emotional tribute to the pacer from Haryana, saying he did for Indian T-20 cricket what Kapil paaji did for Indian ODIs by winning the ’83 ODI Word Cup.

“It was Jogi who taught me that it is not just about winning but winning in style with nail-biting last ball finishes. When the side is comfortably placed and it is very difficult to lose from there, Jogi is the guy to turn to for stretching it to the end. In yesterday’s match, with 22 required of 12 balls, I was confident of another fairy tale last ball finish but Pathan finished it with the first ball of the last over.Chae, wish they would make more blokes like Jogi. I miss him,” said Dhoni before tearfully embracing his former team-mate.",T-20 veteran Joginder Sharma gives pep talk to boys on eve of T-20 World Cup,2670,2.546816479

CHANDIGARH: Haryana constitutes just 2% of the country’s total population but has been contributing around 10% of the total strength of India’s armed forces. However, political parties have given a short shrift to military veterans in the assembly polls slated for October 21. Only six ex-servicemen have been fielded as candidates for the 90-seat state assembly.The state has around one lakh service voters, including members of military and paramilitary forces, who will exercise their franchise in the assembly polls. Around 2.84 lakh retired soldiers and 86,000 widows of former soldiers in the state add to the defence fraternity, making it a strong vote bank. Six Haryana districts — Rohtak, Jhajjar, Charkhi-Dadri, Bhiwani, Rewari and Gurgaon — form the hub of ex-servicemen and serving soldiers.The incumbent BJP has fielded sitting minister Captain Abhimanyu from Narnaund in Hisar and Congress has fielded Maj Nirpender Sangwan from Dadri and Ramkishan Fauji, a former Army jawan from Bawani Khera in Bhiwani district. Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) has fielded Fauji Ramesh Palri, an ex-serviceman from Mahendergarh seat, apart from dismissed BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav from Karnal. Swaraj India has also fielded former Indian Air Force officer Sanjeev Godara from Dadri assembly seat. INLD , which had fielded two ex-servicemen in Lok Sabha polls from Rohtak and Bhiwani, has not fielded any veteran in the state assembly polls.Captain Ajay Yadav, senior Congress leader who used to contest from Rewari, got his son Chiranjeev Rao, son-in-law of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, fielded as the Congress nominee from the constituency this time.According to political experts, such high number of defence sector electors in the state assembly will play a decisive role considering the close fight on some seats. It was only because of the clout of armed forces in the state, BJP had sent Lt Gen D P Vats, a noted ophthalmologist and former director and commandant of prestigious Armed Force Medical College Pune, to Rajya Sabha.The craze of Haryanvis for armed forces has also led the Union government to decide to set up one more Sainik School at Matanhail town of Jhajjar district in Haryana. Already two Sainik Schools are functioning in the state at Kujpura in Karnal and in Rewari. With the setting up of the third school, Haryana would become the country’s only state to have three such schools.","Haryana polls: Parties ignore huge vote bank, just six ex-servicemen in fray",2629,2.092050209

Australia’s Beth Mooney has replaced Shafali Verma at the top of the ICC Women’s T20I Player Rankings for batters after helping her team win the T20 World Cup for the fifth time.

Mooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. Mooney has topped the rankings for the first time, having reached number two in March 2018.

Shafali -- who could score just 2 in Sunday’s final at the MCG, slipped to third position after grabbing the top spot at the end of the league of the tournament while New Zealand’s Suzie Bates remains in second position in the latest update carried out after the knockout stage.

Mooney’s opening partner Alyssa Healy has made a jump of two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semi-final against Australia.

Shafali’s opening partner Smriti Mandhana, who was not in great knick in the just concluded tournament, also slipped by a spot and is currently at the seventh position.

Australia left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen is at a career-best 728 points and fifth place, her best position since a career-best fourth ranking in November 2017. Her team-mates Sophie Molineux and Delissa Kimmince have advanced 10 places each to reach joint-16th and 31st places, respectively.

3143,0,"Days after US immigration officials completed a hat-trick of detaining Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan at American airports, the real reason behind airport authorities’ action has now been revealed.

Apparently the officials were wary that the superstar was coming with a baggage full of DVDs of his latest flick Dilwale to promote the movie again in the country.

The authorities had received intelligence inputs from their Indian counterparts about the strategic movie by Khan. They term the result a success of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s outreach to the US during his latest visit there. One agreement that was reached during his visit was on sharing of sensitive information between the intelligence agencies which would flag any possibility that is detrimental to the security and peace of a country.

Dilwale, the American authorities say, had already troubled many citizens earlier when it was released. Since then the movie and its makers have been on the ‘watch list’ of the immigration officials (no pun intended!).

Shah Rukh Khan, however, isn’t amused and has alleged discrimination against his movie. “If Salman Khan’s Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Bodyguard can be tolerated in the US, why not Dilwale?” asked the frustrated superstar.

One of the immigration officials, on condition of anonymity, hinted there are indeed different yardsticks for different movie stars. “Even we love bhai,” said the official while recounting some of his favourite Salman movies which also included Prem Ratan Dhan Payo.

Hours later Shah Rukh was observed jumping and dancing around in the VIP lounge. Many believed the actor was happy after catching some Pokemons as he claimed on Twitter.

But authorities claimed it was because he was allowed to carry Dilwale DVDs inside the country but on a condition that there would be warning stickers on them, saying “This movie may be harmful to your senses. Viewer’s discretion is required”.

Starting today, Google is planning to use the ever growing statues in the state for the benefit of aam aadmi.

“We have launched our services in Beta stage in Lucknow and we hope to extend these services all over the state once the Indian courts give green signal to Miss Mayawati for completing her statue building projects,” Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Faking News.

Sources inform that a “statue predictor algorithm” designed by Google engineers had estimated that Lucknow would have a Mayawati statue after every hundred feet by the year 2020.

“This is huge! We don’t even expect street lights or traffic signals cropping up at similar rates; nothing could give a sense of direction in the state better than the statues, and that’s why we decided to incorporate them into our services,” Google CEO explained.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kumari Mayawati with statues that would give directions to the lost citizens in the state

The news has brought an early Diwali for Maya’s supporters in the state capital, and even the Chief Minister herself was happy with the announcement.

“We thank Maanniya Google Ji for taking this noble step that will help the poor people in Uttar Pradesh,” Mayawati read out a prepared statement in a press conference. Later her Chief Secretary informed that the government will provide the required data to Google engineers, and the statues would be meticulously numbered in order to make direction-giving easy and accurate.

Government sources inform that the news has excited Behenji so much that she is planning to build a statue of herself that would be the tallest in the world.

“Taller than the Christ the Redeemer and the Statue of Liberty put together,” a government source informed. Faking News learnt that this proposed tallest statue of Mayawati would be called the “Redeemer of Poverty” symbolizing Maya’s constant concern for the poor.

Besides, the statue will have Mayawati holding an elephant in her right arm, instead of the customary torch. “This is to symbolize her power and stature,” explained the source.

This decision, as expected, hasn’t gone down well with the Samajwadi Party leaders who have vowed to demolish the statue once they come back to power, even if that means partnering with the BJP for the demolition, while Congress workers are reportedly working on a “counter offensive”.

The sequence of events hasn’t escaped the notice of BJP patriarch and Margdarshak Mandal leader LK Advani, who has now approached the Olympic medalist to request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fulfill what is known as his lifelong desire, that of becoming the PM.

“For a while now, I had really given up. I had pretty much accepted that my future was confined to calling for meetings of the Margdarshak Mandal and playing Rummy with Murli. But now, after seeing Saina demand her way to a likely award, I have begun to nurse a tinge of hope again,” Advani told The UnReal Times.

The veteran has reportedly promised to blog about every match of Saina, if she agrees to speak to PM Modi about making him the new PM. Sources added that the veteran has also offered to host a special screening of his favorite movie, PK, for the badminton star.

Speculation is rife that the BJP think tank has already offered to create a new post, titled, Pradhaan Margdarshak, to fulfill Advani’s desire. “Why not? When Modiji can keep harping that he is a Pradhaan Sevak and not a Pradhaan Mantri, we can as well create a position called Pradhaan Margdarshak for Advaniji.

However not just stopping at that, the separatists asked Kashmiri Pandits to take a cue from these Valmikis and learn from this incident.

“All this talk of Kashmiri Pandits being extremely attached to their native homes is bullshit. If they really were so desperate to save their homeland and houses, they would not have thought twice before doing what Valmikis did,” veteran separatist Yasin Malik told Faking News.

“In fact these Pandits chose their faith over their homes. For them their religion came first,” he continued.

“And it is because we didn’t want Kashmir to turn into a non-secular place; some of us were forced to drive these communal species out of the valley with heavy heart,” he further claimed.

Yasin’s reaction when asked if he would advise same to Muslims in Gaza.

To further strengthen his claims, Malik pointed to frequent stone pelting incidents that people of his ilk had to unfortunately resort to.

“Our brothers tried to get a response out of them many a times by throwing stones at their houses, windows etc. If they had even little bit of attachment to their property, they would have reacted or revolted, but they didn’t. It further confirmed our doubts that for them religion is more important,” Yasin said.

“In fact we love their property more than they ever loved it,” he said pointing to the number of Kashmiris staying in those houses now.

Separatists however claimed that the offer to come back was still on for Pandits if they mend their ways.

“If they do what Valmikis did in Rampur, that would prove their love for their homeland and we would immediately vacate their houses,” said another separatist cum terrorist Masarat Alam.

“Also it would be the real ghar wapsi,” he chuckled.

The separatists further offered those houses to those 800 Valmikis in case Pandits choose to remain communal.

“We have been hearing that even after embracing Islam, these 800 Valmikis could still be forced to vacate their places. In that case, they can come and live with us in Kashmir in harmony. This proves we are definitely not heartless,” Alam added.","Kashmiri separatists laud 800 Valmikis for converting to Islam, ask Pandits to learn from them",2368,1.731418919

The minute NDTV’s ticker flashed news of the development in the early hours of Sunday, delirious celebrations broke in the 7RCR war room set up a few weeks ago to track the campaign in real time.

“This is the moment we all worked so hard for,” said Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu amidst rapturous applause, even as a teary-eyed Modi group-hugged Rahul Gandhi, Rajdeep Sardesai, Nayantara Sahgal and various other key participants of the operation.

“Where is my star performer?” boomed Modi, breaking off the hug. His gaze swept the room before zeroing in on Raghuram Rajan. “There he is! A round of applause for Raghu!” he exclaimed, prompting another round of cheers.

“If it wasn’t for Raghuram Rajan and to a lesser extent Narayanamurthy joining the rising intolerance campaign, it would not have got the legitimacy it needed. Raghu’s speech in IIT-Delhi calling for tolerance may well have been the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Venkaiah Naidu.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi then took to Twitter to make the announcement. “I congratulate the people of this country for this stupendous achievement. Goes to show that if a nation’s government and its people decide to work together, no goal is out of reach,” he tweeted.

Analysts have hailed the operation as one of the finest examples of public-private-people partnerships. “Good planning, great execution. Full marks to Modi and team,” said writer and analyst Sadanand Dhume. “With this, I hope we can finally put to rest one of the biggest questions befuddling Indians in the 21st century: Why did Saif Ali Khan get the Padma Shri?”

Later in the day, leaders from across India’s political spectrum and eminent intellectuals from a wide range of fields made a beeline to 7RCR to attend the celebratory dinner hosted by Prime Minister. In a moment for the ages, some of the Prime Minister’s staunchest opponents including Sonia Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar gave him a standing ovation as he made his appearance at the party.

“Who said we cannot work with the government? When it comes to the nation’s interests, we can put aside our differences to work with our PM and that is exactly what we have done here,” said Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.

Even Mani Shankar Aiyar grudgingly praised the PM. “Not bad for a chaiwala,” he said generously.","“Rising intolerance” campaign finally meets objective, Saif Ali Khan returns Padma Shri",2647,2.077823952

The policy change has been welcomed by some social sector activists, considering the hardships and high opportunity cost of listening to Rahul Gandhi. “Definitely, listening to his speeches should be included under approved works under NREGA such as digging and filling trenches. They are pointless, thankless, mind-numbing, and ultimately don’t produce any assets for the economy. So why not conflate attendance at Rahul baba’s rallies with the MNREGA program?” reasoned noted economist, John Breeze.

Congress strategists clarified that labourers desperate enough to attend Rahul Gandhi’s rallies will be paid for all the hours of attendance even if Rahul baba turns up late by 3 hours and delivers a 7 minute speech. “We will not skimp on wages. Muster roll records will be meticulously maintained and people will be paid immediately after Rahul leaves,” promised a secretary in the Ministry. Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh has dubbed the move a game changer and coined a new slogan to go with it: “Rahul Gandhi ko sunenge, MNREGA ki majdoori lenge, teen roti khayenge, aur panja par muhar lagayenge.” The Minister was quick to clarify that the scheme will be implemented only in rural areas. “Rahul has given up on urban India. In any case, for those urban youth desperate for work, there is always the eNREGA program,” he noted.

However, many social activists have demanded a 1000% markup over the minimum wage rate considering the hazards involved. “There should be a premium for insult to communities, degeneration into bathos while referring to personal tragedies, and for theatrics like rolling up his sleeves,” demanded leading social worker, Harsh Mander. “Alternatively, they can pay an extra Rs. 100 per person every time Rahul says ‘bhaiyya’. That is also quite equitable.”",Attending Rahul Gandhi rallies to be counted as work under MNREGA,2103,1.949595816

The only team to have not made it to the final of the Indian Premier League, Delhi Capitals (earlier known as Delhi Daredevils) had a good season last year, as they made their way to the knockout phase. With a young Indian group as its core and a couple of seasoned Indians traded in, this season is another chance for them to aim for the title. Shreyas Iyer has a calm head on his shoulder and will be expected to lead from the front yet again. The likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin will bolster the think tank of the franchise.

ALSO READ: IPL 2020 Full Schedule

They have game changers in their ranks and in Ricky Ponting have the perfect man to nurture the talent. Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer and Marcus Stoinis were all bought in the auctions and will add tremendous value to the squad.

Full Squad

Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Jason Roy, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada, Keemo Paul, Mohit Sharma, Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, R Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, Chris Woakes, Rishabh Pant, Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande

Indians to watch out for

Shreyas Iyer

The captain has stormed back into the Indian ODI team and will use that confidence to lead the team from the front. A good IPL season will help him stake claim for a place in the team for the ICC T20 World Cup as well.

Rishabh Pant

Rishabh Pant will be in direct competition with MS Dhoni in this year’s tournament and a good season with both bat and gloves will be necessary for Pant to make his position safe for the ICC T20 World Cup. His confidence has taken a beating due to his iffy form with the bat in international cricket. He though has been a star performer for the Capitals and needs to be the X-factor his team again.

Ajinkya Rahane

With Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan in the team, Rahane might have to warm the bench in the initial phase. But there has always been a question mark on Shaw’s consistency and that is where Rahane can turn out to be a trump card for DC.

Shikhar Dhawan

Shikhar Dhawan made an immediate impact since coming in from Sunrisers Hyderabad and provided consistency at the top of the order for DC. He too needs a big tournament to make his psotion safe in the national team.

Ravichandran Ashwin

Ashwin was traded in from KXIP and the veteran spinner will look to turn the fortunes of a franchise which has historically struggled in the IPL. With Kuldeep Yadav struggling with his form, this could be a crucial tournament for the off spinner if he wants to resurrect his white ball international career

ALSO READ: Delhi Capitals pacer Chris Woakes pulls out of tournament - Report

Overseas players to watch out for:

Kagiso Rabada

Kagiso Rabada is one of the best pacers in the world and he has proven his worth in the IPL time and again. The South African pacer has proven lately that he is a potent force even with the white ball. Pace, accuracy and hostility makes Rabada quite a handful and this is what will enthuse Delhi Capital fans.

Shimron Hetmyer

The hard hitting West Indian had a great tour of India last year and that prompted DC to shell out the millions for him in auction. His IPL record isn’t the best but he is a player who can win a match single handedly. His presence will help lessen the burden of Rishabh Pant down the order.

Sandeep Lamichhane

The young Nepal leg-spinner has been making all the right moves and was good in the limited matches he got last year. He will be a good attacking option for Shreyas Iyer in the middle overs.

3156,0,"In news that is likely to bring cheer to the Congress party, the Film Federation of India (FFI) has announced that German Embassy’s Kal Ho Na Ho starring Congress leader Salman Khurshid will be nominated for the Academy Award for “Best Foreign Language Film”. You can watch the trailer here.

“I am obviously thrilled with this development,” said Salman Khurshid as he flashed V-signs to reporters. “I dedicate this film to the mother of the nation, Soniaji.”

Former External Affairs Minister SM Krishna congratulated Salman Khurshid for the achievement, while simultaneously ruing that Pakistan never proposed making such a video during his term. “Such a video with me and Hina Rabbani Khar would have done magic for Aman ki Asha…” he trailed off, losing himself in dreams yet again.

The BJP has not yet commented about the video, except for Union HRD minister, Smriti Irani, who lambasted Madhu Kishwar for what she termed as an ‘insipid’ cameo in the second half of the video. “If she had put in as much effort as she does while tweeting crap against me, she could have done a much better job in the video,” she said.

According to sources in FFI, the jury had a tough time deciding between Khurshid’s film and another entry that made a strong case for nomination – AAP leader Ashutosh’s live performance on Headlines Today yesterday. “In the end, it was Ashu’s overacting that tilted the scale in favour of Khurshid,” said an FFI official.

While Ashutosh may have lost out to Khurshid, it was a third entity that was the ultimate loser. Marvel’s Avengers 2: The Age of Ultron opened to empty theaters all across India as viewers stayed home to watch Khurshid and Ashutosh on loop. Even Taran Adarsh rated the two videos at 5 stars as against 4.5 stars for Avengers.

Meanwhile, the US embassy is learnt to have approached Sushma Swaraj for a similar production after the US ambassador to India stumbled across a video where Sushmaji breaks into an impromptu jig at a party get-together.

AURANGABAD: “Dhiraj bhaiya cha haat bahari, tyanche kaam bhari, dusrya ummedvarala visrun ja. Apla Dhirajach lai bhari!” (Dhiraj holds a firm position, his work is great, forget other candidates. Dhiraj is the best)Actor-producer Riteish Deshmukh used a dialogue from his popular film to camapaign for his younger brother Dhiraj, who is contesting the assembly election from Latur rural constituency. The son of former chief minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh , has plunged into election campaign mode for his two brothers, who are contesting from adjoining seats in Latur district.Riteish has been drawing huge crowd for his brothers, both Congress party nominees. Riteish’s elder brother Amit is seeking a third term from Latur city, where he faces BJP’s Shailesh Lahoti and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi nominee Raja Maniyar. Dhiraj is pitted against Shiv Sena candidate Sachin Deshmukh.Riteish, his actor wife Genelia and mother Vaishali had joined Amit and Dhiraj and their wives, when the two went to file their nominations. During the campaign, they have been invoking memories of the late chief minister while seeking people’s support. Riteish alone has addressed at least half a dozen rallies in the two constituencies so far and expected to hold a few more for Amit.Addressing a rally in Latur later, Riteish said, “I am from Latur, from Marathwada. I was born here and will die here. We had a tradition of going to the Mahadev Mandir before saheb (Vilasrao) went to file the nomination. Today, we continued the same tradition...You have made Amit bhaiyya... he is capable. He could get the chance to lead in the future. Now is the time to create another leadership in Dhiraj bhaiyya.”At another rally, Riteish urged voters to ensure that the highest lead in the state is from Latur rural constituency. “Amit bhaiyya is working. Dhiraj is also working to take development forward. Each vote counts. Have only one goal — like Arjuna— to elect Dhiraj bhaiyya. This is the legacy of Vilasrao,” he said.Vijaykumar Swami, political observer who has been closely following the electoral politics in Latur, said youths are getting attracted to Riteish and there is big crowd at his rallies.","Actor Riteish Deshmukh raises poll fever, turns crowd puller for his brothers in Latur",2470,2.348178138
3159,0,"Step aside Martian Matt Damon. Jupiterman Rahul Gandhi is here!

In yet another move designed to reshape Rahul Gandhi’s public image, the Nehru Gandhi scion will star in Bollywood’s answer to Ridley Scott’s The Martian, “The Jupiterman”. The movie will be produced by the Congress party, and directed by an yet to be identified A-list director.

Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha, who now has the additional responsibility of tending to Rahul in his vanity van, gave us a glimpse of the storyline. “The movie celebrates the triumph of human ingenuinty over impossible odds, and who better to depict this than Rahul baba!” he gushed.

“The story goes like this: Rahul Gandhi leads a team of astronauts on humanity’s first ever visit to the planet Jupiter to conduct a series of experiments on solving the problems afflicting India’s downtrodden, especially its Dalits. The team of six astronauts land on Jupiter’s surface and begin their experiments. However, a day after they set up their Habitat, a disillusioned Rahul Gandhi announces that he needs to introspect and takes off in an unknown direction. While he’s gone, a storm hits the Habitat and the crew is forced to take off and return to earth, leaving Rahul Gandhi all alone on Jupiter.”

“How Rahul Gandhi faces insurmountable odds on Jupiter and manages to survive and return to earth, forms the rest of the story,” said Jha. “The climactic scene where Rahul figures out the escape velocity of Jupiter and manages to launch from Jupiter’s surface is awesome and will bring tears to the viewers’ eyes!”

Needless to say, the development has sent Congress leaders into a state of delirium, and they have already declared that The Jupiterman will be the highest grossing movie in the history of Bollywood. BJP, on the other hand, has scoffed at these claims, and declared that the movie won’t even make 44 crores.

“I only want to say this about the Editors Guild Of India – that even our own Margdarshak Mandal isn’t half as useless as they are,” the BJP patriarch told The UnReal Times. “Seriously, what do they do? Each time a BJP leader criticizes a journalist, they wake up from hibernation, issue a condemnation to which absolutely no one on earth gives a damn and go back to sleep!”

“I thought we were the most useless organization in the country, until I came across the Editors Guild,” Advani added.

“You won’t believe this, but at least one or two of Murli Manohar Joshi’s and my comments were actually taken seriously by the party leadership. I had posted good reviews of a couple of movies on my blog. Those reviews were taken seriously by some BJP leaders who later came and thanked me for the recommending the movies for viewership. Same with Joshiji, who gave some good tips to Amit bhai the other day, on how to avoid hair loss even at this age. So these alone should dispel any notion of us being useless!”

“Whereas that’s not the case with the Editors Guild. I’m absolutely sure that even they don’t take themselves seriously,” the senior leader added, “I recently heard that a man was admitted to the mental health center by highly concerned family members after he took the Editors Guild’s comments seriously. I’m not the least surprised.”

In a rare show of bipartisanship, the Congress party too agreed with Advani’s remarks. “Ideally, like true politicians, we should pounce on these remarks and hit out at eSushmaji, but it’s too embarrassing even for us to use comments of the Editors Guild, yaar!” said Congress leader Rajeev Shukla.","LK Advani slams Editors Guild, says even BJP’s Margdarshak Mandal isn’t as useless",1864,1.770386266

With the ruling BJP-JD (U) alliance headed for a break-up, animals in Bihar fear RJD’s return to power and a return of the Fodder Scam – which saw billions of rupees meant for animal welfare being siphoned off by corrupt babus and netas, forcing Lalu Yadav to resign as the Chief Minister of Bihar.

Fearing repeat of such scenario, the animals, led by buffaloes, have demanded “Fodder Security Bill” to be passed in Bihar before the current government goes and Lalu Yadav returns to run away with their food.

“We chose buffaloes as they stronger, boneheaded, and have thick skin, and thus can succeed in political maneuverings,” said Bakruddin, a goat.

Bakruddin is not too optimistic about future of politics in Bihar

“They are also seen as pro-RJD,” Bakruddin added.

Bakruddin further revealed that goats like him were the most scared among all the animals in the fast changing political equations of Bihar.

“The government could fall. Many ministers and their nephews could risk losing their jobs, and this may lead to some ministers sacrificing goats to save their jobs,” Bakruddin bared his deepest fears.

“We are most confused and afraid as we are seen as secular animals,” the sacrificial scared goat told Faking News.

Goats are hoping that the buffaloes will help them get this Fodder Security Bill passed and ensure that they don’t die of hunger; though the risk of them dying due to human beings’ hunger for power remains.

“Cows too are a part of this movement and hence we hope that BJP would support Fodder Security Bill,” the goat said.

Donkeys were seen distributing pamphlets among all the animals and birds, asking them to join the movement and secure their future. Hens, ducks, horses, sheep, etc. are already on board, the protesting animals claim.

“No comments,” Bakruddin said when this reporter asked if pigs too were part of the lobby that was pushing for the Fodder Security Bill.

3163,0,"New Delhi: Count Vlad Tepes “the impaler” from Transylvania, properly addressed as Count Dracula, was in city to inaugurate an exhibition on ancient European arts. He had also organized a high-tea and met up with several human rights activists to understand human concerns about vampires.

He assured them continued co-operation from himself and his breed. Later he also addressed a small press conference after the exhibition and high-tea were over.

After sitting quietly at the press conference for a few minutes he finally began in a deep, calm voice, “Welcome everyone to this conference. I apologize if I sound a bit weary. I am actually a bit worn out due to my flight after which I came straight from airport to here. I have just hacked .. apologies .. I meant I have just sacked my personal secretary for this bad itinerary planning. Onboard the flight I did watch some vampire-movies after a long time, as it was a long flight from Frankfurt to New Delhi. The vampire movies these days are just gross, no elegance of old times.”

A generous Count Dracula

“Anyhow I will talk about a couple of important points to you gentlemen. A) vampire rights, B) vampire privileges. Vampire rights and privileges are very crucial these days as our-kind is severely depleted due to a lot of natural and man-made hunters. (Count Dracula also showed a power-point presentation with a data-chart depicting their depleting numbers over the years)”

“So as a minority community we seek protection, harmony and love from our human brothers. As a gesture of love, most of us have stopped biting humans and sucking their blood and have resorted to drinking chemically prepared blood substitutes. This dietary change is affecting our health in a bad way, but that is a sacrifice we are willing to make. In return all we ask is that every vampire be given blood sucking opportunity, once in every few days, say every 3 days. We can negotiate on this number and reach a final number through mutual cooperation but this is an activity which will help us survive as a species,” Count Dracula said.

When asked about his new NGO, count Dracula gave a short-lived smile-like expression and said, “Yes, that is a new non-government organization which I have just registered in Romania to fight for vampire rights. We have also bought some real-estate adjacent to beautiful Danube river and our new plush office is under construction. Having a local branch-office here in India is also on cards, but we are still working on legal paper-work around that. This NGO is also in need for funds and volunteers so you all are welcome to contribute.”

In the middle of the press conference Count Dracula suddenly started coughing loudly and got into a fit of coughs, as smell of garlic tea which was being served at the press conference spread in the whole room. Extremely allergic to garlic he was quickly escorted out of the room into the gallery where he suffered serious burns owing to sudden exposure to sun-light. He was immediately rushed to AIIMS where after a few hours of solitary confinement and self-healing he was declared completely fit by doctors.

While Count Dracula has rejected all offers of News channel panel discussions, he is expected to be holding another high-tea event early next week where he would be meeting several dynasty princes and discuss his views on purity of blood and its impact on policy making.","Count Dracula floats NGO for vampire-rights; wants minority status, blood sucking legalized",3406,2.084556665
3164,0,"Post the election results, with nothing much to do on their hands, Indian politicians have started slamming FIFA for their flawed reservation models for qualifications to the Football World Cup.

With more than 20 seats reserved for the European and American continents, while Africa, Asia and Oceania have to do with just 5, 4.5 and 0.5 slots respectively, Indian politicians have slammed the qualifying process as not inclusive.

Nitish Kumar’s advisor Pavan Varma said, “Every second person in the world is an Asian. 15% of the world’s population is African. So such lower representation for Asia and Africa is not inclusive.” The FIFA president Sepp Blatter has in principle encouraged more reservations for Asia and Africa but is now being blamed in some quarters for playing vote bank politics.

Digvijay Singh asked Sepp Blatter during a press conference: “Why is the representation of Muslim countries so low in the World Cup?”

Nitish Kumar said that the 4.5 seats reserved for Asia are mostly taken up by East Asian and West Asian nations. “We need a Maha backward category for South Asia so that at least one team from here can qualify,” he added.

Meanwhile, BSP supremo Mayawati has criticized FIFA’s decision to transfer Australia from Oceania to Asia. She said Asia is already backward and transferring a first world country like Australia to Asian Football Confederation means that Australia will always qualify from now on at the cost of Asian countries.

The protagonist is an old chai wallah who is frustrated after serving chais from morning to evening to affluent people. The poor chai wallah is highly irritated when people emerge from luxurious cars offer notes of 500 and 1000 to him and ask “Chacha Chuttey kar do”. He sees it as a mockery to his honest profession at the hands of people who have no worth of Gandhi’s ideals or his currency notes.

Tired of large currency notes and the people who flaunt them he climbs to the roof top of an under construction building and calls the RBI Governor to share his ‘Man ki Baat’. He asks the governor to ban 500 and 1000 currency notes from Wednesday onwards. If not, he would detonate bombs kept in Chaipatti dabbas delivered as a Diwali gift by him to all banks in the city. The conversation that ensues is as below:

(Disclaimer: This conversation is in Hindi)

Chai Wallah (CW): Aapke ghar me cockroach aata hai to aap kya karte hai Governor saab.Aap unko paalte nahi maartey hain. Ye dono note kaala dhan ban kar mere ghar ko ganda kar rhae the aur aaj main apna ghar saaf karna chahta hoon.

Gov: Tum ho kaun?

CW: Main wo hu jo apne pocket me itna chiller le kar rakhta hai ki kbhi usse koi 500 ka kbhi 1000 ka chutta karwa leta hai. Main wo hun jo month end hone pe ye sochta hai ki is baar savings account me minimum balance maintain hoga ya nahi, ya is baar IT walo ne kitna tax kaata hoga. Main wo hoon jo mahiney ki aakhri taarikh pe office jata hai to uski biwi har do ghante baad phone kar k puchti hai ki chai pee ki nahi, khana khaya ki nahi. Dar asal wo ye jaan na chahti hai ki salary mili ki nahi.

Main wo bhi hu jo kabhi Credit Card k line me fasta hai, kbhi Aadhar card k. Main wo bhi hoon jo saal me do baar SALE season ka wait krta hai. .Main wo hu jo jab shaan se apne imaandari k two wheeler pe nikalta hai to kbhi Mercedes ko side deta hai, kbhi Fortuner ko. Gaadi koi bhi brand ki ho bewajah side hota mai hi hoon. Bheed to dekhi hogi na aapne. Bheed me se koi bhi working class ko dekh lijiye main wo hoon. I am just a stupid Chai Wallah, sorry common man wanting to equalise everyone’s debts.

Gov: Aaj Achanak Ye Stupid Comman Man Kaise Jag Gaya, wo Bhi 100 kilo chai patti k saath.

CW: Kyun, Jag gaya to taklif ho rahi hai ?? Jindgi bhar ghut – ghut ke marte rahna chahiye tha mujhe…Dusro ko apne saamne amir hote dekhte rehna chahiye tha mujhe .. aur ye achanak nahi hua hai Governor sahab, Yu kahiye ki time nahi mila , fijul k media k uljhano me aur Videsh se kala dhan laane k chakkar me ye kaam jara neglect ho gaya, Lekin der aaye durast aaye.. Wo dono notes aaj hi ban honge…

Gov: Lekin ye do hi kyun? Aur bhi to hain 100 aur 50 k notes?

CW: Bas 100 aur 50 hi to hai humare paas saab inko ban kiya to khayega kya common man.

Gov: Tumhara koi apna kareebi kya tumse jyada rich hai ya jyada badi gaadi hai uske paas jisne tumahre Chai wala hone ka majak udaya?

CW: Kyun..mujhe us din ka wait krna chahiye jab koi apna, mere se jyada paise kama kar mujhe beijjat kar k chala jaaye. Jaan na hi hai to suniye. Ek marwadi tha jo roj mere dukaan pe aata aur 7 rupaye ki ek cutting chai pi k chal jaata. Naam nahi jaanta tha uska bas Udhaar khaatey me uska phone number rakha tha maine aur naam rakha tha Udhaari. Ek din wo ek kaali mercedes me aya aur 1000 ke dus note de kar bola “Chacha udhaar utaar dena aur KEEP THE CHANGE”.

Gov: To tum ye us last k english sentence k badle me kar rhe ho?

CW: Nahi nahi nahi…English me itna weak bhi nahi hoon. I always knew what CHANGE is. After all we brought the CHANGE in 2014. par ye acceptable nahi hai saab..ki koi bhi meri chai dukaan k saamne apne kaale dhan ki kaali gaadi me, kaale suit me aakar, apne kaale dhan k 1000 k note ko futkar kara le. Unhe fakra hai apne badi gaadiyon pe, 1000 aur 500 ki gaddiyon pe, Hawala transactions pe…mujhe fakra hai khud pe..ki main aise logon k 1000 aur 500 ke notes ko ban karwa raha hoon.

Gov: Tum saabit kya karna chahte ho?

CW: Main saabit kuch nahi krna chahta . Governor saab main bas aapko yaad dilana chahta hoon ki people live in poverty by force and not by choice. Aapko kya lagta hai ki jo log kaala dhan rakhte hain wo system se jyada inteligent hai? Arey internet pe ‘how to hide money in India’ search kar k dekhiye, teen sau baawan sites milengi ki kaala dhan kaise chupaye.

Gov: Tumhari ye home made add salt to toothpaste wali philosophy galat hai ..ye sahi tarika nahi hai. ? logon ko time to do.

CW: Haan..lekin aaj main tarikey k baarey me nahi! Natijey k baarey me soch raha hoon. Aap log saksham hai aise logon se niptaara paaney k liye. Par nahi..Why are you not nipping them in the bud. Mujhe yakin hai ki jo us din wo Udhaari apne black money ka note de kar Keep the change bola tha..wo ek bahut bada sawaal tha. Ki hum to aise hi black money hoard kar k amir ban jaayenge…ki tumse1000 aur 500 k futkar maangenge..Tum kya kar loge. Yes! They asked us this question… on a Monday, mocked us on a Tuesday… I am just replying on A Wednesday!

The ODI between India and South Africa on Thursday may be held in an empty stadium due to the coronavirus scare. Around 58 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported so far in the country and the picturesque stadium could wear an empty look as the two teams fight it out in the first game of the three-match series.

Close to 40 per cent of tickets of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium, some 250 km from the state capital -- with a seating capacity of 22,000 -- remained unsold till Wednesday, match organisers told IANS.

The officials said that in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, cricket buffs, largely foreigners, are trying to take precautionary measures by restricting themselves on travelling and attending public gatherings. Leaving the fear of foreigners aside, even the corporate houses in India preferred to give the stadium a miss.

“Hardly two-three corporate boxes have been sold out this time,” said an HPCA functionary. The stadium, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, has 12 corporate boxes, each having a seating capacity of 20 seats. Each box costs around Rs 2,00,000 per match and they were much in demand in all the previous matches, both international and T20.

On Tuesday, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had posted a photo of himself with a face mask before heading for the city.

Match organisers also said that a weather alert, which forecast rains, has further discouraged a large section of Indian fans from witnessing the match. Also the match is not happening on a weekend.

In an attempt to stop rain from playing spoilsport, officials offered their prayers at the Indrunag Temple dedicated to the rain god in the hills overlooking the stadium to appease the gods. Cricket fans too participated in the prayers. A special community kitchen was also organised there.

Manmohan Singh, Director of the meteorological office in Shimla, said widespread rains and thundershowers might occur in the region between March 12 and 13 due to fresh western disturbance over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir.

Incidentally, the last international game at the HPCA Stadium between India and South Africa -- a T20I -- was washed out without a ball being bowled in September 2019.

HPCA media-in charge Mohit Sood told IANS in case of rain, the ground would be ready in less than two hours.

“The drainage system is effective to drain out rainwater. Also we have water soaking machines and a light weight plastic cover for covering the entire ground,” he said.

But members of the hospitality industry have more worries from the weather advisory rather than the coronavirus outbreak.

“Seeing the response of the tourists during the Holi weekend, we expect a good arrival during the ODI too,” said Pankaj Chadha, owner of the McLio restaurant in McLeodganj.

But the weather alert might affect the arrival of the tourists, he said.

“We are keeping our fingers crossed. The last match between India and South Africa was washed out. If this happens again, this venue will be considered jinxed for the Proteas,” Chadha added.

For the players, the HPCA is providing accommodation in the Pavilion complex, which has 32 huts made of imported wood. The Pavilion, overlooking the stadium, is some three kilometres from the stadium.",Coronavirus scare may see India play South Africa in empty Dharamsala stadium,3503,2.31230374

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said.","YES Bank’s Rana Kapoor approved bad loans worth Rs 20,000 crore: ED",3622,2.236333517
3168,0,"Leading super-hero, Batman, was beaten up by Congress workers during Rahul Gandhi’s election rally in eastern UP’s Gorakhpur after party workers mistook the Dark Knight’s fluttering cape for a black flag. A handful of Congress General Secretaries and a Union Cabinet Minister also joined party cadre in raining blows on the caped crusader, revealed eye-witnesses. Batman has suffered a dislocated shoulder and a few scratches on the face but is otherwise okay.

The unfortunate incident has triggered reverberations across UP’s political landscape. UP CM, Mayawati, while denouncing the incident, said “Batman ji may have been targeted because of his dark appearance and this betrays the anti-dalit mindset of the Congress party”.

Mulayam Singh observed that the more deplorable fact was that the Congress workers attacked a member of a minority community. “This puts a question mark on the Congress party’s secular credentials,” roared the Yadav chieftain at an election rally in Bundelkhand.

Even Digvijay Singh was livid; the veteran leader lambasted party workers and colleagues for manhandling Batman without bothering to check his religion first. “Idiots, this is going to cost us dearly in the UP elections. You guys have undone all the hard work I have put in with my quotes over the last 2 years,” thundered Diggy. However, after an aide pointed out that Batman’s alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is a Protestant Christian, Diggy cooled down. “Oh that’s all right then. Saale ko aur maarna chaiye tha,” joked a relieved Diggy.

Meanwhile, Congress workers have defended their actions, alleging that the caped crusader was definitely mocking their leader by attending the rally in that weird garb. “We also did some research about him. Turns out he’s some kind of an anti-corruption vigilante in a city called Gothampur. We don’t rule out his being the head of Gothampur’s IAC chapter with links to the local RSS shakha either,” said Janardhan Trivedi, a local Congress leader who was at the forefront of the assault on the hapless super-hero. “What’s more, he refused to take off his shoes which further fuelled our suspicion,” added Trivedi.

Batman, who is recuperating in Delhi’s AIIMS, is understandably pissed about the whole affair and regrets giving in to his curiosity about Rahul Gandhi’s aam aadmi policies. “I kept pleading with these guys that I was not there to protest but they kept making incomprehensible references to my mother and rained blows on me.

They are instead trying to take political mileage out of the nullification of Article 370 and Isro's efforts. The ruling party leaders are unmindful of the fact that public anger is mounting due to core issues such as agricultural distress and unemployment,"" he said.Rahul kickstarted his poll campaign for the assembly elections in the state from Ausa in Latur. At the start of his address, Rahul took a dig at BJP for its 2014 poll slogan by asking the audience if ""acche din"" had arrived. ""Has unemployment affected you? Have farmers received good returns for their agricultural yield? Have loans of farmers been waived?"" he said to a large audience that had gathered in the hot and humid weather.Referring to the current economic slowdown, the former Congress chief said it was just the beginning of the ""disaster"" ahead. ""The country's economy will be doomed in the next 6-7 months.

Highlights Alessia Bonari post shows the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with coronavirus

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds

Her post has gone extremely viral

Coronavirus has become a huge health threat across the world with the number of people affected going up day after day. In the midst of this, an Italian nurse has shared the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with the virus. Alessia Bonari admits in her post that she’s afraid to go to work and feels tired but will continue to do her job. A selfie of herself that she posted shows her face bruised by the mask she has to wear while working.

“I am a nurse and right now I am facing this medical emergency. I’m afraid too, but not going to go shopping, I’m afraid to go to work,” says the post when translated from Italian. She goes on to list some of the things that worry her on a daily basis during her job.

“I’m afraid because the mask may not adhere well to the face, or I may have accidentally touched myself with dirty gloves, or maybe the lenses do not completely cover my eyes and something may have passed,” she says.

“I am physically tired because the protective devices are bad, the lab coat makes me sweat and once dressed I can no longer go to the bathroom or drink for six hours,” she adds.

The whole thing is taking a toll on her psychologically as well and she isn’t alone in feeling this way. But she adds that this will not stop her or her colleagues to do their work.

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds.

She ends her post by appealing to people to be selfless, safe and protect others during these trying times.

“I can’t afford the luxury of going back to my quarantined house, I have to go to work and do my part. You do yours, I ask you please,” she says.

Bonari’s post has collected over 7.3 lakh likes on Instagram and thousands of comments. People are thanking Bonari and other medical professionals like her who are treating those in need.

“You are an example Alessia, we are all with you. You are angels. Good job,” says a comment when translated from Italian. “Thank you very much for all you do,” says another. “Respect for you and all your colleagues,” reads a third.

Coronavirus has caused 827 deaths in Italy. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, Italy has shut down all stores except pharmacies and food shops.

NEW DELHI: After steering the Lok Janshakti Party for 19 years, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday announced that his son Chirag Paswan has been unanimously chosen as the new party president. The entire episode of passing the baton was smooth as Chirag’s name was proposed by his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and received unanimous support from party leaders including newly elected MP, Prince Raj from Samastipur.Prince is son of late Ramchandra Paswan.Soon after taking charge, two-time MP from Jamui, Chirag said his focus will be to expand the party base and he told mediapersons that he has already written to the BJP leaders identifying six seats it would like to contest as an ally in the upcoming Jharkhand assembly election. The LJP had contested in only one seat in the last election.The decision to name Chirag as president comes ahead of 2020 assembly elections in Bihar. He was credited for his role in the LJP joining NDA in 2014. “Workers have been pressing for young leadership. All MPs have backed the demand. I am confident, he will steer the party in the right direction for delivering justice to poor and downtrodden,” Paswan said.Chirag said though he has been chosen as party chief, but his father would always remain his “national president” and guiding force and he will be in active politics. Paswan, who is a senior minister in Narendra Modi cabinet, said he was relieved from a bigger responsibility and a young leader can tour more to energise the young cadre.Responding how the transfer of leadership was so smooth, Paswan told TOI, “In our family eldest brother is respected like father and it’s his responsibility to take care of all the members in the family. If you take care of everyone, why would there be any problem? I am sure Chirag will follow the value. He appointed Prince as the the Bihar LJP president and took the decision to field Ramchandra’s son from Samastipur. There has never been any difference within our family,” Paswan said.Paswan had founded the LJP in 2000 after splitting from JD(U).",Chirag Paswan unanimously chosen new LJP chief,2225,1.662921348

Punjab’s ruling party Shiromani Akali Dal has accused Kings XI of deliberately defaming Punjab by dominating the last place in the IPL table.

From next IPL, it could just be Kings XI

“This is an attempt by our rivals to defame the state ruled by us. They want to show that Punjab state can’t progress beyond the last spot as long as Badal Government is there. We want to stop this attempt by the outsiders and request BCCI to remove Punjab from this team’s name”, said a SAD spokesperson.

“The team owner is from Himachal, she worked in Bollywood. Why not name it Kings XI Himachal or Kings XI Bollywood; it was named Kings XI Punjab only because they wanted to embarrass Punjabis. It is a huge conspiracy cooked over the last 8 years”, the spokesperson added.

BCCI is currently headed by BJP MP Anurag Thakur, BJP is also part of the ruling coalition in Punjab so most observers believe BCCI will comply with Akali Dal’s demand. However, IPL chairman is Congress MP Rajiv Shukla so many observers believe that Akali Dal’s demand will not be accepted.

Congress has already hit out at Akali Dal over this demand. Congress CM candidate Captain Amarinder Singh said, “Just removing Punjab from Kings XI’s name won’t hide the incompetence of Badal Government. Kings XI’s struggles are a symbol of the failures of the state. If we get a chance, we will change Punjab’s and Kings XI’s fortunes. Look how RCB from Congress ruled Karnataka did in this year’s IPL.”

As everyone ran helter-skelter screaming, “Oh my God, it’s Vivek Oberoi,” he misconstrued their frightened squeals as cries of adulation and posed for photographs with them before security guards swung into action and escorted him outside.

Speaking to The Unreal Times, Hrithik Roshan said, “I am not familiar with quite a few faces here but I gave them the benefit of the doubt assuming they are from the catering service,” he pointed toward Mika Singh and Ameesha Patel and continued, “But not Vivek Oberoi. You cannot forget him easily. My neighborhood grocery shop guy refused to give me credit after the collections of Krrish 3 were made public, and it all happened because of him.”

“But the collections of Krrish 3 can be attributed to a bizarre script and that glittering, silver color consume you forced him to wear,” we tried to reason.

“Not at all. Even I wore costumes in Krrish series, and everyone, other than a few stray dogs, appreciated the look. That’s why we have decided not to have a villain in Krrish 4.”

“Krrish 4? Is the story ever going to end?”

“See, that’s a continuing story. Let me narrate it to you for your understanding.”

We beat a hasty retreat from there but bumped into serial gatecrasher Mika Singh, who has attended almost all the parties happened on planet earth in the past few years. Recently, when Salman Khan hosted Paris Hilton at Balaji Rao’s birthday party, Mika Singh sneaked in as usual; however, things did not turn out quite as he’d expected as, after drinking copious amounts of…umm, water, Salman Khan gifted Mika’s necklace to Ms. Hilton, and all he could manage was a fleeting, strained smile.

Later, the news headline read – “Salman Khan gifts Paris Hilton a diamond studded necklace,” and everyone hailed him for his generosity, although, there was a small mention at the bottom of the page, – “The necklace was originally owned by Mika,” which everyone ignored.

We asked Mika what he was doing at Hrithik’s party and he said, “What else? Partying. No party is complete without Mika Singh,” he made the sign of the horns by extending his index and little fingers when someone interrupted him by saying, “Bhaiya, change the music, no?

Sources close to Lalit Modi, the man who conceptualized the original IPL, said the former BCCI administrator who could be slapped with a life-ban for financial irregularities during his stint as IPL chairman, is working 24/7 on the idea to float a parallel league comprising banned and disgraced cricketers and cricket administrators.

It would have cricketers from across the world — but they have to have the disgraced cricketer tag to qualify for the auction. “While those who have been banned for life would be touted as ICONS, others who have been handed a ban of one, two or five years would be eligible to play for different teams,” said a close aide of Modi.

While Modi will claim the credit for conceptualizing the ‘banned league”, sources said the idea was originally floated by none other than Sreesanth, who along with Ankit Chavan, were banned for life by the BCCI recently. “Since Sreesanth is likely to captain one of the sides, he has agreed to sell the ‘idea credit’ to Modi for a whopping 420 million dollars,” further revealed a source.

Modi, meanwhile, is planning to call a conference of players and umpires who have been named in fixing, spot fixing and other quick-money minting ways.“The conference is aimed at showing the world how big is the number of such players. The success of the meet would help in attracting owners, advertisers and “sleeping partners along with their partner” for the grand event,” said a former BCCI treasurer who had put in papers after the Srinivasan controversy.

The league is a godsend for Pakistan cricket. Players such as Mohd Asif and Salman Butt have not only given their consent to join the league but have promised to bring along a “bunch of talented all-rounders” for the league. “If you can promise money, many from the Pakistan squad may confess to fixing to make themselves available for the new-age league,” claimed a bookie, who is also in touch with Modi.

While disgraced umpire Asad Rauf is learnt to have promised to “raise an army of umpires of his league”, many in India too are keen on approaching Modi to ‘play’ a role in the tournament of cheats. Celebrities such as Raj Kundra and Sanjay Dutt have expressed desire to own a team.

A retired player who went on to become an MP after being banned for life is also contemplating to file an appeal in court for reversal of his acquittal from the ban so that he becomes eligible to own a team. Since only few months are left for his term as MP and there are zero chances of him being elected again, he wishes to return to cricket and fixing.

When approached for comments, BCCI president N Srinivasan said: “I am in a fix. Let me fix my president-ship row and then I will react.”",Lalit Modi set to float BCL – Banned Cricketers League,2817,1.916932907

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party.","As Congress scrambles to save MP govt, buzz grows of internal rift in BJP",3065,1.827079935

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Gandhi, who watched the first episode of the show on Star Plus yesterday, reportedly flung his TV’s remote in frustration. His fury further increased after he realized that he could not switch off his set. It was left to party president Sonia Gandhi to come and press the power button on the TV to switch it off and pacify the 42-year old youth icon. According to sources in 10, Janpath, Gandhi was heard saying – “Dude! Please tell me what Aamir is doing that I have not? He is spending time with affected people and trying to understand their problems and that too from the cushy environs of an air-conditioned studio! I burst my back roaming through villages and slums and, of late, drought-hit areas! Don’t I deserve to be given credit and appreciation for the idea?!”

“This is …what is the word for it? Wait, let me ask Pritam. He hears the word all the time, and he will be able to recollect it in a jiffy,” said Gandhi, who, after a brief telephonic chat with the music director, exclaimed, “Aah yes! Plagiarism! This is blatant plagiarism! The only thing Aamir isn’t doing is sharing daal-chawal with the victims! He has at least not copied that part!”. Gandhi, in a fit of rage, then grabbed a photo of Aamir Khan and tore it to shreds.

Gandhi’s frustration has precipitated uneasiness within party circles as well, with the top brass holding an emergency meeting to discuss punitive action against the show. If rumors are to be believed, Information & Broadcasting minister Ambika Soni will soon be issuing a notice to Star TV to stop the show’s broadcast with immediate effect, unless either of the following conditions are met – a) Rahul Gandhi is paid royalty and given credit for his idea; b) the show is renamed “Shri Rajiv / Indira Gandhi ‘Satyameva Jayatey’ Karyakram”. Union HRD Minister Kapil Sibal also is said to be in talks with social networking websites to censor content including users’ comments about the controversial show.

In a related incident down south, DMK patriarch M.Karunanidhi was aghast on seeing the name “Satyameva JAYAtey” and accused Chief Minister Jayalalitha of wasting her time on TV shows instead of focusing on governance, before he was informed that the show had nothing to do with the AIADMK supremo.

Sources say that a strongly worded memo was sent to all players of Team India which made it clear that no player would be allowed to get any injury once IPL starts.

The big ticket cricketing event will be starting in a few months and BCCI is concerned that several marquee players could miss out not playing few IPL matches. Speaking to Faking News, a highly placed source on the condition of anonymity said,”The the event is spread across two months and we need all players to be fit. Injuries could keep them away from key matches. This will directly affect our TRP.”

“Currently, “Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Hardik Pandya and Rohit Sharma are recovering from respective injuries. And they are all very important part of their IPL teams. With so much effort going into this event, the ultimatum was necessary. At the same time we are aware that some players like KL Rahul will contribute even if they are injured,” he added.

Though no player has given any official response from any player to the memo, sources say that an enthusiastic Rishabh Pant did reply that he’d comply with the BCCI’s request and be in the best of form.

When a BCCI official was contacted about the aforementioned reply, he said, “There is nothing to make of his response. Anyway he won’t be in the team for some time now, so there is no question of him getting injured.”","Get all the injuries you like right now, no injuries allowed once IPL starts: BCCI's ultimatum to players",1494,1.606425703

Reportedly Anoop Katyal was so fed up with PK’s promotion that while flipping through channels, he found only DD Bharati to be not showing anything related to PK.

Anoop then put on his ear plugs, asked his maid to tie his hands on the sofa, and watched the channel for 10 continuous minutes to confirm if DD Bharati was indeed safe enough.

Having found solace in DD Bharati, Anoop took a break and spoke to Faking News.

“I know it is not unusual for Aamir to excessively promote his film, given that he does one film in every 2 years. But this time the entire PK team had gone a bit too far. For a moment, I even thought if they have outsourced job of promoting the film to Rajdeep Sardesai,” Anoop told Faking News.

“It’s not just main actors, but almost everybody from the cast and crew seems to be appearing on TV to promote the film,” he continued

“So much so that, I now know even names of few spot boys of the film,” he added, looking visibly frustrated.

But DD Bharati management and his parents are not complaining. While DD management is expecting a boost in their TRP’s, Anoop’s parents are happy to see their son change himself for good.

“PK’s promotion has turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us. It is heartening to see my son watching an adarshwadi channel instead of the usual MTV, Bindaas etc.,” Anoop’s father argued.

DALTONGANJ: Mounting a blistering attack on the Congress-JMM-RJD alliance in Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday alleged that their ""self-seeking"" past governments were driven by the ""lust for power"" and exploited the mineral-rich state's resources while neglecting its people.He also accused the previous Congress governments at the Centre of procrastinating resolution of the Kashmir tangle and the vexed Ayodhya dispute.""This election is a contest between those who serve and those who loot. The Congress has problems, we have the solutions. They have accusations, we have the report of the work we have done. They have empty promises, we have the proof of development,"" Modi told a poll rally in Daltonganj, his first ahead of the state assembly elections.The Prime Minister asserted the BJP was committed to the five principles of social justice -- stability, good governance, prosperity, respect for all and security.Naxalism flourished under the non-BJP governments due to political instability, he said.""Governments were made through the back door. There were alliances of self-seekers who were driven by the lust for power (satta bhog) and exploited the resources of the state.""They had their eyes on the riches found beneath the surface of the earth and cared little for those living on the earth. How would it then have been possible to give electricity, roads and water to people? Set up industries?"" he said.Modi said it was for the first time since the creation of Jharkhand in the year 2000 that the BJP government led by Raghubar Das had completed its full term.The Das government, he said, worked day and night to end corruption and set up institutional mechanisms for greater transparency in governance. He said the BJP government worked hard to end naxalism and crime.Raising the issue of forest rights of tribals, the Prime Minister asserted,"" The BJP is committed to protecting your right to 'Jal, Jungle, Jameen' (water, forest and land).He said a district mineral fund has been set up by the Centre to ensure that the benefits from resources mined in tribal areas reach the people there. Jharkhand has received Rs 5,000 crore from that fund, the Prime Minister said, adding steps were being taken to fast-track settlement of forest rights claims.Urging people to vote the BJP to power for a second successive term, the Prime Minister said the 'double-engine' growth of Jharkhand became possible because the party was in power both at the Centre and in the state.""We sent funds and brought pressure on the previous BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh for speeding up construction of houses for the poor but to no avail. But since the advent of the Yogi Adityanath government, UP is at the top in building dwellings for the poor,"" he said.Elaborating on the benefits of 'double-engine' growth, the Prime Minister said apart of the gas connection given to poor families under the 'Ujjwala Yojana' by the Centre, the Jharkhand government had provided second gas cylinders to 33 lakh households in the state.Under the 'Kisan Samman Nidhi' scheme, the Jharkhand government has given an additional Rs 25,000 to the targeted beneficiaries apart from the funds made available by the Centre, the Prime Minister said.""The benefits of double-engine growth are many. There is continuity of development ... no political games are played,"" he said.The Prime Minister said states like West Bengal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where BJP's rivals were in power, were not being able to reap the fruits of central government schemes because of impediments created by the state governments.The Prime Minister also raked up the hugely divisive issues of repeal of special status granted to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.""The Congress follows the policy of procrastination so that it can keep collecting votes. The party kept the issue of article 370 pending. We had promised a resolution and we fulfilled it.""The Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya had lingered for decades. The Congress could have resolved it, if it so wanted, but it chose to hurt the society, the country to protect its vote bank. See, today the dispute stands resolved,"" he said.The Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat', asserting unity was in the larger interest of the country.He also recalled how the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had created Jharkhand and set up a ministry to exclusively handle the welfare of tribals.""For 50 years, there was no ministry of tribal affairs to look after the interest of adivasis. There was an OBC commission but it lacked constitutional status. We ensured that constitutional status was bestowed on the Commission,"" Modi said, as he sought to reach out to the vast tribal electorate of Jharkhand.","Congress, allies driven by lust for power: PM Modi at Jharkhand poll rally",5029,2.823622987

Attacking the BJP for trying to stop the mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) in Delhi government schools, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that education should be a part of politics, but one shouldn’t politicise the education system.

Speaking to the media after visiting a school in Rouse Avenue, Kejriwal said that vote should be given to those who provide good education, and not to those who try to create divisions among the people on the basis of religion.

On being told the BJP is criticising the mega PTM and its timing, as Delhi will go to the polls in a few weeks time, the Chief Minister said that this was not the first such meeting.

“If they (the opposition) feel it is a poll gimmick, what can I say. They also tried to stop it. But it is wrong. There should be no politics with education and schooling. However, education should be a part of politics. I don’t understand why they want to stop this,” he told the media.

Delhi government on Saturday organised the mega PTM across all its schools.

Mega PTM in Delhi government schools was launched in July 2016 after the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi a year before. The AAP government claims that it has significantly enhanced parent-teacher interaction and partnership in children’s education.

Kejriwal said the PTM was only a concept in private schools earlier.

“In government schools, this used to happen only on paper. PTM is crucial for students’ growth,” he said.

Apart from Kejriwal, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia also visited schools in the city on Saturday.

“Had a lovely interaction with the parents on the unbelievable heights our children can reach, only if we put unflinching support behind them, irrespective of our own backgrounds,” Sisodia tweeted after the visit.

He said he felt good to see parents being welcomed warmly by the schools and having meaningful conversations with the teachers about education and their children.","Education should be part of politics, says Kejriwal",1991,2.109492717

The former Samajwadi Leader has now been detained in what is being dubbed the ‘Cash for Bail’ case under Section 15(b) of the Indian Penal code for trying to inject black money into the economy.

Amar Singh’s lawyers maintain that their client is completely innocent. “Amar ji, as a matter of good business practice, always conducts transactions involving over Rs.1 crore using cash rather than relying on the inefficient banking system. Surely, a direct cash transfer of Rs. 1 crore is more assuring than a surety for the same amount, isn’t it?” howled Manish Thailyani, Amar Singh’s lawyer, who has promptly applied for bail in this case as well.

The key Congress leaders of the state will be basically confined to four walls of a room in an undisclosed location. They will be devoid of all communications except a hotline with the party headquarters.

Rahul hopes this move will prevent the ongoing defection of the party leaders that included the likes of Himanta Biswa Sarma and Vijay Bahuguna to the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp. According to sources, he also plans to visit the secret room from time to time to have lunch with those leaders like he does with voters during the election campaign.

“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” a Congress worker told The UnReal Times on the condition of anonymity. “This is a proactive measure to stop the leakage of talent from Congress. You see this move should once and for all end the debate on Rahul ji’s leadership.”

The Congress is quite relaxed about leaders using mobile phones from within the room to communicate with the outside world. They’re confident about the poor network connectivity of mobile phones in the remote areas of the state.

“This is the only occasion when we want to thank the Samajwadi Party for the lack of development in the state,” added the Congress worker sarcastically.

The BJP however is not really worried by the Congress’ stealthy move. The party president Amit Shah told The UnReal Times that the Congress leaders interested in joining the BJP need not worry as he can locate them successfully.

“I don’t know where you’re. But I will find you and I will induct you in the BJP,” Shah said as he turned the GPS on in his mobile phone.

VARANASI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday stressed the need to rewrite history from India's perspective, saying had it not been for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , the British portrayal of the 1857 uprising as just a mutiny by Indian sepoys in the East India Company 's army would have still ruled the roost.""It was Savarkar who gave the name first war of Independence to the 1857 'kranti', otherwise our children would have known it as a revolt,"" Shah said. His comments came against the backdrop of BJP's push for a Bharat Ratna for Savarkar, something which has been seen as an ambitious effort to put the Hindutva icon on a pedestal.Shah, who was here to inaugurate a two-day international seminar ""Remembering Guptavanshaik-Veer Skandgupta Vikramaditya and Political Future of India"" at the Banaras Hindu University, said history has always been written by the victor; those who succeed in capturing power.""India never invaded any foreign territory, but we have our own heroes like Skandgupta who defeated the Hunas when they had conquered a large part of Asia and Europe and had seemed invincible. It is unfortunate that our children don't know about the great ruler (Skandgupta) who extended India's boundary from Junagarh to Afghanistan. It is also unfortunate that his merits and contributions are ignored and there are not enough historical references about him,"" Shah said.""It is the responsibility of our historians and people to preserve and rewrite the nation's history. How long will we go on cursing the British saying they did injustice to us? Who is stopping us from rewriting (history)? We should not get into controversies over past writings. Instead, we should write history with our own view,"" he said.It is very important to rewrite the country's history with an Indian point of view. I believe there is no point blaming Left, British or Mughal historians. If our historians cannot ensure that our 200 great personalities and 25 great empires which flourished here get their rightful place in our history, we have to change our vision and rethink our approach,"" he added.Praising Skandgupta's achievements, Shah said, ""Literature, military, culture and art were world class. The country had the best astrologers during the period and India was freed of invaders from Kashmir to Kandahar. We need to include Skandgupta's contribution in our history.""Addressing the historians on the dais and in the audience, the home minister said, ""We don't have to dispute anything, only write the truth and it will stand the test of time."" Shah also praised Madan Mohan Malaviya for founding BHU where ""Hindu dharma and sanskriti are still propagated after so many years"". He praised PM Modi for making India ""regain"" its respect in the world. ""Respect for our country has increased. The world pays attention to our views.

“Agreed, we still have our task cut out in coming up with a plausible line of reasoning crediting Rahul, despite his complete absence from the scene,” gushed Abhishek Manu Singhvi, “but we are highly paid professionals and will do our best. Anyway, it’s a welcome change from shielding him from electoral disasters despite his having a say in everything.”

The win also means more work for some party veterans like AK Antony. “I have this workhorse ‘Clean chit to Rahul for Electoral Disaster’ template where I just change the dates and submit it to the high command after every election. This time I will have to write a new report from scratch, but it’s ok,” Antony confided to The UnReal Times.

However, Antony’s “clean chit for Rahul” template has not lost all its relevance. “Some senior BJP leaders have asked whether they can use it for their internal spin doctoring. I said, ‘Absolutely. Please go ahead.’ It is a very robust template that can be easily adapted to any situation. In their case, they just have to replace ‘Rahul baba’ with ‘Namo’ and it will be good to go,” Antony observed.

LUCKNOW: Ahead of her visit to the SP stronghold Azamgarh where she is likely to meet family members of arrested anti-CAA protestors, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said raising voice in a democracy is not a crime. Her visit also comes in the backdrop of ""missing"" posters of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav surfacing in his parliamentary constituency.The posters had questioned the MP's absence in the wake of police action on women protesting against the CAA here last week.In a tweet in Hindi, Priyanka Gandhi said, ""Raising voice in a democracy is not a crime. And, it is my duty to stand with those, with whom crime has been committed. (Loktantra mein awaaz uthaana julm nahi hai aur mera kartavya hai ki jinke saath julm ho raha hai main unke saath kharhi hoon).""Several Muslim women had staged a protest at Maulana Jauhar Park area here last week against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) but were forcibly removed by police.An FIR was registered against 35 named and over 100 unidentified people involved in the protests.

3196,0,"In a major embarrassment, CNN-IBN has released a statement that its earlier salient ‘State of the Nation’ poll finding that ‘most Indians want Rahul Gandhi to succeed Dr. Manmohan Singh as the PM’ may not have been entirely accurate. Apparently, the questionnaire that had been administered to over 18,000 respondents across India had “Rahul Dravid” instead of “Rahul Gandhi” erroneously printed on it. So the correct inference to now draw is that 42% of Indians want Rahul Dravid to become the next Prime Minister of India, according to CNN-IBN’s press release.

Attempting to put a positive spin on this blooper, a red faced Sagarika Ghose, CNN-IBN’s anchor, said on her popular show “Face the Nation” that “the findings are nevertheless still relevant in the sense that most Indians want a Rahul to become the next PM.” However, CNN-IBN has understandably refrained from analyzing the political implications of its poll findings citing the “Garbage in, Garbage out” principal. Many analysts have nevertheless concluded that this finding, albeit arrived at accidentally, makes perfect sense. “Rahul Dravid is articulate, extremely fit, youthful (editor – by a political, not cricketing yardstick), highly intellectual (he reads a book every night before falling asleep, according to his biographer), arguably more good looking, and capable of taking the attack to the opposition – in summary, a better choice than the Nehru-Gandhi scion,” stated noted political science professor, Dr. Shashank Agashe.

It is likely that the questionnaire design team may have been watching Dravid’s marathon unbeaten innings in the Trentbridge Test when the questionnaire was being finalized which could have led to the typo. A few respondents did point out this glaring error to the survey team but were told to “just fill the form and not act smart” according to a CNN-IBN insider.

When Rahul Dravid was told about the corrected findings, he laughed it off sportingly. “Being captain of the Indian team was tough enough, and now people want me to captain India!! Thanks but no thanks, I’m sure most people saw through the error and must have meant to pick Rahul Gandhi only,” said the Wall to this correspondent over the phone before disconnecting to head off for batting practice.

After careful scrutiny of bowling statistics up to yesterday, Sun Risers Hyderabad’s lanky pacer Ishant Sharma was the first to be handed over the cap by IPL commissioner Rajeev Shukla.

Speaking about the cap, Shukla said, “Arre yaar, this IPL is an ek dum esuperhit, but has also eseen esome of the most ridiculous bowling. In almost every franchise, there are bowlers who are trying to outdo each other when it comes to estupid bowling. That’s why we decided to honour this new esort of competitive espirit by having a new cap. Also, this is the first cap to be named after a cricketer and that honour goes to Ashish Nehra. The cap is called ‘The Ashish Nehra black-blue’ cap and the colors are chosen eso as to indicate the bowler who has been beaten black and blue.”

Shukla said that though the award should have come much earlier, it is better late then never. “I’m sure Ishant’s run will be short-lived. He’s facing the most estiff competition from bowlers like RP Singh and Dinda, who have quite a few matches ahead of them to prove that their bowling esucks. Don’t rule our Piyush Chawla too. But ultimately, all the odds are with Delhi – imagine if they have Agarkar and Nehra playing in the same game. From an inter-franchise battle, it will become a battle within an esingle franchise itself (sic),” Shukla added.

The day ended with Ishant being interviewed by Ravi Shastri, who started off by hollering, “Hyderabad…Baagunnaaraaaa?!” before asking Ishant, “Well, uh, Ishant, tough luck. How did it feel like being taken to the cleaners by CSK?”

“Well uh Ravi, it felt relaxing. Feel much cleaner now,” stuttered Ishant, as he ran through his luxuriant mane.

“What was going through your mind as your approached Dindia’s record of most expensive IPL spell? Any butterflies in the stomach?”

“er..no, only idli-vada.”

“Here is your ‘black and blue’ cap. Have a good one, Ishant,” signed off Ravi, bringing the awkward, cliché laden exchange to abrupt end.

“Thanks, Ravi,” said the lanky pacer as he sported the ‘black and blue’ cap and walked away.

Then mechanically turning towards the cameras, Ravi intoned,” Well ladies and gentleman, we have had a cracker of a match, over 300 runs have been scored and in the end, Yes Bank is the winner…That’s all from the Rajiv Gandhi stadium in Hyderabad.”","IPL constitutes “Ashish Nehra black-blue” cap for most expensive bowling spell, Ishant first owner",2581,2.789616428

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country.",2 PFI members arrested for Delhi violence; 1 of them had fought Assembly polls,2079,1.875901876

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Known for being blessed with one of the most soft, gentle and mellifluous voices leading to a phenomenal career, spanning across 4-5 decades, the veteran singer still met Yadav, seeking tips to further soften his voice.

“All along, I was under the impression that God had blessed me with one of the softest and gentlest voices in the country. But once I began to see Yogiji speaking on TV, I was really put to shame. I even began to feel jealous – Yogiji epitomizes gentleness and softness of voice. No one can beat him. I can, at best, only try humbly, to match his voice quality. So I decided to meet him and seek tips on how to further soften my voice,” SPB told The UnReal Times.

SPB said that the two hit it off really well, citing that Yogendra Yadav preached several lessons to him in morality too. “He was at his sanctimonious best – he said that God creates us all in ways that he deems fit and that it would be wrong of one to seek something that cannot be his. He also advised me to totally avoid singing high-pitched songs, saying that one should never raise his voice under any circumstances. To demonstrate his expertise, he even put his hand on a hot iron and instead of screaming out loud, let out just a gentle moan. He said that one should treat feelings of discomfiture with a very gentle disposition and never react harshly to anything. He is a legend,” a thrilled SPB added, before being scolded gently rebuked by Yadav, who asked him not to lose his calm and serenity.

“Unfortunately, our meeting didn’t end well. Just when I thought I could sit and listen to him all day long, he started off on something called The Idea of India and said that if I voted for Modi, my throat would be on fire. I couldn’t take this beyond a minute and took leave.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party bagging most of the Poorvanchali-dominated assembly constituencies has broken the myth about the migrants from eastern UP and Bihar voting en bloc for one particular party. BJP tried its level best to break into this numerically significant community by highlighting "" Poorvanchali asmita (pride)"", but managed to win only three seats.Most of these migrants, comprising around 40 lakh voters, live in the 1,700-odd unauthorised colonies in the capital. BJP had tried to woo them by offering ownership rights and regularisation of the colonies, but to no avail.Poorvanchalis play a key role in at least 27 assembly segments. The prime areas among the 24 seats that were won by AAP include Burari, Kirari, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar and Uttam Nagar. The three BJP candidates who managed to withstand the ""Kejriwal storm"" are from Rohtas Nagar, Ghonda and Karawal Nagar.The fact that the victors got more than 50% vote share has proven that the Poorvanchali identity is no longer the only factor in play and these migrant communities are much more cosmopolitan than what they were credited for.Dinesh Mohaniya, who won from Sangam Vihar with 64.5% vote share, told TOI that BJP's rhetoric on Poorvanchalis failed and people from UP-Bihar voted for development, shunning regionalism.According to a Lokniti-CSDS 2015 survey, 55% of voters who were natives of Uttar Pradesh and 64% from Bihar and Jharkhand, the highest percentage among all communities, had voted for AAP in the 2015 polls.Ravi Ranjan, a political scientist from Zakir Hussain College, said, ""Compared with other groups, the community doesn't have a common identity marker based on caste, class or link with associations. There are many sub-divisions and their choices and interests are very different, which reflects in the voting pattern.""""Poorvanchalis certainly want identity affinity with candidates, but vote for parties that provide positive results in terms of education, housing, electricity and water, things migrants are deprived of,"" Ranjan said.While AAP fielded 12 Poorvanchali faces, BJP gave tickets to eight such candidates. Political analysts pointed out that the saffron party's decision to go for polls under the leadership of Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari rested on the fact that he was an influential Poorvanchali face. BJP also ceded its seats to JDU and invited Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to rally for it during the campaign. Congress allied with RJD and made Kirti Azad its campaign chief.AAP, however, reaped rich dividends by offering the community basic amenities like water and sewer network, free electricity and subsidies, apart from more Chhath ghats.",Why Poorvanchali card failed for BJP: Migrants want a better life,2875,2.573913043

Limits were crossed when the trailer received negative reviews even on Zomato.

We got hold of Akash Thosar (Male Lead – Sairat) and here’s what he feels about the Hindi adaptation “Ever since I came to know that the movie is being produced by Karan Johar, I was thinking that it would be bad. But when I saw the trailer, I was convinced that it is bad. Did you know that in Sairat, mine and Rinku’s characters were originally not supposed to die in the end? When I heard that KJo is producing the movie, I imagined the lead actress to be a South Bombay girl and the guy to be a Bandra guy. The class divide between upper class and upper-upper class would create tensions between the two. They would elope in the guy’s BMW. They would struggle living in their 3 BHK. And ultimately, the guy would get a job in an MNC due to his hard work of getting referral from someone influential who’s already working there. I knew the story would be similar to what I just narrated since it is being produced by Karan Johar. Now we knew that when Dhadak would release, we would have to be associated with it in one way or the other, for promotions, cameos, etc. We didn’t want to do anything with it. So, me and Rinku (Female Lead – Sairat) requested Nagraj sir (Director – Sairat) to change the storyline to the one where we both die. This way we wouldn’t have any association with Dhadak and we wouldn’t be supposed to watch it. And after seeing the trailer, I am glad that we did that.”

Akash and Rinku have cut every tie with Dhadak and are suing anyone who associates them with it. Let’s just hope that the whole movie is not as bad as one of its dialogues ‘Pappi?

3208,0,"‘But has the potential to be revived, Jon Snow-like, later’

Chennai, June 29: Confirming that the long-running character Ravi Shastri was being slowly killed and by this season finale ‘could be totally removed from the storyline’, the scriptwriters of the entertainment series BCCI have said that ‘as of now the character seems bereft of any potential for fresh drama’.

However, there was also speculation on social media platforms that the whole shindig surrounding the character’s extinction from the series may all be part of a carefully orchestrated larger drama to shore up the falling viewership ratings of the BCCI and the Ravi Shastri character can also be revived, Jon Snow-like, in future seasons.

“One thing about TV series like the BCCI and the Game of Thrones is that — pay careful attention here as we are revealing something core to writing screenplay for such TV shows — there is no need for any logic or sense. Any character can be killed at any point. More importantly, the same can be brought back to life any moment,” the scriptwriters said. “Viewers and voters are same — it doesn’t take much to cheat them”, they added, giving out more insights into the industry.

Of course, the potential killing of Ravi Shastri character in the series may not be much of a surprise for the viewers as there has been enough indications for the same in the way the plot has unfolded this season. The character has just been eased out of many of its roles, including the main one of being the mentor of sorts for the army that fights under the BCCI badge.

Initially, there was much fanfare and interesting theatrics surrounding on how the Ravi Shastri character evolved in the BCCI series. Starting off as a simple foot-soldier, the character, by the dint of its perseverance and dogged spirit, grew up in the ranks and evolved to the top position. But the thing about the character is that there was not one particular shade to it. On occasions, it was determinedly dour. And on another, it was aggressive and cunning on the battle front. It was also luridly fun-loving, not averse to frolic flings.

After it gave up the arms, the Ravi Shastri character was developed into the voice of the BCCI, opining on its behalf and also generally defending the indefensible, a position that the BCCI often found itself in. It was here that the Ravi Shastri character came into its own and developed its now famous tone of bluster and braggadocio, easily identifiable in the background whenever the BCCI army triumphed on the warfront. The character slowly began to get larger than life and even normal words uttered came as though they were bellowed through a megaphone.

“We were no longer in control. the character started to take itself too seriously and play a role beyond that was imagined through the script,” confess the writers of the series. “The popular joust with a rival character Nasser Hussain, though made for riveting television, was also revealing of the character’s chest-thumping belligerence and naked jingoism. It served the BCCI’s plot. But the viewers were getting cynical and disillusioned,” add the scriptwriters.

And when the BCCI series went in for cheap thrills through what was essentially a deus ex machina, the IPL, the Ravi Shastri character began to come across as its voluble impresario. Though the character was coming across as loud and crude, and its lines a series of unimaginative cliches, people kind of lived with it.

And then, out of the blue, the character was further put in charge of being the mentor of the BCCI’s army, a trait that the character was never hinted to have possessed by the writers of the series. It also made it clear that in the BCCI series, anything can be contrived to anything else. Plot twist were no longer a surprise, but the norm. It is when the series began to lose its popular appeal. Also, Ravi Shastri character lost its sheen and was began to be seen as a brassy, abrasive has-been.

In the event, the scriptwriters say that by the season finale the character will be elbowed out completely. “But we reiterate, nobody can write off any character. more so Ravi Shastri’s. More surprise may be in store by the time the next season arrives,” they concluded ambiguously.

The BCCI show, one of the longest-running series, has in the last two seasons run into several problems, and viewers, both here and abroad, have consistently felt shortchanged by the unexpected plot twists and contrived happenings. But as long as the moolah is flowing, the BCCI show will go on — dishing out the same stuff albeit with different characters.

Abhishek Rai, the leader Congress leader who shares his birthday with Modi, has been given one week to explain, failing which he will be expelled from the party.

As per sources, Rahul Gandhi himself caught Abhishek cutting a cake during his visit to Baran, Rajasthan. When the Congress Vice President asked why he was cutting a cake on Narendra Modi’s birthday, Abhishek said that it was his birthday as well.

Rahul Gandhi warned party workers against following the footsteps of Narendra Modi

The explanation failed to satisfy Mr. Gandhi and he issued a show cause notice to Abhishek asking him to explain his actions in detail.

When Faking News contacted Abhishek for his reactions, he said, “Arey yaar, what can I do about my date of birth? I played no part in it, it was my father and mother’s doing. Maybe I will stop celebrating my birthday from next year if it hurts anybody’s sentiments.”

Sources claim that Abhishek plans to go to high command wearing a skullcap and sporting a tilak on the forehead while asking for an apology. However, experts are not convinced that it will work.

One political expert speaking to Faking News said, “Skullcaps and Tilaks are used to fool the masses, not the politicians.”

Experts suggest the beleaguered leader to try other options that are feasible and practical.

“Maybe he could bribe authorities and get his date of birth changed,” an expert suggested, “Or he should declare that he is unborn, as was done by this guy in this Faking News report.”

“Or here it a solution that will definitely work,” the expert added, “This leader should declare his parents as RSS workers, who gave him a bad date of birth.”

Sources confirm that the parents of Abhishek Rai were not RSS workers. In fact, they were committed Congress workers.

“His father was Narsimha Rai, a well known local Congress leader. But given his name, I think he’d soon be disowned to please the high command,” a source told Faking News.",Congress leader issued show cause notice for sharing birthday with Modi,2139,2.01028518

3213,0,"Yoga had gained global prominence and acclaim due to work of gurus like BKS Iyengar. Different schools exist like Iyengar Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Power (?) Yoga, Bikram Yoga etc. On the occasion of International Yoga Day, we identify Yoga schools that you never knew existed. And a couple of new poses too!

Congress School of Yoga

One of the original schools that was really dedicated to well-being of people. Over the last 40 years, the poses have become more worshipful of the family managing the school. All asanas are named after Jawahar, Indira and Rajiv. There is still a good core of asanas, but the members have become more and more interested in the location of centres, money collected as fees etc. Become less effective but still a good school for sons of fathers who were branch heads. Strengthens your left side.

Namo School of Yoga

Be prepared! You need to be dressed very well for the class. The typical class starts with the guru making a moving speech. Then all students have to wish other members happy birthday, anniversary etc. on social media. Then do asanas and then take selfies and post it. After sometime, the teacher will give another moving speech. Every month a festival will happen with nationwide events. Does good advertising on radio, TV etc. A lot of people say that asanas are the same from Congress school, just rebranded. However, these days this school only is selling, especially abroad. Started out as a right side school, but looks left sided with every passing day.

Amma School of Yoga

This is of the Ekalavya variety. Very strong in Tamil Nadu. All followers dress up in white dhoti and shirt. Keep a picture of Amma and do Yoga. No teachers are allowed. Only Suryanamaskar is allowed, but renamed as Ammavanakkam. Don’t think of becoming fit, as the school distributes sweets whenever Amma wins one of her numerous court cases. Need a strong backside, as a member may be kicked up or kicked out anytime.

Bollywood School of Yoga

You don’t need any skill to do this Yoga. Basically keep hyping about some Yoga you are going to do. Watch DVDs of Chinese, Korean, French exercises and repackage them as asanas. Admission restricted to sons and daughters of existing members. Exceptions for good looking foreigners who don’t know Hindi. Every 3 months the school will meet and award each other.

Sachin School of Yoga

Very hard working and committed. Whatever asanas you take up, should be done 100 times. Does not matter if you are tired or more energetic people are waiting. 100 is 100.

AAP School of Yoga

Originally thought to be a refreshing, new branch. Beginning to look more and more like the Amma school now. Has only one asana. All students lie down and start kicking and punching the air. If you ask them, they will say that the teacher is not teaching and they are protesting. The teacher will also be doing the same and blame someone else for doing it. Be prepared. Classes usually happen on the road. Good TV coverage for this Yoga.

Arnab School of Yoga

Actually more of a drama school. No exercise happens. Teacher will get 8 students from different Yoga schools. Then start shouting at their style of Yoga. Before the students demonstrate their asana, the teacher will start shouting at their owner, teacher etc. and ask them to show up. After the teacher has screamed his lungs out, the class disperses. Some students are repeated so much, that they have forgotten their asanas as well as ability to form sentences.

Here are just two asanas that you may not know! One new, one old:

Rahulasana: You don’t have to do anything. Just go into a Yoga camp. When somebody is holding a pose, go to them and say that you can understand their pain and you are their soldier. They will be confused. Then catch another person and do the same. In between make fun of the attire of the Namo School head. Keep going from school to school. Don’t do anything original.

Gowdasana: Wherever you are sitting, just close your eyes and shut down your system in two minutes. Very relaxing.",EXCLUSIVE: Yoga Schools of Indian celebrities,4034,2.602875558

PATNA: BJP national president Amit Shah put to rest on Thursday all speculation about a rift in the Bihar NDA, declaring that the upcoming assembly elections in the state would be fought under the leadership of JD (U) national president and CM Nitish Kumar Shah said the alliance is firm and any bickering was only among lower-level workers.""The alliance between JD(U) and BJP is ""atal (unshakable)"". The NDA will contest the next assembly elections in Bihar under the leadership of Nitishji. Nationally, PM Narendra Modi will continue to lead the coalition,"" Shah had said in an interview to a TV channel.Shah's statement was welcomed by JD(U) functionaries.

""I would like to thank the top eldership of BJP including @AmitShah1 @narendramodi for dispelling the doubts in many people's mind by asserting that next assembly elections in Bihar will be fought under the leadership of @NitishKumar.

3215,0,"Scientists at Bhabha Atomic Research Center have corroborated Arvind Kejriwal’s claim, stating Rahul Gandhi is indeed world’s first known gray-bearded kid, and the reason for his gray beard is electromagnetic radiation.

Further explaining the phenomenon, they said, “Mr. Gandhi has a lot of pent up energy in him to do something for the nation. But as he is not getting enough opportunities, these energies are getting converted into radioactive materials. These materials are constantly emanating from his body and turning his beard gray.”

The center, meanwhile, has made it mandatory for all MPs to display their Aadhar Card details on Twitter to avoid any confusion.

The whole controversy erupted when Indian Railways demolished a slum in Delhi and Rahul Gandhi alleged Kejriwal’s involvement in it, prompting the latter to retort with the historic remark. Though, Kejriwal’s ‘kid’ remark has enough supporting evidence, Rahul Gandhi’s statement cannot be dismissed as baseless either, as no one is fully aware of who is running Delhi, and its functioning is largely a mystery to everyone. Hence, every time something happens in Delhi, a fleeing image of a muffler-clad face flashes through everyone’s mind.

When we contacted Mr. Gandhi, he refuted the claim and whipped out his Aadhar Card from his pocket as proof of age. A piece of paper came out with the card and fell on the ground. He picked it up and said, “They are trying to stifle my voice but I will continue to fight for…women empowerment.” He quickly glanced at the paper from the corner of his eyes and continued, “Is Swachh Bharat working? Is Make in India working? I don’t think so. And if something doesn’t work then what is the point of starting it in the first place? What we need is an anti-corruption drive?”

When we told him that even anti-corruption drives are not working, he roared, “Does that mean we should stop trying?”

Before we could get his reaction on Kejriwal’s remark, we noticed a group of people, with bags on their shoulders, wandering along the road. He immediately pulled them aside and posed for a photograph with them; we obliged. He assured them shelter and rehabilitation and asked them to join him for a dharna outside Jantar Mantar. However, they politely declined his invitation saying they were tourists and had already arranged for shelter in a hotel.

We tried to contact Arvind Kejriwal for another spiteful remark but he was busy solving a complex odd-even number problem and wasn’t available for comment.","Scientists back Kejri’s ‘Rahul is a kid’ claim, say gray beard because of electromagnetic radiation",2515,2.107355865

Sreesanth took to Twitter yesterday and said that he was contemplating applying for Pakistani citizenship if that is on offer.

Speaking exclusively to The UnReal Times, Sreesanth said, ”I was supposed to be born in Pakistan but at last moment God’s messenger forgot the address and dropped me in Kerala. I still grew up to be a replica of a typical Pakistani bowler who could bowl at pace and swing prodigiously. I was also blessed with a temperament like Shoaib Akhtar bhai.

3218,0,"In what can be viewed as a pro-active strategic move to augment its capacity in the clean chits issuing business, the Central Board of Investigation (CBI) has decided to acquire the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for an undisclosed yet substantial amount. The move came after the BCCI appointed two-member panel to probe CSK enthusiast Gurunath Meiyappan and Rajasthan Royals owner Raj Kundra gave them the mother of all clean chits: let alone spotfixing, the committee gave Meiyappan and Kundra the benefit of the doubt even regarding allegations of betting.

Post acquisition, BCCI could be renamed as the Board for Clean Chits in India. Given the structural similarities between the two bodies – both operate in an opaque manner, exempt as they are from the RTI, and both are only accountable to their masters and not the public – the acquisition ought to be smooth, feel business pundits.

The BCCI’s methods have greatly impressed CBI chief Ranjit Sinha who feels his agency has much to learn from the cricket body. “Wow, yaar! I don’t think we ourselves have done anything like this – appointing some people of our own to probe some allegations against our people and then giving a clean chit,” raved the CBI Director. “Also, tactfully not having accepted the resignations of those who had tendered them is another masterstroke! Clearly, these guys have outclassed us in the art. We would benefit greatly by their innovative methods and I’m sure they too would flourish under the tutelage of some of our seasoned officers,” he added.

N Srinivasan has promised to lend BCCI resources to the government in many ongoing probes: the railway board scam, 2G scam, coal block scam to mention a few. “There is an art to issuing clean chits that cannot be easily replicated across organizations. Considering BCCI deals with issues at the intersection of politics, entertainment, business and..ummm…. oh yeah, cricket, we have cutting edge expertise in this regard,” said the soon to be reinstated BCCI President. “Anyway, I don’t have the luxury of having a dummy figure such as MMS to proxy for me so I have to watch my back all the time,” he trailed off.","Impressed with clean chits to Meiyappan and Kundra, CBI to acquire BCCI",2168,2.075645756

The director received approvals from all those Senas, about the story-line, script, dialogues and the midriff coverage of the hero and the heroine, it is learnt by Faking News.

“In India, one man will have an idea. Two men will talk about it and three men will make it a Sena. There is this Sena and that sena and also, a little differently, Sena this and sena that. If an individual indulges in violent crimes, it is illegal and punishable by law. If a Sena indulges in criminal activities, then it’s law and order issue and it becomes the state’s problem. Unless this interpretation changes, we will have many Senas being founded on a daily basis” the director told Faking News.

“In my next period film, I have covered stories from South to North and West to East. I will never know which Sena may be offended for what reason. They will call for my body parts and with the number of Senas present in the country, soon some of them will be forced to name the internal organs. I wanted to avoid this entire ordeal and high drama; have written to all the Senas and received a written approval from their official letter pads. With 160 plus clearances, I am sure I don’t have to worry about seeking police protection for the release of the movie” he revealed further details on the, now infamous, Sena certification.

But now its nazification is complete. Is there any more doubt left now that Amit Shah is Goebbels to Narendra Modi’s Hitler?” When our political correspondent Rajniti Sarkarwalla pointed out that Varun Gandhi was also a Stephenian, Mani Shankar broke down and began to weep.

Many other Congress leaders too were quick to condemn Amit Shah. “BJP should learn from Congress how to treat a Nehru-Gandhi,” AK Antony said. “No matter how much Rahul baba screws up, I’ll always be ready to write a report giving him a clean chit. And these chaps go and dump Varun, who is probably twice as intelligent as Rahul!!” Sushil Kumar Shinde shot a pellet from his air gun to convey his deep sense of disgruntlement while Manish Tewari cleared his throat to spew his soundbite: “In so far as Shri Varun Gandhi is concerned, he has always lent himself well to democratic dispensation in a holistic juxtaposition.”

A section of Congress leaders have now begun a campaign to make Varun Gandhi the new #2 of the Grand Old Party. “Look, the current #2 is lousy and his sister is acting too pricey. We desperately need a Nehru-Gandhi at the helm. So why not dump the Sonia-Rahul duo and have them replaced with Maneka-Varun?” a senior leader close to 10, Janpath reasoned.

The Pakistan based underworld don took this decision after he came to know about the petition by the Bollywood men and women, where secularism was called totally non-negotiable entity unlike corruption, plagiarism, underworld connection, extortion, black money, casting couch etc.

The petition has been signed by the forgotten people of who’s who of Bollywood. Well known filmmakers and signatories to the petition, Mahesh Bhatt or Imitiaz Ali vehemently denied that it was a publicity stunt. They further claimed that all of them were apolitical and much should be read into them liking Fan pages of Congress or AAP on Facebook.

“This time I felt compelled to come out and speak my mind,” said Bhatt who has now spoken and expressed his opinions on all kind of compelling incidents in his and others’ lives.

Dawood getting a tad bit emotional.

Sources tell Faking News that Dawood was particularly impressed and touched with Anand Patwardhan who vociferously defended 1993 Mumbai riots and serial bomb blasts (of which Dawood is prime accused) and called it an outcome of Babri Masjid demolition on Times Now’s Newshour yesterday.

Dawood felt that the industry, which is defending him, needed him at the time when it was under attack from communal fascist forces.

The don who had moved on to Cricket, IPL, and other exciting arenas such as Pakistani economy, will now return to financing Bollywood movies with immediate effect.

“Dawood bhai is so moved by the move that he will even risk funding movies starring Aftab Shivdasani, Mimoh Chakraborty, and will not mind even if he ends up making loses,” a close aide of Dawood told Faking News.

The Bollywood community, which had disappeared like Harman Baweja after Love Story 2050, when Kamal Hassan, one from their own fraternity, was being harassed and pressurized by extremist groups to take off Vishwaroopam from cinema halls, has welcomed Dawood’s gesture and heaped praises on him for showing such generosity.

Riding on high on the success of getting #MufflerMan to trend for a week and fueling a spate of memes, the AAP cyber-cell has pulled off another coup by landing Arvind Kejriwal the plum role of Muffler Man in Krrish 4.

“We were very keen to take the Muffler Man campaign to the next level,” an ebullient Dilip Pandey told The UnReal Times, “by tying up with a superhero franchise. Initially, it was hard going. Nolan was not responding to our Tweets and neither were the folks behind Avengers. Only Goldie Behl was very keen to induct Kejri sir into the Drona pantheon but the AAP high command was understandably not very keen.”

And then Rakesh Roshan himself called, offering Arvind Kejriwal a significant role in Krrish 4 as Muffler Man, sending AAP headquarters into a tizzy.

Roshan said it was an honour to bring an iconic character like Muffler Man to the big screen and promised not to let down the AAP fan base by making a mess of it. “Muffler Man will remain anchored in the AAP ethos,” Roshan said. “His superpowers will include a whooping dry cough that can send a bad guy crashing into a wall, the ability to sniff out corruption, however petty it may be, and X ray vision to see through corrupt people and expose them.” The last superpower will of course provide Roshan’s scriptwriters the pretext for some lurid comedy.

What about the chief villain? Roshan said that again was pretty obvious: “A business mogul who controls 90% of India’s economy, gets Chief Ministers to horse around to entertain his kids, gets Prime Ministers to RT his wife’s utterances, disconnects power and water supply of someone who annoys him, sends back legislative bills for redrafting if he doesn’t like them. His villainy will make Mogambo and Gabbar seem like Barbie dolls. Duggu’s Krrish will team up with Kejri’s Muffler Man to take on this big daddy of all villains and vanquish him and his agents in a cataclysmic climax,” Roshan revealed about the plot.

But is Arvind Kejriwal comfortable playing a reel life hero in addition to a real life hero? Arvind had initially demurred, saying he was an aam aadmi without any aukaat but made a U-turn after Roshan said the script also has an item number featuring Muffler Man, Krrish, Priyanka Chopra and either Deepika or Katrina or even both, budget permitting.

However, Muffler Man will not have a romantic screen interest. Mrs Kejriwal has drawn the red line on that.","AAP, Rakesh Roshan ink deal: Arvind Kejriwal to star as Muffler Man in Krrish 4",2505,1.836327345

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been copied in the petition.

DIDI India, comprising illegal Bangladeshi immigrants mainly from West Bengal and a few from Assam, UP and Bihar, has pleaded in the petition, that they are a minority in India and need adequate representation in one of India’s biggest sporting events. “It pains our hearts to realize that even people from other countries have a quota in the IPL, but we don’t. As a minority in this country, don’t we have a voice? Is India not a secular country under Narendra Modi? It’s about time we had some representation and there’s no greater chance than this – with our own boy Shakib playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders as a foreign player. He needs to be made a domestic player ASAP,” read an excerpt from the petition.

“What does it take to fall under the domestic category as per the IPL rules? Just ID proof? If that’s all that’s necessary, then it’s no problem at all – we can get Shakib an Adhaar card by evening. KKR has already played 2 matches and are at a disadvantage on the account of being forced to use a domestic player as a foreign one, when they can bring in another foreign player in the playing eleven. Not fair at all,” the petition further claimed.

Team owner Shah Rukh Khan, however, said that he’s unaware of the petition and that it doesn’t make a difference to him. “Ehhhh, I don’t come there for the c-c-c-c-c-c-cricket, haan! I come there just to give the flying k-k-k-kisses to the audience and to do the c-c-c-cartwheels when we win! So I don’t know,” SRK told The UnReal Times.

KKR bowling coach Wasim Akram was supportive of the move. “Look hair, if we get Shakib bhai as a domestic plare, we can bring in Pat Cummins to strengthen our balling attack,” Akram said.

IPL governing council chairman Rajeev Shukla said that it was too early to decide on anything. “I will talk to eShakib, eShah Rukh, eSrini Mama and decide,” Shukla was quoted saying.

When the petition began to draw alarming reactions, TMC spokesperson Derek O Brien slammed the reactions, stating that people were making a mountain out of a molehill. Later he excitedly exclaimed, “Yay! If this petition is admitted, it’s a new quiz question for me – who’s the first international player to be considered a domestic player in the IPL? Woohoo!”",Illegal Bangladeshi immigrants demand Shakib Al Hasan be considered domestic player for KKR in IPL,2663,2.553511078
3225,0,"Alarmed by the shrinking talent pool in domestic cricket and poor prospects of unearthing genuine pace bowlers or finding replacements for the aging batting legends, the BCCI has unveiled a radical plan to arrest Indian cricket’s inevitable decline – setting up of a sperm bank with donors exclusively comprising international cricketing greats so that Indian women can also aspire to be proud mothers of 6 foot 6 hulks like Chris Gayle or speed demons like Dale Steyn.

The move comes in the wake of the India A team’s dismal performance in the Caribbean – the batsmen were unable to cope with the pace, while on the bowling front, part time spinner Rohit Sharma ended up the highest wicket-taker ahead of the specialists – forcing the BCCI to implement plans for assembling a team of superheroes to avenge the Indian team’s humiliating losses on overseas tours.

“Clearly, the cupboard is bare as far as talent is concerned. Just like the Indian economy, Indian cricket is in also in urgent need of FDI of another type, namely Caucasian and African genes to diversify the indigenous gene pool,” explained N Srinivasan.

But why even have Indian mothers if the whole idea is to diversify the genetic composition of future Indian cricketers and instead opt for foreign surrogate mothers as well? The wise Srinivasan pointed out the pitfalls of such an over-ambitious move. “It’s necessary that they have some Indianness in them, pa. After all, they have to live in this country, and not be driven crazy by the crowds, heat, traffic jams, no?”

“Look, at best, such selective cross-breeding could produce a desi Curtly Ambrose. At worst, we will end up with yet another Munaf Patel or Venkatesh Prasad. So it’s still a better alternative to the status quo of relying on a pace-attack led by the likes of Munaf to dismiss the opposition twice in Tests,” he reasoned.

Cricketing pundits contend that the BCCI plan has the potential to succeed but formidable barriers still need to be circumvented. “Even assuming the foreign genes dominate, such cricketers will have to overcome adverse environmental and cultural conditions – hellish weather, docile pitches, bad dietary habits – all of which make it tempting to become a harmless off-spinner instead of a fast bowler. And then there is always the danger of getting snapped up by an IPL franchise at an early age for an astronomical sum and stagnating in mediocrity or ending up a bits and pieces player like Ravindra Jadeja,” wrote Ian Chappell in his weekly column, Chappeli’s corner, for The Unreal Times.

Obstacles notwithstanding, the BCCI is planning sperm banks along similar lines to find replacements for legends like Ravi Shastri in the commentary box as well. “Actually, we are trying to clone Ravi bhai. For the sake of Indian cricket commentary’s viability, it is imperative that his genes be passed on intact without any dilution,” disclosed the BCCI President.",BCCI sets up sperm bank of international cricketing greats to diversify Indian cricketing gene pool,2925,1.675213675

This also makes it the biggest ever purchase in IPL history and also the first purchase of non-cricketers.

“Let’s face it; it’s been 8 years now and we’ve never won the IPL even once. The only thing we’ve been priding ourselves on all these years is putting up a valiant, highly committed and dedicated fight for the wooden spoon. And we have the highest success rate in that among all teams. Since we don’t look like we’re going to win ever, we thought we might as well pride ourselves by setting unique records. We just raised the auction bar higher this year, with our shocking purchase of Pawan Negi. That’s when we decided to take our purchasing a notch even higher,” read a statement by franchise owners, the GMR group.

“We brainstormed and came up with more unique ideas – like purchasing non-cricketers. We happened to read the news about Kanye’s and 50 Cent’s debts of $53 million and $28 million each and got in touch with them. They were more than happy to come on board and that’s how things fell into place, giving rise to this $81 million deal. For the batsmen, it’ll be just like facing some more non-Narine bowlers from the North American continent. Which means these two can be thrashed all over the park. If not for anything else, their rapping can at least keep the players spirits up. With this purchase, we’ve set many records. We might not even have a 50 per cent chance of winning, but we at least have 50 cent now,” the statement further read.

“Ooh, I tell ya bros, I ain’t gonna miss this one for nothin. Time for da West to kick some ass in de east! #IPL #DD” (sic) Kanye tweeted, adding exclusive photographs of wife Kim Kardashian treating herself to a basket of hot samosas with IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla. A more optimistic 50 cent expressed his confidence, stating that he would surely perform well. “Dood, our coach’s Rahul Dravid dis time ’round! We got da Wall in da house, maan! There’s no way we ain’t gonna rock dis sh*t!” (sic) the rapper told The UnReal Times.

The GMR group later admitted that they were inspired by the example set by CM Arvind Kejriwal. “We know this is a very odd deal, but this is Delhi we’re talking about – the land of odd and even, as much as it is the land of extravagant expenditures. When our govt can spend INR 520 crore on advertisements, why can’t we spend $81 million on 2 players? It’s not for no reason that we’re called the Daredevils,” the GMR statement concluded.","Delhi Daredevils buys Kanye West and 50 Cent for $81 million, clears their debts",2662,2.592036063
3228,0,"Arvind Kejriwal slammed sections of the mainstream media for projecting an AAP victory in the upcoming Delhi polls, saying he smelled yet another conspiracy to scupper AAP’s prospects. “For the last few months, they have been singing Modi’s praises and gleefully covering AAP’s travails and implosions. Suddenly, over the last few days, they have changed their tunes and are now predicting an AAP victory. It seems that they now want to rob us of our underdog status as well,” Kejriwal snarled.

Manish Sisodia said it was a sign of BJP’s desperation. “Their stings have not worked and now they are getting more desperate. So showing AAP to be in the lead could be a conspiracy to goad sanghis to get off their butts and do some real work the in the final hours while lulling AAP volunteers into a sense of complacency. But we will not fall prey to their machinations,” Sisodia explained the political calculus underlying the latest survey findings.

Yogendra Yadav also appeared perturbed. “There is something more to it than meets the eye,” he patiently explained to The UnReal Times. “The usual pattern is for these corporate controlled surveys to underestimate AAP and for satire sites such as The UnReal Times to then make fun of my internal survey findings. Now they are broadly agreeing with me. I feel very disturbed. Has Ambani had a tiff with Narendra Modi and for a change wants the truth to come out? We can only speculate.”

The trio tried to rally the morale of AAP volunteers by listing a number of ways in which the corporate-sanghi nexus could yet manipulate the electoral process. “Doston, don’t get swayed by their false propaganda and take victory for granted,” Kejriwal exhorted. “EVM tampering, liquor and muscle power, and more stings will come into play. Even a short India-Pakistan war cannot be ruled out a day before polling. So we must be on our guard and never lower our levels of self-righteousness,” he cautioned.","Arvind Kejriwal slams media for showing AAP ahead, says deep rooted conspiracy to hurt AAP’s chances",1944,1.800411523

SKS: Not really. I actually don’t have anything new to say except the three point formula.

FN: Three point formula?

SKS: Yes. 1. Foreign hand. 2. Compensation. 3. We will give a fitting reply

FN: Oh! No wonder the opposition says your response was routine.

FN: It is said you had intelligence reports that a blast would occur in Hyderabad. Why didn’t you take action?

SKS: We took action. Only that we thought it was Hyderabad the city in Pakistan. I even called my counterpart there. Don’t know why he burst into a fit of laughter though.

FN: But shouldn’t the government be alert?

MUMBAI: The BJP is still hoping that the Shiv Sena will join the government but “may even approach the NCP” for support in case its pre-poll ally chooses not to cooperate, a senior BJP cabinet member said on condition of anonymity. The BJP may not stake claim to form the government on Friday if it is not confident of winning the floor test, the cabinet member said.“The BJP leadership has made it clear that if there is no clear majority, we should not attempt to form the government. We know we do not have the numbers. We are still hoping the Sena will come to our rescue. We may even approach the NCP as it had helped us in 2014. If we fail in our experiments, it will not be advisable to stake claim. We do not want an embarrassing situation if the confidence motion is defeated on the floor of the House,” the cabinet member said.The cabinet member said after the October 24 poll results, numerous efforts were to persuade the Sena to join, but there has been no response from their ally. “We feel that the Sena’s demand is unrealistic as, out of 288 seats, it has secured 56 seats against 105 won by BJP,” he said.The cabinet member said the BJP is sure the governor will explore all possibilities for government formation before Saturday.“As per convention, he will have to first invite the single largest party, followed by the second, third and fourth largest parties. After all options are exhausted, he can recommend President’s rule,” he said.","Maharashtra News: Options open, may even approach NCP: Senior BJP minister",1635,1.957186544
3233,0,"On Sunday, October 27, 2013, as the first bomb explosion was reported from Patna railway station, crowds had already gathered in lakhs at the Gandhi Maidan for BJP’s Hunkaar Rally. There was a sea of people at the ground, lakhs were still streaming in and low-intensity bombs were going off at regular intervals. Some politicians were hoping the event would be cancelled. News anchors were screaming “politics over terror”. All of them refused to see a miracle that just took place right in front of their eyes.

Under such fraught circumstances, many were of the opinion that the best course would be to cancel the event. But he did not flinch and resolutely stayed the course. A cancellation may have resulted in greater chaos as the crowd vented its frustration. He calmly addressed the people from the dais. One false move could have triggered a stampede, resulting in widespread havoc.

Character doesn’t develop in a crisis, it reveals it. He demonstrated extraordinary calm under fire. Such strong self control doesn’t come from weak leaders and pretenders. Such people are the ones you can trust your country’s security with. His relationship with the Bihar CM had deteriorated over ideological differences and approach. Yet, he had had the grace to call him a friend, a reflection of his political maturity.

His calmness and jovial mood at the gathering reassured 120 crore Indians that they were safe. Not one media person or politician highlighted his phenomenal courage in the face of calamity. What the country really saw was a miracle at the music launch of Rajjo. As a responsible Home Minister, he refused to postpone inaugurating a function that sought to promote India’s soft power just because there were some chota-mota explosions in some state capital.

Please move over Dr. Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi. Sushil Kumar Shinde is the true inheritor to the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

3234,0,"Aamir Khan’s debut television show ‘Satyamev Jayate’ has everyone raving about it, from celebrities, politicians, intellectuals to the aam aadmi. The show’s incredible popularity, however, has led to much heartache for some of India’s top television news anchors. Four of them – Rajdeep Sardesai, Sagarika Ghose, Barkha Dutt and Arnab Goswami – met up at a posh bar in South Delhi to drown their ‘gham’ in some whiskey and rum at the recent turn of events.

Rajdeep Sardesai (takes a long swig of Old Monk directly from the bottle): Three decades of hardcore effort to make a name as a journalist… what’s the f**king point. This guy just does a couple of shows, and he’s already being branded as a pioneer, social reformer, top journalist and what not!

Barkha Dutt: Seriously yaa

Rajdeep Sardesai (takes another long swig from the bottle): For three years, I have poured my heart and soul into my ‘Gnite’ tweets to accumulate 450 thousand followers. And this guy just lands on Twitter, makes a measly 88 tweets and gets 2 million followers.

Barkha Dutt: I swear yaa. Chee, the audience is so fickle.

Rajdeep Sardesai (attempts to drink again from the bottle, realizes that it’s empty, and flings it out of the window in frustration): The guy’s got everything going for him yaar! He’s getting more kudos than me, getting more TRPs than me, and definitely making a lot more money than me.

Sagarika Ghose (quietly): He’s a lot cuter too.

Rajdeep glares at his wife and screams ‘GNITE’. Meanwhile, Arnab, who had been fidgeting uncomfortably all this while, slams down his glass on the table in utter outrage.

Arnab Goswami (screams): Why is Aamir better than me? The nation deserves an answer, Rajpdeep Sardesai. I demand an answer!

Rajdeep Sardesai: Abe chup kar yaar. Yahan bhi mat paka!

Barkha Dutt: Yeah seriously Arnab, shut up. It is because of drama queens like you that we journalists get a bad name!

Arnab Goswami (shakes his head with a complex expression combining deep disappointment and mock outrage in the ratio 73:27): Miss Barkha Dutt, how can you say that Miss Barkha Dutt. What about the Radia tapes, Miss Barkha Dutt? The nation is still waiting for an answer!

Sagarika Ghose: Barkha, he’s right you know. You did make a boo-boo there.

Barkha Dutt (furious): How dare you level such accusations against me?? I’ll file a case against all of you. I’ll get all your blogs and twitter accounts taken offline! (turns to Sagarika) And madam, if you hadn’t tried to pass off a recorded show as a live event, people would take us a little more seriously. And those dumb ‘Face The Nation’ SMS polls? Uff!

Sagarika Ghose (springs up from her seat in anger): Hey, say whatever you want about me. But don’t you say a word against my beloved FTN SMS polls!

The two journalists bicker with each other, shouting at their top of their voices. The resulting cacophony makes Arnab Goswami very restless, and his face rapidly takes on an expression of mild annoyance combined with disappointment. He keeps saying ‘Please don’t speak out of turn, Miss Barkha Dutt… Wait for your turn Miss Sagarika Ghose… let her speak Miss Barkha Dutt… let her voice her opinion first and then you can retort…’ and so on. Rajdeep meanwhile has popped open another bottle of Old Monk and dictates a tweet on his iPad: “Stars behaving like journos who in turn are behaving like netas. What is the nation coming to? Gnite.” The noisiness reaches a crescendo and Arnab interrupts to say, ‘Let us take a commercial break here. Don’t go away.’ Everyone instantly calms down. After 5 minutes of pin-drop silence…

Rajdeep Sardesai: Okay, let’s think about this calmly. Why is his show so successful? Is it because he’s such a huge star?

Barkha Dutt: Umm…well, I am a huge star too (Sagarika coughs loudly) So, that can’t be it. Could it be because he engages the viewers by seeking their opinions through SMS polls?

Sagarika Ghose: No, no SMS poll beats FTN’s world class SMS poll (Barkha coughs loudly). Aamir shamelessly lifted it from my show. But anyway, that can’t be the reason.

Arnab Goswami: I think it’s because he brings a lot of pathos into the show. People are crying. This episode, even Aamir Khan cried. I’m surely going to try crying in my next episode of Newshour, probably after a quote from Renuka Choudhry.

Sagarika Ghose: Hey, I can cry too. Let me show you guys…

Sagarika adjusts her hair, puts on some bright green lipstick and gives an impromptu performance as an FTN anchor.”Today the burning question on the minds of every Indian is, why did Sachin change his hairstyle? Does it reflect a change in priorities towards cricket? Does this hairstyle suit his personality? And will he continue to go with this hairstyle?” she says, and all of a sudden starts wailing – shedding copious tears and blowing her nose into a large hanky. Rajdeep Sardesai slaps his forehead. The others ignore her.

Rajdeep Sardesai (suddenly sits up straight in his chair as if something brilliant just struck him): Is Aamir’s secret just good old, solid, evidence and research based journalism? Could that be the reason why it’s so appealing?

The journalists look at each other’s faces for a second, pondering over this possibility.

All four (together): Naaah!

Barkha Dutt: Impossible yaa.

Sagarika Ghose: That’s quite silly honey.

Rajdeep Sardesai (with a resigned look): Yeah yeah, no way. My bad.

Arnab Goswami: Perhaps it’s just beginner’s luck.

Barkha Dutt: You know Arnab that may be the first sensible thing you have said all evening!

Sagarika Ghose: Guys, I know exactly how to resolve this. Let’s take an SMS poll! Here we go… Why is Aamir Khan’s show better than any of ours? The options are A: He’s got more star power than us B: He is a better journalist C: He can act better than us D: It’s just dumb luck. SMS your replies to 999348488!

Everyone fiddles with their mobile phones. After a few seconds…

Sagarika Ghose (gleefully): And the nation has spoken! A whopping 100% of the respondents have said that it’s just dumb luck and it’s only a matter of time before he runs out of it.

The four journalists laugh heartily and high-five each other. They finish their drinks, and rush back to their respective studios to dissect the top news of the day for the prime time slot.

3235,0,"In a sensational development on Friday, British Airways channeled their inner Maria Sharapova and dared ask Sachin his full name. As if this was not bad enough, they even failed to confirm the wait listed tickets of Sachin’s family member and mis-tagged his luggage.

Sachin’s fans back home were understandably shocked and angry with the treatment meted out to the God of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, more so because it happened during Diwali when Hindus worship their Gods with devotion. Sachin Tendulkar, known for keeping his composure and calm demeanour even when facing Aussie bowlers was himself infuriated and took to Twitter saying he will never travel again by British Airways.

However, Arvind Kejriwal found a scam here. He has blamed Modi’s visit to Great Britain for this behaviour by the airline. Kejriwal was quoted as saying, ”Modiji has gone to UK to strengthen our relations. Is this the way to do it? British Airways is harassing our little master. I mean why does someone from Britain not ask what is the full name of Narendra Modi’s estranged wife instead? This is a scam by Modi govt to defame the only Indian who is more popular in Britain than himself. By insulting Sachin, Modi wants to establish himself as the most famous Indian overseas. But I want to tell Modiji that Sachin’s record overseas is still better than your record!”

An infuriated Kejriwal then tweeted, ”We welcome Sachin sir to come and play All Stars Cricket league in Delhi. We will offer the best blue line buses to Sachin and make sure his luggage is delivered to appropriate hands!”

But Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has come a long way since then, having extensively used social media to reach out in recent times, more so, ahead of the upcoming Bihar elections. Taking his new-found love for social media to the next level after a detailed meeting with his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister is expected to start tweeting movie reviews soon.

“It was great meeting Arvindji and being a new generation Chief Minister, one very important piece of advice he gave me was to watch every god damn movie in town and rave about it on Twitter. So that’s exactly what I’m going to do hereafter. And what’s more – buoyed by the success of my #AskNitish live chats on Twitter, I will start another set of periodic sessions for film directors too – they can ask me specific questions on what I felt about their films. And I will answer them with all honesty,” the Bihar CM told The UnReal Times. “I will soon send an open letter to Sajid Khan, for insulting the sensibilities of not just Biharis, but all Indians,” Nitish added.

“My team is busy sorting out a selection of recent movies and classifying them into awesome, maha-awesome and hyper maha-awesome movies. I’ve also asked them to sort movies according to hero – so that when I go to watch Khan movies or Nawazuddin Siddiqui movies, I can sport a skull cap,” Nitish explained.

The Samajwadi Party has appreciated Nitish’s decision, with UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav pledging all support. “I’m more than willing to provide my Janata Parivaar buddy download links of all the latest hit movies,” Yadav said.

While the BJP lashed out at the Chief Minister for wasting his time in watching movies instead of using every hour towards working for the welfare of the state, Nitish found strong support from the quarters of good friend and BJP MP Shatrugan Sinha. “I think it’s much ado about nothing. All I have to tell my brothers in the BJP is 1 word - Khamosh! Nitish is as human as any of us and there’s nothing wrong if he watches movies. I look forward to hosting a screening of Sona’s (Sonakshi) next movie for him, whenever it releases,” Sinha told The UnReal Times.",Arvind Kejriwal impact: Nitish Kumar to soon start tweeting movie reviews after meeting him,2263,1.900132567

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra BJP's core committee met on Sunday after the governor invited it to form government, senior party leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, but did not divulge what transpired at the meeting.He said they would hold another round of discussions later in the day following which a decision would be taken.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Saturday evening asked the BJP, the single largest party in the new assembly, to ""indicate the willingness and ability"" to form government.The BJP's core committee, comprising caretaker chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , state unit head Chandrakant Patil, and senior leaders Girish Mahajan, Sudhir Mungantiwar, Ashish Shelar and Pankaja Munde, met at 11 am on Sunday to decide the future course of action, Mungantiwar told reporters.Without giving any details of what was discussed in the meeting, he said, ""The BJP will hold another round of meeting at 4 pm today following which we will communicate our decision to the governor and also make it public.""The BJP won 105 seats in the October 21 elections, while the majority mark in the 288-member Assembly is 145.

3239,0,"BJP’s internal troubles continue to boil over with Shri Arun Jaitley’s pet dog, Tommy, also boycotting a key public meeting along with senior leaders L K Advani and Sushma Swaraj. Tommy’s absence from the party’s Mumbai rally indicates that he or his master or both are probably upset with Nitin Gadkari getting a second term as party president, according to pundits.

The tickers of paid mainstream news channels like CNN-IBN, NDTV, Times Now and Star News were constantly seen flashing messages such as “All not well within the BJP? – Jaitley’s pet dog skips BJP rally”, “Major setback for the BJP : Jaitley’s dog misses rally”, “BJP crisis worsens: Jaitley’s dog too, upset with Gadkari’s extension”, “Jaitley’s dog scared of Modi ? – Tommy misses BJP rally.”

Social activist Teesta Setalvad was quick to react to the news, saying “Of course, Tommy’s scared of Modi. After 2002, who wouldn’t be?”

Tommy has been summoned to tonight’s episode of Times Now’s The NewsHour Debate with Arnab Goswami, to explain why he skipped the all important meet. The canine will be a panelist alongside the likes of Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari, Hindustan Times editor Vinod Sharma, former cricketer Rohan Gavaskar and parliamentary affairs minister Rajeev Shukla. Sensing high TRP’s for the episode, Tommy has also been invited to a tete-a-tete on CNN-IBN’s Face The Nation with Sagarika Ghose. “Should Tommy have attended the BJP rally? Watch Tommy answer on FTN tonight,” tweeted Ghose, before following it up with another tweet, “All excited to have a feline for the first time on my show!” Following a barrage of mocking and ridiculing tweets, Ghose quickly tweeted,”Okay okay, canine it is! Cheerio folks!”

NDTV’s Nidhi Razdan has also requested the channel to increase the size of Tommy’s screen and reduce the screen sizes of the other panelists, so that viewers get to see the “larger picture”. However, BJP officials have completely denied reports of Tommy being upset. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “Tommy is not upset with Gadkari. He already had a prior appointment in the evening with his vet. So he couldn’t make it.” However, the speculation ended with Jaitley himself finally coming forward and rubbishing such reports,by stating, “What nonsense! Tommy was never going to attend the rally in the first place!” and assuring the nation that though there are “differences of opinion”, everything is fine within the party circles and it is a truly democratic party.

3240,0,"Former UP Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s unbelievable somersault move to the Bharatiya Janata Party was no shock for the Congress, unlike what the media has reported. According to the party, it was a deliberately planned move formulated by their poll strategist Prashant Kishor.

“Trust Prashant bhai to come up with strategies never seen before in Indian politics. Be it the Chai pe charcha program of PM Modi, the Bihari vs Bahari campaign of Nitish Kumar, or the Khaat sabha program of Rahul baba, he’s always come up with something out of the box. And this latest strategy of placing Ritaji in the BJP for this poll season is another testimony to his awesomeness. This strategy will prove to be an amazing success and I hereby declare that all of Prashant bhai‘s ₹12 meals in future will be on me,” UPCC chief Raj Babbar told The UnReal Times.

Explaining further on why this is such a clever move, Babbar said, “See, until yesterday, absolutely no one was listening to us. No matter what we used to say, all our statements fell on deaf ears. Only the khoon ki dalaali remark made some news waves. But now, with Ritaji joining the BJP, the whole of Twitter will have field days for the next few days digging out old tweets of hers and amplifying them all over. Her old tweets will generate such a buzz that our message will be communicated to people more effectively than ever before. He is truly the Kishore Kumar of election strategies.”

Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha stated confidently that the move would hardly matter to the party. “We always have Shatrugan Sinha in the BJP to compensate for the absence of Ritaji, so that’s hardly anything to worry about. What is more worrisome is that in 2002…” Jha stated before The UnReal Times reporter moved away.

BJP sources, have, however, played down the strategy. “Kishor thinks he’s done something extraordinary by sending Ritaben here. What do you think Rahul baba is still doing in the Congress party?” winked BJP president Amit Shah. “Ritaben should do well in the BJP. We’re the party that has, after all, accommodated even Sreesanth and Powerstar Dr. Srinivasan. Should she mess things up for us in any way, our Marg Darshak Mandal is always open for another Joshi,” Shah smiled.

The leader has been given a very warm welcome by her new party thus far. While MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan officially welcomed Joshi to the party with a congratulatory message, Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel formally sealed her induction into the party with a high-definition selfie. “The only thing we’re waiting for, before Ritaben formally begins her work, is an official acronym expansion of RITA by Modiji.

Saurashtra vs Bengal: Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi’s strong partnership has brought Bengal right back in the game. Anustup who remained unbeaten on 58 led the way for Bengal in the final session along Arnab Nadi (28*) as the visitors ended Day 4 at 354 for 6, trailing Saurashtra by 71 runs Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra in Rajkot. Earlier, Saha rode his luck to reach his fifty at the stroke of lunch while Chatterjee reached his fifty off 154 balls on early in the morning session. Overnight batsmen Chatterjee and Saha have done a good job after resuming the day at 134/3. They will have to continue the good work in order to get past Saurashtra’s first innings total of 425.

17:00 hrs: STUMPS AT DAY 4! Bengal have reached 354 for 6, trail Saurashtra by 71 runs. Anustup Majumdar (58*) and Arnab Nandi (28*) will resume their quest of taking the lead and dare we say, even the Ranji Trophy title tomorrow at Rajkot.

16:52 hrs: FOUR! Brilliant cover drive from Anustup Majumdar. This man can do no wrong now. A full and wide delivery from Unadkat, Manjumdar gets a good stride in and just strokes it throught the gap. The partnership is now 90 between Anustup and Nandi.

16:49 hrs: Now Arnab Nandi is down! He has been hit on the hands by an Unadkat delivery that bounced awkwardly. We have another stoppage in play.

16:44 hrs: Anustup has hurt himself! The physios are out there to attend him. Doesn’t look like a serious injury. he was hit on the hands.

16:35 hrs: FOUR! Brilliant use of the feet by Anustup Majumdar and he strokes it through the mid-wicket region for a boundary that brings up his fifty, what an innings it has been, the crisis man for Bengal is standing up again.

16:27 hrs: Back-to-back boundaries! The first one from Anustup Majumdar’s bat, the next was byes but Bengal will take both of them gleefully. The deficit is under 100 now, this has turned out to be a brilliant partnership for Bengal. The Saurashtra bowlers now feeling the heat.

16:24 hrs: Maiden from Prerak! A much needed one from Saurashtra’s point of view. Bengal had got far too many free boundaries in the last 5 overs.

16:15 hrs: FOUR! Pitched up from Prerak, Nandi clears his front leg and whips it for a boundary. That brings up the fifty-run partnership between Nandi and Anustup.

16:01 hrs: 2 boundaries but nothing from the bat. 4 byes, not once but two times in the same over from Jaydev Unadkat. Nothing much the keeper could have done to stop those. Some free runs for Bengal.

15:23 hrs: Partnership building. Nandi and Majumdar are building a partnership after Tea. This is the last recognised batting pair and they need to stick it out in the middle all the time.

15:00 hrs: Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi resume innings after Tea. Bengal will hope to get closer to the opponent’s first innings score.

14:45 hrs: Tea! At the end of second session, Bengal have posted 264/6. They are still 161 runs behind Saurashtra’s first innings total. Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi are at the crease.

14:30 hrs: OUT! Chetan Sakariya picks his first wicket of the day as he gets rid of Shahbaz Ahmed for 16. The ball straightened up a bit and the angle of the batsman failed to read the angle of the delivery. Bengal are six down now.

14:12 hrs: Shahbaz Ahmed and Anustup Majumdar hit one boundary each off Chetan Sakariya in one over. Benga need these two to build a partnership to bail them out of trouble.

13:59 hrs: OUT! Prerak Mankad strikes for Saurashtra and Wriddhiman Saha is castled! This is a huge wicket for them as Saha was looking dangerous and this can be the beginning of the end for Bengal.

13:43 hrs: 64 off 180 balls - This has been a resilient knock from Wriddhiman Saha. He has given some chances to Saurashtra but this innings can turn the game in his team’s favour.

13:28 hrs: Anustup Majumdar has started his innings quite tentatively but the boundary will do him a world of good and with Wriddhiman Saha holding fort on one end, Bengal fans will still be dreaming.

13:15 hrs: Finally a breakthrough for Saurashtra! Sudip Chatterjee edged the ball onto his pads and it was an easy catch for the fielder. An important wicket for Dharmendrasinh Jadeja.

13:07 hrs: The 100 run partnership comes up for Sudip Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha with Bengal making a match out of it. When they lost two wickets quickly, a lot of people were inclined to write them off but a good show from Manoj Tiwary and this duo has brought them back into the encounter.

12:51 hrs: Bengal and Saurashtra are out for the second session and this can be a make or break period for them. Sudip Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha have steadied the innings somewhat and a gritty show from them at this point will boost their cause a lot.

12:03 hrs: Lunch Day 4! Bengal 218/3, trail Saurashtra by 207 runs.

11:53 hrs: Saurashtra have wasted three reviews on Wriddhiman Saha! The first two were very close LBW shouts which perhaps would have gone there way had their been ball-tracking but this time their appeal was for an outside edge and the third umpire did not find any conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field call of not out.

11:45 hrs: FOUR! Fifty for Wriddhiman Saha. Not the way he would have liked to but he will have no complains. Once again he wasn’t in control. The ball bounced from good length, took the outside edge of his bat and went through the hands of the fourth slip fielder. He went to his right when the ball was on his left.

11:30 hrs: FOUR! 200 up for Bengal! Wriddhman Saha continues to live dangerously. This time he just skips down and flicks it uppishly, the short-leg which is slightly deeper than usual flings his left hand but doesn’t get the catch.

11:18 hrs: OUT? NOT OUT? DRAMA and what not. Jaydev Unadkat was convinced he had Wriddhiman Saha plumb in front, so much so that he did not even feel the need to look back at the umpire while appealing. But umpire Padmanabhan was unmoved. A stunned Unadkat immediately asked for the review and surprise surprise, what was looking like absolute dead with the naked eye was actually slightly outside the line on impact. The third umpire says, half of the ball is missing, so stay with your on-field decision of not out’ and Saha survives.

11:10 hrs: FOUR! A bit uppish but in the gap. Wriddhiman Saha won’t be too happy with that shot. He played away from the body and had no intentions of keeping it down. Fortunately the ball went through the vacant gully area for a boundary.

10:52 hrs: Chance! Almost a wicket for Saurashtra but it was a difficult one. Saha flicked it with power, the forward short leg did well to get his body on the line, the ball lobbed up in the air after hitting his pads but landed safely, thankfully for Saha.

10:25 hrs: SIX! Wriddhiman Saha shows his class. A flighted delivery from Jadeja, Wriddhiman dances down the track and lofts it straight over the back of the bowler’s head. It comfortably clears the ropes. Some much needed intent from the Bengal wicket-keeper.

09:54 hrs: Fifty for Sudip Chatterjee and he reached the milestone in 154 balls. It looks like the Bengal batsman has taken a leaf out of Cheteshwar Pujara’s book and this has been one gritty knock!

09:42 hrs: Cautious start by both Wriddhiman Saha and Sudip Chatterjee as they are looking to play out the pace threat early on. A close LBW call but Saha survives for now.

09:25 hrs: Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the Ranji Trophy final between Bengal and Saurashtra. Wriddhiman Saha and Sudip Chatterjee will resume proceedings for Bengal who are batting on 134/3 but Saurashtra are still in the driver’s seat after posting 425 in the first innings.","Saurashtra vs Bengal score, Ranji Trophy final, Day 4 Highlights: Majumdar, Nandi take Bengal to 354/6 at stumps, trail Saurashtra by 71 runs",7715,2.82566429
3243,0,"Finally the suspense is over. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil will release on 28th after a deal was brokered in a high profile meet attended by Karan Johar and Raj Thackeray. Not satisfied with assurances that no actor from neighboring country will be hired in future considering the mood of the nation, the pre-condition set by MNS was that the producers will have to pay a ‘penance’ cost to the Army welfare fund for casting Pakistan actors. The producers agreed to this after doing their Math. The amount of free publicity that they had garnered due to the ongoing tussle meant they had saved enough to donate. Wonder if the army men are happy with this forced goodwill gesture from both sides!

Buoyed by their victory of sorts, MNS has gone ahead and released a series of pre-conditions to people who want to live and conduct business in Maharashtra in future.

1) Every film maker making a film with only Indian actors would get a ‘reward’ compensation irrespective of the fate of the film at box office collected from film makers who have ever made a film with any Pakistani in their lives.

2) Every business man who exports goods and services to Pakistan will have to either shut down business immediately even if it means loss of livelihood or pay ‘patriotism’ cost to stay safe in the state.

3) Anyone from other states entering Maharashtra would first have to pay a ‘penance’ cost for being born outside Maharashtra if they wished to earn their living there.

4) Everyone who has had any Pakistani link ever in the past but doesn’t have it any more will have to pay a onetime ‘repentance’ cost to ensure his well being in the country. Going further, MNS has launched a lucrative scheme which says that all people who have still not revealed their Pakistani association (via chat, FB, old friendship, etc) are allowed a 10 day ‘Voluntary Disclosure of Association Scheme’. They too can pay the repentance cost and secure their future against random attacks by MNS.

5) All people living in the cities and town falling in Maharashtra where MNS representative is not elected in the next elections will have to pay a ‘my mistake’ cost each time some important work of general public good is undertaken in the constituency. This will safeguard them against vandalism and protect against the loss of public property in their area.

*The amount for each violation will depend on the stakes involved.

Hearing this, the D-company has threatened filing a case in International Court of Underworld Justice against MNS.

“I was always under the impression that horses did not breed well in India because of the humid tropical conditions but these reports were an eye-opener. One of the reports said some of the horses are going for over 20 crores. That is way over what I earn after selling top quality stallions!! So I decided that I had to procure one of these ‘MLA’ breeds. They must be reared with utmost care and procedure, I suppose,” Mustafa added.

Mustafa’s search for the elusive MLA breed began on a rough note after the Arab horse breeder landed up at the AAP headquarters in Kaushambi. “These AAP chaps seemed to be the foremost experts on horse trading since most quotes in the reports were attributed to them,” Mustafa Pasha recalled. “However, when I asked one of them where I can purchase horses, he turned hysterical with rage, calling me an Ambani agent, my pleas that I am an agent of Pasha, Kemal & sons and not Ambani, notwithstanding. Finally, a bearded chap explained to me very patiently in a soft voice that such horse trading takes place only in the Delhi BJP headquarters. I was grateful for his pointing me in the right direction but I wish he could have been a little less sanctimonious.”

Pasha fared no better at the BJP headquarters either. “It seemed to be more of a ladoo trading center,” Pasha said of the place. “And when I mentioned horse-trading, the workers there also became hysterical, calling me an AAPtard. One guy, Jolly his name is, I believe, even came after me with a paint brush and I had to beat a hasty retreat.”

LUCKNOW: Making the fifth change in the leadership of her party in Lok Sabha in less than a year, BSP chief Mayawati has now appointed first time MP Ritesh Pandey (38), a foreign educated Brahmin from Ambedkarnagar, to head the party in the lower house.Pandey has replaced Danish Ali, who joined BSP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and was being perceived as the party’s Muslim face.While announcing Pandey’s appointment, Mayawati said that since a Muslim was already heading BSP’s state unit, she needed to give representation to other communities. Incidentally, with Pandey’s appointment, two Brahmins are now heading the party in Parliament — Ritesh Pandey in Lok Sabha and SC Mishra in Rajya Sabha Ali’s removal, his second since August, comes in an apparent bid to ensure “equal representation” of all communities within BSP, though sources in the party said Mayawati was unhappy with his frequent challenging of her hold over the party. “To bring about social equality in BSP, we have had to make some changes in the party since the Lok Sabha leader and UP state president are both from the same community. Ritesh Pandey is now the leader of the party in Lok Sabha while Malook Nagar is the deputy leader. BSP state president Munqad Ali will remain in his position,” Mayawati said. Ali, who was earlier the Janata Dal (Secular) general secretary in Karnataka , has experienced a rocky ride in BSP. Appointed leader of the party in Lok Sabha in June, he was first removed in August 2019 when he reportedly disagreed with the party’s support to the Centre on revocation of Article 370","Maya names first-time MP, a Brahmin, as BSP’s LS chief",1735,1.729106628

Misbah, in stark contrast to his stoic, phlegmatic demeanor, shed copious tears after Virat poignantly reminded him of his ammi with his blistering knock. “Virat ka shukriya aada karna hai, yaar. Take me to the Indian dressing room please,” the Pakistan skipper was heard saying. “I must also thank Dinda ji and Indian bowlers for letting us score 329 and setting it up nicely for Virat so that we could all celebrate Mothers Day,” he added before crooning soulfully “Kohli ke peeche kya hai, kohli ke peeche?” Afridi was about to answer the question but was stopped in the nick of time by Ajmal.

Kohli had of course celebrated Mothers Day in his inimitable fashion after reaching three figures, by pumping his feast in the air and uttering some words of wisdom.

Indian skipper, Dhoni, was also all praise for the Delhi lad for showing maturity in giving him the opportunity for finish the match with a boundary. “Well, of course, it was very sweet of him to have set it up nicely for Raina and me to finish it in style unlike in Hobart where he finished it himself. He’s mentally maturing with every match,” said Dhoni. When queried if he was a trifle disappointed that he couldn’t take it to the last ball for a more exciting finish, Dhoni smiled and said “Yaar, that kind of pressure would have been too much for even me to handle given this was a Indo-Pak match, not another of those boring matches against Sri Lanka.”

Now, the focus shifts to whether Sri Lanka manages to beat Bangladesh so that India can get into the finals. Sri Lanka had earlier played spoilsport in the CBS series by defeating Australia in the last league match and edging out India from the championship. BCCI has sternly warned the Sri Lankan cricket board that they will definitely buy them out and replace Sri Lanka with Burma if the Sri Lankan team shadily loses to Bangladesh.","Misbah ul Haq: “On Mothers Day, Virat ne mummy ki yaad dila di”",1978,1.668351871
3250,0,"Watching India bat in recent ODI/ T20 matches has become a non-stop advertisement for tyre companies. Rohit Sharma comes out with his big shots and scores centuries almost every second match. If and when one of the openers fall, out walks Virat Kohli who keeps batting and batting and batting. In all matches one or both of them have batted more than 80% of the time.

Rohit Sharma wields a bat with a CEAT tyres sticker, while Kohli wields an MRF. Shikhar Dhawan has come to the party in the recent matches with another MRF bat. So it looks like wielding a bat with a tyre company sticker is the best bet for a smashing performance.

What has aided this are also the absolutely flat tracks. There is none of the old fashioned swing in the beginning and reverse swing in the end. The ball does not grip for spinners. From beginning to end, the pitch is flat and aids batting. More and more 350 plus scores are being delivered and in Mumbai, South Africa crossed 400.

National Highways Authority is looking at this with interest. The concerned minister Nitin Gadkari said, “We have been increasing public spending on highways. However, the message has not reached everyone. Road building is far less glamorous than shouting intolerance. So, what we want to do is to build the NHAI brand. Critics keep saying that the pitches have become roads in ODIs. So we thought that is an idea for sponsorship. Henceforth, NHAI will sign up as pitch sponsors for all ODIs and T20 matches.“

However, this sponsorship will not apply for the upcoming T20 World Cup, as it is felt that a slow, spinning track will help India go far in the tournament. Test matches are out of bounds for now. But, the Bangalore Metropolitan Authority (BBMP) is expected to bid for Test match pitch sponsorship as the crumbling tracks in India resemble Bangalore roads the most.","After tyre company bats, NHAI to sponsor pitches for limited overs matches",1844,2.169197397

NEW DELHI: The occasional appearance of the peacock still adorns its sprawling lawns, the security in and around the building continues to be on its toes, but the occupant of one of Lutyen Delhi's most significant address has changed. The tall banyan trees at the 6 A, Krishna Menon Marg has seen history being made from the Atal era right through when he was bed-ridden due to his illness and finally witnessing Amit Shah making it his ""home"". Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in more ways than one an unique personality -- a bachelor Prime Minister, a champion of women's rights, a poet and an unapologetic follower of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which made him go to jail as well.Vinod Mehta, a former journalist who was very close to Vajpayee had recounted in his memoir 'Lucknow Boy', ""My relations with Vajpayee were good. Very good...He was leader of the Opposition and I often found myself sitting next to him at banquets. He didn't say much, but listened with interest. Like Ronald Reagan he loved jokes. He was not overly humble, but neither was he pompous. He knew his own worth and therefore did not need to prove anything.""When his government fell in 13 days, many in the opposition ranks would mock him as ""Prime Minister of 13 days"". His next tenure lasted for 13 months. While, Vajpayee never went on record to answer opposition's dig at him, he was well aware of the scoff he was subjected to. But one fine day, he told media while answering on the instability of the Government, after the 13 months ""Raj"" came to an end, that his next Government will be of 13 years and he will come to be known as the Prime Minister of 13 years. It clearly showed the man occupying the highest office of the country could take jokes cracked on him, so easily.Vajpayee's poetry and him using it in his public life was unparalleled. In many of his election rallies to Parliament speeches, he would recite poems he had written. Legends have it that when the BJP got just two seats in 1984 election, a heartbroken L.K. Advani took Vajpayee for a movie at Delhi's Golcha cinema. Years later, at a book release, Advani himself said after coming back that night Vajpayee had penned, ""Aao fir se diya jalaye"". The poem would go on to become one of the best remembered ones written by him.Ironically, when Advani was narrating the tale, Vajpayee was reduced to a vegetative state, lying in his 6 A Krishna Menon Marg residence, that hardly saw any visitors.Vajpayee in his pinnacle of power, when he was the Prime Minister in 1996, had joined a Rediff chat, a very new phenomenon in India at that time. With internet still in its early stages and no medium like Twitter available where politicians could directly talk to people, he chose to try that out. His aides Shakti Sinha and Kanchan Gupta reportedly helped him when he decided to engage in the chat.Vajpayee was a man who could take people along and rise above the narrow concept of partisan politics. Often referred to as ""Ajatshatru of Indian politics"", former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had fondly remembered Vajpayee to be too eager to help her in bringing Delhi Metro. This was quite unlike today's political scenario where the ruling Aam Aadmi Party accuses the Governor of working at behest of the BJP-led Union Government.When he died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the almost entire cabinet, walked during Vajpayee's final journey. The overpowering emotions visible in all political attendees, particularly from the non-BJP parties, was an evidence of the place he held in India's polity. Yet, his final years have been of a rather sorry state when he could barely recognise anyone.Even as Shah walked into the sprawling Krishna Menon Marg residence this year, making it the power centre of Delhi, Vajpayee's memories will forever be etched across every corner of that estate.",6A Krishna Menon Marg has come a long way,3997,2.626970228

After winning four of their first five matches, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) lost six matches in a row in IPL 2019 to dramatically drift away from the IPL playoff race. They finished at No.5 with six wins in 8 matches. KKR have won the title in 2012 and 2014 but for the past three seasons, they have not managed to reach the final.

KKR shelved out a whopping 15.5 crores – the most for an overseas player in the history of IPL - to get Australian all-rounder Pat Cummins. They also got in England’s captain Eoin Morgan and rising young wicket-keeper batsman Tom Banton in their squad to strengthen their top-order.

The Kolkata-based franchise took some tough decisions by letting go of old warhorses like Robin Uthappa, Chris Lynn, and Piyush Chawla. But KKR also showed immense faith in young pacers Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti who did not play a single game in the last edition because of injury.

The likes of Shubman Gill will be one of their key weapons along with captain Dinesh Karthik, who will lead the team for the third season in a row.

KKR also have a new support staff with Brendon McCullum returning to the franchise but this time as the head coach.

KKR Squad: Shubman Gill, Siddesh Lad, Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Rinku Singh, Nitish Rana, Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav, Harry Gurney, Lockie Ferguson, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi, Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrier, Pat Cummins, Eoin Morgan, Varun Chakravarthy, Tom Banton, Rahul Tripathi, Pravin Tambe, M Siddharth, Chris Green, Nikhil Naik

Three Indian players to watch out for

Dinesh Karthik

Karthik may have lost his place in the Indian side after a disappointing ODI World Cup but the wicket-keeper batsman continues to be a force to reckon with in T20s. He, however, had a quiet IPL last season compared to his standards. Karthik scored just 253 runs in 14 matches with only 2 fifty-plus scores to his name. The experienced campaigner would be hoping to set that right and steer KKR all the way to the title in IPL 2020.

Shubman Gill

Gill was named the Emerging Player of the Tournament for his Impressive show in IPL 2019. He scored 296 runs in 14 matches but for the better part of the tournament, he batted below No.6. When the right-hander was promoted up the order, he brought immediate success. Gill has come a long way since then. Based on his superb performance for India A, Gill also earned his maiden Test call-up last year. The Punjab batsman will be eager to demonstrate his talents in IPL 2020.

Kuldeep Yadav

The Chinaman spinner is one of the best when it comes to bowling in the shortest format of the game. But he was dropped from the KKR playing XI after a disastrous first-half of the tournament. The left-arm wrist-spinner will also have an eye to that spot in the Indian side for the T20 World Cup later this year and would look to leave a mark in this season of IPL

Three foreigners to watch out for

Andre Russell

The Jamaican is about raw power with a cricket bat and is also a handy option with the ball. Last season, he contributed 510 runs at a phenomenal strike rate of 204.81 and chipped in with 11 wickets. He was practically a one-man army for KKR, hitting 52 sixes in the tournament. KKR will hope for another all-round performance from Russell.

Sunil Narine

Narine remains a consistent wicket-taking threat for KKR. There was a lot of buzz around KKR’s decision to retain him after he picked up only 10 wickets in 12 matches and scored 143 runs with the bat, but franchise showed its faith on a trusted warrior and now it will be up to Narine to repay the faith.

Pat Cummins

The No.1-ranked Test bowler, Australia’s Pat Cummins will hog the limelight when he turns up for KKR in IPL 2020. He was picked up for 15.5 crores in the auctions and the pressure will be on him to deliver.

PHAGWARA: Even as he claimed that the Congress would win the bypolls at all four assembly seats, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday insisted that results could not be considered a referendum on the performance of his government.“We are winning the all the four seats. Jalalabad is being projected as Sukhbir Singh Badal ’s stronghold but we are set to win that seat too,” said Amarinder during his roadshow in Phagwara in support of party candidate Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal.However, when asked if the results of these bypolls should be considered referendum on the performance his government as his party was making it a main issue during campaigning and opposition was raising questions on this, he said, “These can’t be termed referendum as we have our manifesto and still there are two-and-a-half years remaining to implement it fully. It will be after the completion of the five year term that there will be referendum on the performance as work is still on.” CM was interacting with mediapersons aboard his special bus.‘Convicted cops being released on health grounds’Responding to queries about decision to grant pardon to release five police officials convicted in fake encounters when they had served very shorty terms in jails, CM said that they were being released on health ground only. Asked if they would apply these parameters to all types of convicts, he said “We are applying to everyone”. Responding to another query about pardon to cops while earlier he had been taken a clear stand against fake encounters (when he was in opposition), he brought in the issue of Sikh prisoners lodged in jails for close to 25 years who were now being released and said matter had to come to an end. “For sorting issues, people have to sit at the table at the end. They (cops) are being released on health grounds,” he added.

20 sixes and six fours in an innings. No that is not the entire team’s stat but Hardik Pandya’s boundary count at the end of the first innings of DY Patil T20 Cup semi-final on Friday. The India all-rounder continued his destructive form on return from injury by slamming an unbeaten 158 off just 55 balls for Reliance 1 against BPCL the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on Friday.

Hardik Pandya, who is playing his first competitive tournament in five months, hit as many as 20 sixes in a blistering innings coming to bat at No.4 for Reliance 1. Hardik also hit six fours in his knock providing entertained the crowd who had turned up to see the likes of him, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shreyas Iyer among others.

Hardik’s superlative innings, which came days after he had smashed 105 off 39 balls in the same tournament, propelled his side to 238 for 4, batting first.

Hardik underwent a surgery after suffering a lower-back injury five months ago and has since been on a road to recovery. He could not be fit in time for the New Zealand tour but started bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after returning from a check-up in UK.

After smashing 105 against CAG in a Group C encounter few days ago, he had said: “It’s fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone,” Hardik said on DY Patil Sports Academy Facebook page.

On his big-hitting prowess, the 26-year old added: “If it’s there in my arc I just back myself and go for it. Most of the times, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”

“When Modiji flagged off the run, Satishji was with him and all of us began to run. I had planned to complete my run as soon as possible and then wait to see how long Satishji and other BJP leaders took,” said celebrity marathon runner Milind Raman. “But to my utter shock, as I was approaching the finish line, cameramen were waiting and a couple of meters before the line, Satishji was posing like Usain Bolt. When the cameraman said ‘ACTION!’ Satishji ran a couple of steps ahead, flashed the V-sign, panted heavily, and even asked for water!”

The Congress Party once again, pounced on the opportunity to lash out at the BJP. “This is disgraceful! A real mockery of all those who genuinely ran for unity, but I’m not surprised at all. One can see from the likes of Nitin Gadkari that the BJP is a party that has never believed in real running,” said Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha. Aam Aadmi Party founder Arvind Kejriwal said, “Last year, Modiji ensured that no photo-op like this happened in Gujarat and that every one ran.

3261,0,"Distraught Indian cricket fans can look forward to brighter days for their team, both literally and figuratively. Pushed to a corner by the national squad’s defeat to old foe Pakistan in the first ODI, BCCI President N. Srinivasan has announced that the Chennai Super Kings would take on Pakistan in the two remaining ODIs. “It was the only option, paa,” explained Srini, “we are usually very smug about the team performing badly, whether it is a 4-0 whitewash abroad or a 2-1 defeat at home, but even we feel discomfited about the repercussions of India losing to Pakistan. So we’ve decided to make it a CSK-Pakistan series instead.”

Srinivasan said he spoke to the BCCI President (his alter ego) and convinced him of the merits of fielding CSK in place of Team India. “Both the BCCI President and I, in my capacity as CSK’s owner, agreed that such a course of action would be in the best interests of Indian cricket, paa,” he informed, in what is yet another testament to his legendary skill in papering over conflicts of interest.

The batting firepower of Ravichandran Ashwin, MS dhoni, S Raina, Bravo, and Hussey is expected to demolish the Pakistani bowling attack, while the CSK tradition of using foreign pacers like Hilfenhaus, Morkel and Bollinger is sure to rip apart the fragile Pakistani batting line-up. So called Cricket expert Harsha Boghle has stressed that adjusting to the ODI format will not be a problem for the CSK as having played real cricket in the IPL is sufficient practice for handling the less testing ODI format.

Team unity is also at an all time high, considering Dhoni enjoys a better rapport with members of his IPL franchise, irrespective of their nationality, than with some players from the national squad, especially those hailing from the national capital. Politicos have hailed the move, describing it as a win-win proposition. ”If Pakistan loses, the whole of India will rejoice. If CSK loses, the neighboring states of Tamil-Nadu will have something to cheer about,” observed a political expert.

However the decision had not gone down well with some of the cricketers. Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag have claimed that it was only natural that CSK lads performed on the funny Chennai pitch. Gambhir had insisted on leading KKR against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens. The matter was resolved Shah Rukh Khan who said it’s more prudent to induct Pakistani players into KKR and focus on defending next year’s IPL rather than getting entangled in the petty Indo-Pak rivalry.

The news of playing CSK rather than Team India has led to morale plummeting in the Pakistani camp. “Yaar, we aren’t even sure whether Chennai is part of India. Now where is the joy in beating them? Even playing against Sri Lanka would be less boring,” whined Pakistan skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq, who failed to cheer up even after being told that the CSK squad includes Ravindra Jadeja.

The ball has been turning square from day 1 and even Morne Morkel has had to rely on off-cutters, a la Venkatesh Prasad, rather than pace as he bowled with a different grip on day 2.

Unable to take it anymore, South African skipper Amla has requested Arvind Kejriwal to make a sporting pitch at Kotla, one that has a green tinge and doesn’t take too much turn. Arvind Kejriwal, who as we all know is a firm believer in tolerance and sportsmanship, has readily agreed to Amla’s request.

Responding to Amla’s SOS, Arvind Kejriwal said, ”Proud of you and the boys, Hashim. We welcome you to Feroz Shah Kotla. I promise you that we will be great hosts unlike BJP governments which have produced highly intolerant pitches. The AAP government, which is really your and every other underdog’s government, will turn Kotla into Cape Town by adding fresh green grass to the pitch. This pitch, in keeping with the principles of diversity and pluralism, will offer something to everyone: bounce and carry on day 1 so that the likes of Morne ji and Dale ji don’t feel like second class citizens, good batting strips on days 2 and 3, and perhaps some turn on the last two days. We have even availed ourselves the services of expert pitch maker, Mr. Sudhir Naik, who had made that wonderfully tolerant wicket in Wankhede where you guys had scored a mammoth 400+ runs.”

Kejriwal went on to lambast the Modi government for intolerance in pitch preparation. “It seems pitch preparation instructions came directly from RSS headquarters in addition to Ravi Shastri for the Nagpur pitch. Sab mile hue hain, ji. This intolerance by Modi government and RSS in Nagpur should be dealt with seriously. We at Delhi will provide a prime example of tolerance.

“WTF?” Dr. Manmohan Singh exclaimed after the latest box office figures were released and immediately tendered his resignation. “If such a lousy movie can become Bollywood’s biggest grosser, than it looks like we have indeed grossly mismanaged the economy,” Dr. Singh reportedly noted in his resignation letter. However, Rahul Gandhi managed to pacify Dr. Singh by pointing out that “mismanagement is a state of mind” and asked him to continue as the care-taker Prime Minister for a few more months. Union Minister Chidambaram tried to put up a brave front by saying that “there is no need to be alarmed over the movie’s success” before breaking down in tears and candidly admitting he has no clue anymore about what makes the economy tick.

The SRK starrer’s thumping success has already claimed another high profile casualty from the world of business: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer put in his papers a few days ago on the grounds that he is “no longer in sync with market trends and consumer tastes and it’s time to make way for a younger person”.

Even incoming RBI governor and economics star, Dr. Raghuram Rajan, was left dumbfounded over Chennai Express’ spectacular showing. “The movie’s resounding success once again shows how little we understand the functioning of the economy and highlights the flaws of assuming that human beings are by and large rational in our models. Or perhaps when people are reeling under a litany of bad news, such movies provide an outlet for frustration..whatever,” he shrugged, when pressed for an explanation.

Big B preferred to look at it philosophically and blogged: “Happy for SRK. Yesterday Abhishek wondered why Drona, which was in the same league, did not do as well. I said ‘no idea’ to which he reflexively said ‘get idea’. Ah well, the vagaries of fortune.”

Some leaders however have hailed the movie’s success as a good omen. “If SRK acting as Rahul coupled with aggressive publicity can induce people to watch Chennai Express, then Rahul acting as Rahul backed by aggressive promotion via Bharat Nirman ads can make people vote the UPA back to power,” noted Diggy.

Sources say the trigger for change of symbol was Congress spokesperson, Smt. Sonia Gandhi herself, who had told Congress leaders that “they should leave no stone un-turned in the run up to the 2014 general elections” upon which Diggy hit upon this gem of an idea.

However, some sources reveal that this decision was taken after a lot of consultation with astrologers. World renowned BABA (again self proclaimed) Swami Mithyanand disclosed, “Shri Shri Shri (108) Sonia ji, came here to me to bless Rahul baba and bring him good luck. I suggested some gemstones for Rahulji’s fingers. But it seems they have gone too far with the advice.”

Old timers said sporting birthstones would be their way of paying tribute to Jawahar Lal Nehru and bolstering his legacy. “With only one scheme named after Panditji, JNNURM, very few of the current lot even know who he is,” exclaimed 105 year Congress leader from AP, Janakiram Velapuri. Kapil Sibal said it would be tacit homage to his dad, the late Hira Lal Sibal.

However, this move has ruffled feathers in the saffron camp. “The decision by the Congress is unethical and un-lawful. Hindutva and all its related streams like Yoga and astrology are copyrighted ’election USP’ of the BJP and RSS. We would be challenging their symbol in the Supreme Court as it is a breach of patent law. The Election Commission should ban this symbol as soon as possible,” said a miffed BJP President, Rajnath Singh. IIPM chairman, Arindham Chaudhuri, has also objected to the Congress co-opting the diamond, birthstone for April, saying only IIPM alumni are diamonds, while LK Advani thundered that Congress has no right to use Ruby (Lal in Persian), which is synonymous with his legacy.

Arvind Kejriwal who was spotted yesterday with his scam sniffing dogs sensed a new scam even in this move. He said, “The rings have been used here to purposely promote the jewelry industry which is going through a rough patch. I have proof of senior Congress leaders accepting bribes from some Indian and Italian jewelry business houses.” But when our reporters asked some senior Italian ministers, they simply said that such strong promotion would help the industry and that there is no harm in paying bribe for such a work as it only facilitates things.

It would be really interesting to see if these rings would change the fortunes of the Congress (if not the Indian polity) in the 2014 elections.",Congress symbol ‘Palm’ to be adorned with astrological gemstone rings to revive fortunes,3375,2.044444444
3267,0,"The Central government under the able leadership of Shri Narendra Modi has finally allotted holidays for ‘Political vendetta’ to the already overloaded holiday calendar of India. It should be remembered that this is an event that is observed only by the privileged political class.

“India is a vast land with a diverse population. We believe in Sarva Dharma Samabhava – we respect all. Some people wanted to celebrate rising intolerance in October and we allowed them to go the whole hog. Then there has been some clamour about Political Vendetta. Himachal Pradesh CM Virbhadra Singh started small, and then the Gandhis followed it up after receiving the court summons for the National Herald case. Now Arvind Kejriwal has called for the same after the CBI raid on his principal secretary Rajender Kumar. We have to accommodate all these people in our inclusive style of governance. And so, instead of suspending MPs like we did last time, Parliament was adjourned to allow these people to pursue their ideological interests,” said Mr. Modi.

When asked what is practiced by those who swear by Political Vendetta, Parliamentary Affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu said that he wasn’t too sure.

“The little that we have gathered is that it is celebrated in the temple of democracy by assembling in the well of the House. This is followed by the chanting of ‘Tanashahi nahi chalegi, Hitlergiri nahi chalegi’. Individual believers can also chant the Modi Badnaama such as ‘Modi is a coward, Modi is a psychopath’ in the comfort of their homes and offices”, he added.

Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma, however, disagreed with the Union minister.

“As usual, the government is misleading the people. We believe that those who should be in power are not and those who are in power should not even exist. This is the same esoteric philosophy behind the statement that those who were not present when the constitution was made, now want to act as keepers of the constitution. As you know, these profound statements have been made by our beloved leader Smt. Sonia Gandhi. It is difficult for the common man to understand… all this #LetParliamentWork nonsense is because they have been given the wrong impression that we don’t work and do not allow others to work. Once they realize that Political Vendetta is the true and only path to the highest office, they will join us in our abstinence from work”, he said.

Asked about when Political Vendetta should be practiced, Mr. Sharma said that there were complicated calculations in the dates. “Choose a time before an election or when the parliament is in session. Till now, leaders have successfully used the dates of a case summons or a CBI raid to fix the time and place for claiming Political Vendetta”, he replied.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has asked opposition parties including the Congress, AAP, TMC, CPI(M) and others to intimate the Home Ministry about any other belief groups that may have been missed in the last census and thereby denied a holiday.

“We need to know by the end of this month so that the correct list of working days for the calendar year 2016 can be released by the Central government. We also need to space Parliamentary sessions so that some work gets done”, he added.",‘Political Vendetta’ believers granted holidays to practice their faith,3249,1.692828563
3268,0,"Irked by the unseemly (in his eyes) controversy over the granting of visa by Indian authorities to come to New Delhi on January 6th for the final India-Pakistan ODI, former Pakistan cricketer, Javed Miandad, has cancelled his visit since he felt like an ‘unwanted guest’.

The Pakistani batting legend will instead be making an ‘unofficial’ sojourn from Karachi to Mumbai via boat. As per the plan, he’ll be dropped off near Gateway of India in the middle of the night and then stroll over to the nearby Taj Hotel to refresh after which he will do pretty much whatever he fancies.

“Initially, I was miffed about being an unwanted guest and wanted to call off the whole thing, but the Pakistani authorities said there they had lot of experience in pushing unwanted guests into India. They suggested that I trek across the line of control into Kashmir and then hitch-hike a ride out of the Valley through the Banihal tunnel to arrive in New Delhi,” recalled Miandad, “but somehow that seemed too arduous and circuitous. That’s when my sambandhi, Dawood bhai, suggested that I hop on to the ferry service he operates from Karachi to Mumbai which would take me to Mumbai in 3 hours flat. And the best part is there are no disembarkation formalities or travel restrictions. Now how cool is that, uh? Dawood bhai rocks.”

Dawood Ibrahim confirmed as much. “Courtesy D-Company, Javed mian can look forward to a very hospitable and comfortable stay in India. I also wanted to make an Indian passport, ration card and voter-id card for him but Javed mian would have none of that because unlike me he doesn’t believe in dual citizenship.”

Miandad has a packed schedule ahead. After inaugurating a D-Company office in a seedy crime infested Mumbai locality, he will fly to Delhi to watch the 3rd ODI with Indian Cabinet Ministers followed by high tea with the Indian Prime Minister after which he will slip into Nepal and take a flight back to Lahore.

Asked whether he was nervous about making an ‘unofficial trip’, Javed laughed it off. “Haha, not really. The only person I’ve been warned to stay clear of is Arnab Goswami. I look forward to sledging the Indian PM though when I call on him.

The midday meal controversy in Uttar Pradesh where a journalist alleged that children were being given substandard meals, and its fall out, whatever the merits or demerits of the case, is one in a long list of controversies which have plagued the scheme since it was universalised in 2001. Tamil Nadu was the one state which had the foresight to have started the scheme earlier with positive results for enrolment and retention in schools.

Some years ago, I visited a midday meal kitchen run by the NGO Naandi Foundation in Hyderabad, one of many it ran at that time. The food was steamed cooked in large steel vats, eliminating the need for oil; small additions like fresh soy milk and pickles were included to the menu after the NGO found that the children liked the taste of these. Most of all, the scheme was flexible enough to allow the children to take home bits of leftover food for their younger siblings. Local women were engaged to prepare the raw material for the meals and clean the kitchens. The NGO ensured that the meals were not monotonous, and incorporated different vegetables and dals every day. On the odd occasions, a dessert would be added to the meal. The retention rate in schools which availed of the scheme was spectacular.

The midday meal is perhaps the single biggest achievement in the school system in India. Apart from increasing enrolment and retention, it has brought down hunger, and promoted health and cognitive abilities in children. There is simply nothing that anyone can find that is wrong with it, if you leave out the politics.

But as with all good schemes, several extraneous considerations come into play. In some states, ostensibly due to religious reasons, eggs were done away with, although this is a vital nutritional addition to the midday meal scheme. Several experts believe that the addition of milk and eggs in the meal is invaluable in a country where many children suffer from stunting as a result of poor nutrition in childhood. But the arguments against eggs and milk have included these food items being difficult to transport — in the case of eggs, it being easily breakable, and in the case of milk, it being prone to spoiling and contamination. It is passing strange that state governments which run the schemes are unwilling to take the responsibility of preventing such spoiling, breakage and contamination. The other foolish argument is that serving eggs would make vegetarian children uncomfortable.

The answer should be simple: they should be given an alternative, but surely no one has a right to object to a food item that some children may wish to eat. A popular NGO which serves midday meals across the country refuses to serve food which includes onions and garlic on religious grounds. It also refuses to include eggs on the menu. But, surely the primary concern must be that the meal served should be tasty and nutritious for the child and not the religious beliefs of the provider. It is here that the state governments should step in and insist that the providers should keep their beliefs aside, and do what is best for the child.

Other counterproductive tinkering with the system is the proposal to provide the child with uncooked grains and lentils to take home. This cannot guarantee that the child will actually get the food, especially the girl child whose nutritional needs are often overlooked in a patriarchal society. A former minister for women and child development argued long and hard for packaged food on the grounds that it was more hygienic and less prone to any form of contamination. Now, that may well be so, but a hot meal is what a growing child needs, and that too something to suit his or her taste. The success of Tamil Nadu has not been in just implementing the midday meal scheme across the state but in providing food that the child is familiar with.

In the case of the Hyderabad NGO I visited, some children had actually started bringing their smaller siblings to the school premises, where they would play in the grounds until the meal was served and get a small portion of the leftover food. This served two purposes: it provided some nutrition to the child who was not yet in school and created a favourable environment for enrolment at home, and it freed up the school-going child from having to stay home to help care for the smaller child.

This is one scheme which successive governments ought to be proud of. The endeavour now should be to work to make it even more attractive by incorporating food that children relate to, and ensuring that when it comes to the health and educational progress of children, politics does not become the spoiler.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after writing to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan that he would not read the paragraph mentioning the passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in his budget session address to the state assembly, governor Arif Mohammed Khan acceded to the CM’s request on Wednesday.Amid a high-voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF, Khan presented his policy address and read out the references to the anti-CAA resolution, despite his “deep reservations”.Pinarayi had written to him on Wednesday morning requesting him to maintain constitutional propriety.“I have been corresponding with the CM on the matter for the last few days. I disagree with the government view but I will read to honour his request,” the governor said in his speech, in a surprising turn of events which continued to mark the ‘dramatic’ day.The controversial paragraph said: “Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution. This august body unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Centre to abrogate CAA , 2019, which my government believes goes against cardinal principles underlying our Constitution. Pursuant to this, my government has filed an original suit before the honourable Supreme Court invoking provisions of Article 131.”Governor Khan, accompanied by the CM, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for few minutes inside the well of the House as opposition members blocked the passage. As soon as the governor entered the House, the opposition MLAs shouted “Governor go back!” and blocked the passage and prevented him from entering the dais of the speaker. Even though the speaker requested the MLAs to go back to their seats and allow Khan to deliver his address, the opposition members were unrelenting.Khan then called the watch and wards of the House and asked them to remove the protesting MLAs.Opposition member Ramesh Chennithala told reporters that the state government and the governor had come to a “truce”. “The CM’s double stand has been exposed now. The CM begged the governor to read the policy address. This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” he alleged.The Supreme Court has been hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala high court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three hydroelectric projects in 1997.In his letter to the governor on Wednesday, the CM, said sources, quoted Article 176 which describes the duty of the governor to the assembly. “I request you to read out the speech approved by the council of ministers in its entirety without addition or deletion.”",Kerala governor reads government's speech under protest,3058,1.536952256

The actor, who was last seen on the Hindi big screen in ' Mubarakan ' (2017), said that after losing his wife to cancer in 2009, he took some time off to focus on their son, Sidhant. Soon after, he met Mugdha at a friend’s wedding, and everything changed. “It wasn’t love at first sight, but we became friends. We hung out through all the ceremonies and bonded well. Then, we started meeting frequently and fell madly in love,” he says.Addressing the 14-year age-gap between them, Rahul admits having reservations about it initially. “But I realised my parents were 10 years apart. So, it isn’t that big a gap for me. Also, I believe if you’re happy, age difference and everything else shouldn’t be an issue,” he reasons, harking back to one of the most difficult phases of his life. Rahul married Rina, his childhood sweetheart, when he was 24. Their son, Sidhant, was 11 when she succumbed to cancer. He took a break from work to take care of him. “The break was totally worth it. Sidhant has grown up to be a wonderful young man.

PUNE: ""Vastad sagle dav shikavto pan ek dav kayam rakhun thevto (a wrestling coach teaches his disciples all the tricks of the game but keeps that one trick to himself)."" This was the top post on 'Fakta Sharad Pawar Saheb', the Facebook page of Pawar's followers, on Tuesday. It came soon after Pawar's nephewthe Devendra Fadnavis government.What the senior Pawar achieved by overseeing the downfall of the three-day-old government in the state is not limited to establishing that he is the undisputed boss of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and that he has the ability toof the saffron parties. His winning, chess-like moves during the fluid political situation in the state gave him the opportunity to reclaim his credibility.He has been a rebel himself; it was a rebellion by him that dented his credibility early on in his political career when he became chief minister of the state at the age of 38. Now, it is the quelling of the rebellion by his nephew which may help him regain the ""trust factor"" that has been missing from his brand of politics. For many years now, Pawar has been dubbed the ""unpredictable politician"". ""When he says yes, he means no,"" his critics say.When Ajit took oath as deputy chief minister on Saturday morning, the suspicion that he may have done so on the directives of his uncle lingered throughout the day. This despite the senior Pawar tweeting that assuming office was Ajit's personal decision.Such has been the apprehension about the NCP chief that a senior Congress leader said that he had conveyed to the party high command his niggling doubt that Pawar would double-cross them. The Congress had, therefore, taken time to come on board with the NCP and Shiv Sena.The Congress politician cannot be blamed for harbouring doubts about Pawar. In his five-decade-long political career, Pawar has switched parties in the quest for power and, when needed, even amended his stand on issues.Pawar broke away from the Congress in 1999 while questioning Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin. But he joined hands with the same party later in a post-poll alliance and even gave public speeches justifying how, according to Indian tradition, a daughter-in-law becomes part of the family, irrespective of her origins. In the run-up to the 2014 assembly polls, he vehemently campaigned against the BJP, terming it a ""communal party"". But after the election results, he offered the BJP unconditional outside support, scuttling the Sena's chances of driving a hard bargain for ministerial berths in the government. This time around, he has cast the NCP's lot with the Sena, arguing that the need of the hour is to keep a ""non-secular"" party like the BJP away from power.Pawar has sometimes offered justifications for his moves and even his critics have occasionally endorsed his change in stance and strategy, but nothing has helped erase the ""unpredictability"" stamp on him. Late veteran journalist Govind Talwalkar, who witnessed the 1978 political coup by Pawar, had written in 'Maharashtra Times' a decade ago that Pawar did not backstab Vasantdada Patil as was made out by the media, including himself.He said the rebellion was enacted by Pawar after a green signal from Y B Chavan and that he (Talwalkar) was witness to the entire backroom drama. But coming 25 years later, Talwalkar's ""revelation"" did not help improve the perception about the political coup.This time around, Pawar has remained true to his word given to the Sena and the Congress. He was at the forefront of countering 'Operation Lotus' and was able to make his nephew fall in line. This may help him regain that elusive trust but it comes when the Maratha strongman is set to celebrate his 80th birthday next month (December 12) and after over 50 years in politics. And yet, there are several who still say they can't predict what he has up his sleeve next.","Maharashtra: Master of twists and turns, Sharad Pawar shows who's the boss",4080,2.745098039

Gandhi, who watched the first episode of the show on Star Plus yesterday, reportedly flung his TV’s remote in frustration. His fury further increased after he realized that he could not switch off his set. It was left to party president Sonia Gandhi to come and press the power button on the TV to switch it off and pacify the 42-year old youth icon. According to sources in 10, Janpath, Gandhi was heard saying – “Dude! Please tell me what Aamir is doing that I have not? He is spending time with affected people and trying to understand their problems and that too from the cushy environs of an air-conditioned studio! I burst my back roaming through villages and slums and, of late, drought-hit areas! Don’t I deserve to be given credit and appreciation for the idea?!”

“This is …what is the word for it? Wait, let me ask Pritam. He hears the word all the time, and he will be able to recollect it in a jiffy,” said Gandhi, who, after a brief telephonic chat with the music director, exclaimed, “Aah yes! Plagiarism! This is blatant plagiarism! The only thing Aamir isn’t doing is sharing daal-chawal with the victims! He has at least not copied that part!”. Gandhi, in a fit of rage, then grabbed a photo of Aamir Khan and tore it to shreds.

Gandhi’s frustration has precipitated uneasiness within party circles as well, with the top brass holding an emergency meeting to discuss punitive action against the show. If rumors are to be believed, Information & Broadcasting minister Ambika Soni will soon be issuing a notice to Star TV to stop the show’s broadcast with immediate effect, unless either of the following conditions are met – a) Rahul Gandhi is paid royalty and given credit for his idea; b) the show is renamed “Shri Rajiv / Indira Gandhi ‘Satyameva Jayatey’ Karyakram”. Union HRD Minister Kapil Sibal also is said to be in talks with social networking websites to censor content including users’ comments about the controversial show.

In a related incident down south, DMK patriarch M.Karunanidhi was aghast on seeing the name “Satyameva JAYAtey” and accused Chief Minister Jayalalitha of wasting her time on TV shows instead of focusing on governance, before he was informed that the show had nothing to do with the AIADMK supremo.

However, things did not work out well for Gandhi, as there were only 2 seats available at the time of booking – one in the first row and the other in the second. When Gandhi asked Pawar if he could take the 1st row seat and Pawar the second, the latter stormed out of the ticket counter in a huff. However, he soon ran back towards Gandhi and hid behind him, when he saw serial slapper Harvinder Singh approaching him. A crafty Gandhi, however rushed to the restroom and returned in a jiffy, with a cricket bat and his boxers worn over his pyjamas. “Don’t mess with the Batman!” warned Gandhi to Harvinder, pointing his bat at him, following which Harvinder beat a hasty retreat.

In the midst of all the drama, SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav rushed to the ticket counter to buy one of the remaining tickets, but unfortunately ended up buying one for The Amazing Spiderman 3D. Meanwhile, a grateful Pawar thanked Gandhi for saving him and said, “Like Mamata Didi, I too, accept the #2 position in the cabinet, with a heavy heart!” Newspaper editors were overjoyed by the news, with many of them fighting it out to claim the rights of the news report title “The Rahul Gandhi Rises.”

A smiling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh later read out his speech to the media, saying, “It brings me utmost happiness to note that our own Dark Knight rose to the occasion and saved our very valued Pawarji.

The aftermath of a terror attack in a democracy follows a pattern. All political parties initially express shock, anguish and anger. There are announcements of firm intent and national unity — and emphasis on how this is not the time for politics. This attempt at bipartisanship at the top does not last too long.

The second-rung leaders on the ruling side speak of how their response will be different from past “weak” regimes; their counterparts in the opposition begin blaming the government for intelligence failures and demand action. And slowly, this seeps up — before you know it, the top leaders are engaged in a slanging match.

The responses after Pulwama have followed almost the same pattern. It took only a few days for expressions of unity and how this is an issue of national interest to give way to competitive political jostling. This is not desirable and we do not endorse it — but in the Indian democratic landscape, just months before elections, it is not surprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strong statements indicate that a major response is in the offing.

This could well be a leader reassuring the nation. But the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) political managers see the attack as a possible opportunity to reinforce their image of a strong party, willing to take strong action against Pakistan, and thus buttress their nationalist credentials. At a time when the political challenge has become formidable for the regime, this will help.

The opposition too can smell an opportunity. By saying they will back the government, and will have no more conversation on the issue, Congress president Rahul Gandhi sought to pre-empt the possibility of the BJP monopolising the credit for any action.

But his party’s managers believe that Pulwama has dealt a blow to the government’s claims of a track record of cracking down on terror; raised questions about the efficacy of the surgical strikes the government so hyped; and put BJP in a bind for they need to now respond but can’t allow a full-blown conflict.

This swashbuckling showman’s movies are renowned for their high production standards that ensure manifold returns, cementing his reputation as the Bollywood Badshah.

SRK has already achieved cult status and his movies’ overseas box office receipts have left him peerless in the industry. SRK had successfully dabbled in television in the early stages of his career before scaling new heights in the Hindi film industry. A recipient of numerous awards, SRK has been always humble about it.

SRK has had his share of controversies too. His religious inclinations have been a talking point among the orthodox. It is widely known that his wife is a practicing Hindu. As a celebrity, his personal life, including stories of marital discord, have provided grist for the rumour mills. Yet, despite controversies and distractions, SRK has remained grounded and focused on his work.

Thank you, SRK. Thanks a lot for your yeoman contributions to the world of showbiz. Thank you for producing films like ‘Rang De Basanti’, ‘Barfi’, ‘Peepli Live’, ‘Paan Singh Tomar’ and many more.

This is a tribute to you, dear SRK, a.k.a. Siddharth Roy Kapur.

3283,0,"Prashant Bhushan’s caustic comments comparing Dr. Manmohan Singh with the Mahabarat character, Shikhandi, drew rare words of praise from Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari. “Actually, we are on the same page as Bhushanji on this one,” said Manish, sounding uncharacteristically sweet during a routine interaction with the media.

When reporters sought a clarification, Manish barked, “Dude, what was Shikhandi’s role during the great war of the Mahabharata? To shield Arjuna from attacks, no? In a similar vein, Dr. Mamnmohan Singh absorbs criticism from the Opposition and rabid civil society activists so that an unencumbered Rahulji can focus on leading us to victory. So how can we have a problem with that? It’s a sexy analogy.”

The Congress High Command is so impressed with Bhushan’s analogy that it could be adopted as the central theme of a new set of posters in praise of Rahul Gandhi, he further informed.

When asked for his reaction, veteran BJP leader L K Advani said he would no longer take pot-shots at the Prime Minister or engage him in verbal duels on the floor of the House in light of Team Anna’s allegations. “People say I’m the Bheesmah Pitamah of my party. So I ought to live up to his standards, na?” he reasoned.

Team Anna’s attacks and the Congress’s vapid response have left Dr. Manmohan Singh deeply disappointed. “What is this, yaar? I would have been cool if they had called me Dhritrashtra. I admit I turn a blind eye to the hanky-panky going on around me while indluging in discussions of a theoretical nature with Vidhur, I mean, Monty. But why question my manhood and all? Political rhetoric and criticism should not cross certain boundaries,” fumed Dr. Manmohan Singh.

The PM proceeded to lash out at Team Anna by saying, “If I am Shikhandi, then Prashant Bhushan is Suppandi.”

“I am greatly moved by how cricket lovers all over the world have reacted to my rant against Misbah, Waqar Younis, Younis Khan and others. I never expected such a response, so I’ve decided to go mainstream now. Inspired by Modiji, I’ll be starting my own ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio address. I’ll be doing one episode for every Pakistan match on a trial basis. If it goes well, I’ll do an episode after every cricket match, even for matches like Scotland vs Afghanistan,” the Rawalpindi Express told The UnReal Times.

For the Indian audience, Shoaib’s Mann ki Baat will be carried by All India Radio. According to AIR sources, the phones in their marketing office have been ringing non-stop ever since Shoaib made the announcement. “All the ad-slots have been sold out! Can you believe that? And that too for rates thrice as those of Modiji,” said an exultant AIR official. “Shoaib Akhtar will single-handedly make AIR profitable!”

The development has sent a shudder down the spine of the Star Sports management. “This is worrying. I have seen that video, and I’ll admit that Shoaib’s post-match analysis leaves our post-match programs in the dust. Who’s going to listen to Harsha Bhogle babbling when they can listen to Shoaib going after every Pakistani player! Already, the demand for the ad slots on our post-match programs have come down by 80%,” said a Star Sports official.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Cricket Board has passed an order forbidding contracted players from listening to Shoaib’s addresses, for the devastating effect it has on player psyche. “We have even deployed Ahmed Shehzad to tell the players that if any one of them listens to Shoaib’s words even by accident, they will not go to heaven and should be ready for the fire,” coach Waqar Younis said.

Former Pakistan captain and PTI Chief Imran Khan has warned PM Nawaz Sharif that he’ll go on another container-top agitation if appropriate action isn’t taken against Shoaib. Sources say that Sharif has already approached UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon regarding the issue.

3287,0,"In keeping with a glorious tradition of unleashing “mystery spinners” at the highest level of the game at opportune moments against mentally brittle opponents, the Sri Lankan team is all set to debut an extremely mysterious off-spinner, one KYNTPC Azimuth, in the second Test against arch rivals India.

“We have kept KY [Lankans fondly refer to their teammates by the first two of many initials] wrapped in cotton wool thus far, resisting the temptation to unveil him during the series against Pakistan. We wanted to save him for the Indians and with us 1-0 ahead, it is time to go in for the kill..HAHAHAHA,” Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews sent out an ominous warning to the Indian camp.

The 20 year old KYNTPC Azimuth is purported to possess a highly unorthodox, freaky bowling action and is considered “very difficult to read” in domestic circles. He bowls the usual assortment of off-spinners, top spinners and legbreaks, with different grips and actions, but also possesses this extremely weird ball that is not quite the carrom, not quite the doosra, not quite the flipper.

“We’ll have to coin a new name for it, really. It dips in gently, breaks short of a good length, and can turn either way or go straight on to completely mesmerise the batsmen who always have that deer caught in the headlights look after he has bowled it,” revealed Sri Lankan commentator, Russel Arnolds. “I predict a great debut for him followed by an IPL contract after which he should become more readable and generally pedestrian. But before that he’d have his done his job for his team and country.”

Needless to say, the move has struck terror in the hearts of the Indians. Rohit Sharma has also developed a hairline fracture and ruled himself out of the rest of the series while Virat Kohli has requested the presence of Anushka Sharma to calm frayed nerves. Ravi Shastri tried to put up a brave front saying the boys will continue to play aggressive cricket but his tone betrayed his apprehensions about the looming threat.

3288,0,"In the wake of controversies surrounding saints beatified by the Norwegian Nobel Committee including Amartya Sen and Mother Teresa, Robert Vadra has demanded a law on the “right to be revered”. The list of protectees who cannot be verbally frisked includes VVIP Nobel dignitaries with Vadra’s name sticking out like a sore thumb as usual.

Robert Vadra asserted with all his seriousness that the dignitaries will have the right to be unquestioned and unaudited no matter the wealth of our institutions and other such noteworthy miracles. Speaking to a flashy magazine dedicated to building muscle mass, Vadra said, “Both my dynasty and Mother Teresa have the right to be revered irrespective of our considered judgment on the use of contraception or lack thereof. Sakshi Maharaj however may share our utmost disdain for his abhorrently identical views on the matter.”

The Congress party has jumped to the defense of Vadra insisting that a rights based regime is their mainstay in politics. The Congress spokesperson asserted, “We will spread the word of Amartya and other saints of the ‘rights based approach’ with missionary zeal. We insist that the gospel of Amartya be preached indefinitely from its high church at Nalanda, by its holy political appointees.” The media in the meanwhile has also insisted on its right to pass hypocritical holy judgment on the good deeds or lack thereof on all of their creations – saints and demons alike.

The AAP spokesperson agreed with the Congress spokesperson that the dole based approach was the key to planting new parties and harvesting voters. The AAP spokesperson admitted that they did not really have to preach to the converted Indian voter when it came to the rights based approach. They were temporarily led astray by the promise of markets. Therefore the Delhi elections were merely a ghar wapsi for the freebie hungry voter. “May the Indian taxpayer forever fund market inefficiencies. Their souls will be saved by socialism,” prayed the AAP spokesperson in the name of Marx and Lenin.

The AAP spokesperson argued that where they differed from the Congress was their dharna based evangelism. “Our good shepherd does not feed his flock, but keeps insisting that they fast. He will ultimately lead the Indian voter to the good pastures of plentiful doles.” Modi by contrast, who is also a habitual preacher, has been unsuccessful in preaching to the Indian voter on the merits of the market.

Mohan Bhagwat in the meanwhile has also been shockingly incompetent in the business of service and PR. His soulless ghar wapsi campaign has only harvested media hate.

3291,0,"Bihar may not have a franchise in the cash rich IPL but it may do one better by launching its own T-20 tournament called the Bihar Premier League (BPL). The initiative comes in the wake of the Bangladesh cricket board successfully hosting its own T-20 tournament, the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL again).

The Nitish Kumar Government has nearly finalized the contours of the alternate BPL which should do wonders for cricket in Bihar. “First I gave you law and order, and then good roads. Now I will give you pure, unadulterated, high octane BPL. Biharis will not have to migrate out of Bihar to catch T20 cricket action anymore,” thundered Nitish Kumar while addressing youth in Kishanganj, an impoverished district in North East Bihar.

The BPL will mirror IPL in many respects: Deputy CM, Sushil Kumar Modi (no relation of Lalit Modi), has been appointed the BPL commissioner. The inaugural edition of the glitzy tournament will feature 6 teams – the Mythili Marauders, Royal Bhojpuri Barons, Patna Paan-chewers, Bhagalpuri Jumbos, Kosi Floodgate Openers, and Dabangg Dashers.

Prominent Bihari industrial houses and personalities have expressed keen interest in investing in these franchises and being a part of the unfolding Bihar growth story. Sonakshi Sinha has convinced dad to bid for a stake in either Dabbang Dashers or Patna Paanchewers while Bhojpuri megastar, Ravi Kishan, add glamour by buying Royal Bhojpuri Barons. Bam Bam Chaudhry, the wealthy Gutka magnate from Araria, is also in the fray for franchise ownership along with Thakur Pawan Singh, a don turned construction tycoon.

Shashi Tharoor is reportedly ‘mentoring’ a motley bunch of diamond traders from Surat to take a stake in Bhagalpuri Jumbos. “Kerala’s cricketing prospects may yet get a boost if the quaintly named Bhagalpuri Jumbos, an apt replacement for the Kochi Tuskers, can be steered by me in the right direction,” wrote the suave former UN diplomat turned politician in his fortnightly column, Tharoor’s Thali.

However, Shushil Kumar Modi has refused to have any truck with Tharoor. “Don’t want to lose my job by getting entangled with that dude,” tweeted Bihar’s deputy CM.

Unlike IPL, the BPL will not have any restrictions on number of foreign players in a team but the franchises will have to strictly adhere to caste quotas. “No restrictions on nationality,even Pakistanis welcome. After all, Biharis are extremely large-hearted. But the teams will have to feature at least 2 Mahadalits, 3 OBCS, 3 MBCs and 2 minorities. Non adherence to caste quotas will result in summary expulsion,” warned Nitish Kumar, who is renowned for his social engineering skills and will be monitoring team composition very closely. Mercurial Pakistani all-rounder, Shahid Afridi, announced his retirement from international cricket to focus on BPL after hearing the news.

But does Bihar have the requisite cricketing infrastructure to host a tournament that measures up to international standards? “Matches will be held on grounds confiscated from venal IAS officers. So no problems on that front,” quipped Nitish, flashing the V sign to The Unreal Times.

The poor chap is already managing mountains of expectations, and now this media glare is adding to the pressure. He must be feeling like how Abhishek Bachchan and Rohan Gavaskar felt at the start of their careers,” said Mulayam to The UnReal Times, and added with a grin, “In my case, it was different though.

Yadav defended himself, saying that AAP’s internal committee had exonerated him from any violation of the code and hence, the matter should have ended then and there. “Actually, in all fairness, it was not a 100% clean chit, as they had not examined the footage completely,” Professor Yadav revealed, oozing sanctimony. “The committee couldn’t take my self-righteousness after more than a minute, so they just stopped the video short and issued me a clean chit.

Noted nuclear scientist and former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Anil Kakodkar on Saturday asked students to stay away from politics, though he added that issues vexing them will give rise to agitations.

He was speaking at a function in Thane in Maharashtra on the occasion of the release of a book on his life.

He was answering a query from the media on the CAA and NRC protests.

Over the past few days, several campuses across the country have seen strong students’ protests over Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens exercise.

“I feel students should not get into politics.

However, if something is agitating them, then it is not that one has to keep quiet. All agitations are started by students and there is nothing unexpected about it,” Dr Kakodkar said.

He advised students to prepare themselves for the competition they would face in the corporate world, adding that failure to do so would be akin to the defeat princely states endured in the 19th century when the East India Company began expanding its footprint in the sub-continent.

He said the education system in the country has to gear up to ensure students got the knowledge required to solve the problems facing the country, and emphasis must be on those coming from rural areas so that they can compete with their city counterparts.

“There are plenty of opportunities in the form of skilling and training, and if this is done, then sky is the limit. The education system must provide students a good atmosphere as their progress is based on it,” he told the gathering.

He also paid tribute to Homi Bhabha, widely acclaimed as the principal architect of India’s nuclear energy programme.

Kakodkar said Dr Bhabha thought up the ‘three stage nuclear power programme’, which sought the use of uranium and thorium reserves found in monazite sands of coastal regions of South India, when even five per cent of that technology had not been firmed up.",NRC-CAA protest: Nuclear scientist tells students to stay away from politics,2004,1.497005988

Although politicians routinely trade barbs, Mr. Sinha’s scathing remarks have touched a raw nerve with the PM, who has threatened to resign rather than put up with such harsh and intemperate remarks.

Talking to reporters, Dr. Singh, in a voice choked with emotion, said: “People have described me as nikamma, under-achiever, puppet, politically impotent, even corrupt. But never in my distinguished career have I been labeled a consultant, and a management consultant at that. Yashwantji has crossed the laxman rekha with this insult and I would rather quit than put up with such abuse.”

“I admit a large part of my work comprises giving abstract advice to cabinet colleagues and whispering sweet nothings in the ears of my anchor client, Soniaji, but give me some credit for occasionally standing up for what I truly believe in and wielding clout. Like threatening to resign if my party didn’t support me on the Indo-US nuclear deal. Why paint me as a smooth talking, laptop wielding, execrable consultant ? I don’t deserve to be denigrated thus,” he lamented.

The PM wistfully recalled how in 1991 his then boss PV Narasimha Rao had told him: “Spare me the mumbo-jumbo and produce results on the economic front.” “And I rolled my sleeves up and turned the economy around rather than producing colorful PowerPoint slides.”

The BJP has distanced itself from Mr. Yashwant Sinha’s acerbic statement, saying such truculent remarks were unwarranted. “Agreed, the PM is not in control of his government but to describe him as a management consultant is highly denigratory. Sinhaji could have been little more circumspect in his choice of words,” said BJP spokesperson, Prakash Javelinthrower.

Later, Mr. Sinha retracted his statement. “I only wanted to make the point that Dr. Singh, for whom I have the highest personal regard, has been completely ineffective as the Prime Minister. But calling him a management consultant was uncalled for, in retrospect. I have no hesitation in taking back my words if he feels hurt,” said the BJP leader.","BJP leader plunges political discourse to a new low, calls Manmohan Singh a management consultant",2227,2.424786709

Actress-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar quit the Congress on Tuesday afternoon barely six months after joining the party. She blamed petty in-house politics and held the party leadership responsible for not putting in reasonable efforts to put its house in order.

Matondkar, who fought the Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North constituency, said that she was feeling betrayed by the Congress leadership. “My political and social sensibilities refuse to allow vested interests in the party to use me as a mean to fight petty in-house politics instead of working on a bigger goal in Mumbai Congress,” she said

In July, Matondkar’s letter to then Mumbai Congress chief Milind Deora had surfaced where she made scathing comments against trusted aides of her senior colleague Sanjay Nirupam.

Matondkar said that the leaders whom she had held responsible for her defeat in her letter to Deora were given new responsibilities. She also pointed out that her letter, sent on May 16 and meant for Deora, was “leaked”. Milind Deora has resigned as the Mumbai Congress unit chief. He has been replaced by Eknath Gaikwad.

Matondkar has however said that she will stick to her thoughts and ideologues hinting that she might not join any other political party. She had recently visted the flood-affected Kolhapur and Sangli regions of Maharashtra.

Nirupam had hit out at Deora after Matondkar’s letter became public. “Young leader who desires to stabilise party at national level has released copies of complaint letter of an LS candidate to media houses to publish it. It was addressed to him against party workers after election. Is this the way he is going to adopt to stabilise the party,” Nirupam had tweeted.

Deora had hit back saying that a party and its ideals are bigger than one individual. “Some unpleasant and unwarranted commentary from certain quarters should be ignored and not countered. The Congress party has seen many upheavals and shall overcome this one too,” he had said in a statement.

Deora, a former Union minister, had replaced Nirupam as the Mumbai Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in April-May. Both had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from South Mumbai and Mumbai North West respectively.","Urmila Matondkar quits Cong, cites ‘in-house politics’ in Mumbai unit as reason",2280,1.666666667

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

3298,0,"Mumbai: A recent Koffee With Karan episode featuring Indian cricketers KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya has created a lot of controversy over Hardik Pandya’s remarks during the show. His comments reflecting misogyny and sexism didn’t go down well and he had to apologize on social media for his remarks. However, the apology hasn’t pacified BCCI officials who have issued a show-cause notice to him and instructed him to undergo special training.

As punishment for spending all his time obsessing over sex, as shown on the show, BCCI has asked him to regain his virginity and appointed Salman Khan as his special virginity coach. Bollywood superstar Salman Khan had shocked everyone in an episode on the same show a few years earlier where he disclosed, he is still a virgin.

Speaking to the press, a senior BCCI official said, “We were shocked to learn that instead of spending their spare time talking cricket, these single boys are talking about girls all the time and going around looking for “action”. This is unacceptable and we can’t allow this. All our young players have to be virgins and they should not waste their time looking for girls and discussing their “sexual conquests” like some cheapsters. That is why we have decided to send him to Salman bhai, someone who has had hundreds of girlfriends but is still pure and virgin. We are sure that he will be able to inculcate the same discipline in these boys.”

When asked whether BCCI has anything to say about his other remarks as well, he said,” Yeah yeah, other remarks are problematic as well but let’s focus on the main problem right now, that these boys are having sex instead of practice.”

Meanwhile, Ravi Shastri has denied any knowledge of the players misbehaving in bars and clubs. The Indian coach said,” I practically live in bars and I have never seen these boys come there at all, forget misbehaving.”",BCCI instructs Hardik Pandya to train with Salman Khan to regain his virginity,1875,1.6

Now it seems that Simi’s celebrity endorsement value may also go up exponentially. L’Oréal is likely to dump Ash for Simi as their brand ambassador. L’Oréal marketing Vice President, Mr. Cyrus Bottlewalla, said “The biggest consumer segment for our products is 60+ ladies who want to pass off as 16 year olds. Unfortunately, Ash is and looks like a very beautiful 40 year old and does not appeal to this demographic anymore. Simi, who is 60 going on 16, is therefore a more suitable brand ambassador. What’s more, she seems more plastic than Ash, so no worries on that front either.”

In the new marketing campaign, a very confident Simi will say “It’s possible to think and look 16 at 60” instead of “because you are worth it”. Simi has reacted positively to the overture from L’Oréal. “I was wondering what took them so long to sign me. Through this ad campaign, I will convince people that that L’Oreal and not Botox is the secret of my beauty” purred a happy looking Simi.

Incidentally, Sonam Kapoor, who also endorses L’Oréal and had once cattily referred to Ash as ‘auntie’, hastened to clarify that “Simiji is like a didi to me and not aunty.

Japan’s parliament on Wednesday passed a law to encourage female candidates to stand for elections in a country where women are vastly underrepresented in politics.

Under the new law, political parties are urged to make the number of male and female candidates as equal as possible and are encouraged to set targets for gender parity. But the law includes no penalties for parties that fail to do so, nor incentives to encourage them.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made increasing female participation in the workforce a key plank of his economic policies as Japan struggles with a labour shortage. But only 47 of the 465 members of parliament’s lower house are women, a ratio of 10.1 percent that puts Japan behind Myanmar and Gambia in terms of female government representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

“I hope this law will make a big change in Japanese politics,” said Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda, one of the members who drafted the legislation, according to public broadcaster NHK.

“I hope women who were hesitant to become candidates will be courageous” and run for election, she said.

The law was put forward by a cross-party group of lawmakers, but reportedly faced opposition during the drafting process despite containing no penalties for non-compliance. Next year Japan will hold regional elections in April and elections for parliament’s upper house in July.

3301,0,"With the UPA failing to forge consensus on who ought to replace Smt. Pratibha Patil as the next President of India, the Congress has proposed the candidature of its tallest leader, Shri Rahul Gandhi, to break the logjam.

Justifying the move, senior Congress leader Shri Digvijaya Singh explained, “Shri Rahul Gandhi, after years of relentless service and grass-roots work through padyatras and stopovers in rural households has gained the requisite experience to take over the reins of the Government. Across the world, charismatic and transformational leaders such as David Cameroonji, Obamaji became heads of State in their early 40s. Shri Rahulji will follow in their foot-steps.”

In India, career politicians usually serve as ministers or governors before capping their careers with a stint at Raisina Hill but the Nehru-Gandhi scion may buck the trend. “If Rajivji could become PM in less than 5 years of entering politics, then why can’t Rahulji become President of India in the same span? After all, he’s exhibited such a steep learning curve ever since he joined politics,” reasoned Shri Digvijaya Singh.

With the polity divided on whether Pranab da, a Brahmin, or a leader from a minority group, such as Shri P A Sangma (a tribal Christian), or Shri Hamid Ansari, should occupy Raisina Hill, Rahul Gandhi could emerge as the compromise candidate to bridge these differences.

“Just like light exhibits both wave like and particle like properties, Shri Rahulji is imbued with characteristics of both forward castes (Kashmiri Pandit) and minorities (Roman Catholic and Parsee). Indeed, he is the light that will deliver the nation from darkness,” raved Shri Digvijaya Singh.

“Unlike Pratibha tai, Rahulji does not have a huge extended family. So his foreign trips on behalf of India will not cost as much. Morever, Rahul ji has expressed a keen interest in undertaking padyatras in the countries he visits and stopping over in foreign Dalit households rather than staying in plush 5 star hotels,” explained the veteran Congress leader.

Rahul Gandhi is kicked about taking his career to the next level. “Yaar, I am sick and tired of rural padyatras, and pretending to solve the problems of people. The new job, I am told, will formalize my role as the figure- head of the Government with a purely ceremonial role. Moreover, it will be nice to have Rastrapati Bhavan all to myself after staying in 10, Janpath all this while,” he said, when contacted by The Unreal Times.",Rahul Gandhi emerges as front-runner to become India’s 13th President,2481,2.418379686

The Congress President personally called up The UnReal Times political correspondent, Rajnithi Sarkarwala to share her grief over recent reports of Congress spin-doctors planting articles of her purported unhappiness over some of the missteps of her government. As per these reports, Sonia has been unhappy with leakages in MNREGA, skewed priorities of the Planning Commission, even the severe humidity in New Delhi. The Congress President could have gone to other media houses but she realized that The UnReal Times has the most stellar reputation of being uneconomical with the truth.

“Now we politicians don’t trust ToI, yaa. They are ready to print anything for the right consideration,” she said in between sobs. “And those NDTV chaps have become victims of their own biases. They don’t pick up articles that don’t lend themselves to a ‘blow to Modi’ tagline,” she added.

Sonia then broke down as she attempted to reconstruct how she felt when she read reports of her minions frequently planting articles of her unhappiness. “We completely feel your pain, ma’am,” Rajnithi said by way of consolation. “No spin-doctor or loyalist could have done a better job in conveying your anguish and you did the right thing in directly getting in touch with us to plant this article,” he added in an attempt to make her feel better.

Later, Sonia’s political secretary, Ahmed Patel, got in touch with The UnReal Times to plant an article about Sonia’s unhappiness over the precipitous slide of the Indian Rupee.

“What the Maya prophecy meant is not that world would end in 2012; but rather that Maya rule in Uttar Pradesh would end in 2012. The tidal wave is a poetic reference to the Akhilesh wave which swept UP earlier this year,” he noted.

The Mayologist also interpreted some of the cryptic predictions in light of political developments in the Indo-Gangetic plains, saying, “Polar reversal from north to south ”inthe prophecy is a poetic reference to mean Maya power in North (Uttar) Pradesh will go south. The prophecy has already come true earlier this year so people have nothing to fear.”

But what about getting the date of the end of the Mayan world wrong? After all, BSP rule in Uttar Pradesh encompassing 3% of mankind came to an end on 4th March, 2012 and not December 21st.

The move follows Nitish’s recent decision of suspending a JDU MP who met Modi in person.

Speaking only to The UnReal Times secular correspondent Syed Ali Mohammad, Nitish said, “Last night, I had a dream..sorry, a nightmare..a Maha-nightmare to be precise. In it, I met Modi, hugged him and then talked at length about development, growth etc. But out of nowhere, I began to hear the morning prayers from a nearby mosque and I woke up with a loud scream. My neighbours got scared. I had to then explain to them that it was a horrible nightmare.”

A distraught Nitish uncontrollably burst into tears, saying, “Sniff! I should have listened to Lalu and not had biscuits during the solar eclipse. May be I wouldn’t have got this nightmare then.”

“As a punishment for meeting Modi in my dream, I have decided to suspend myself from the JDU with immediate effect. I will don a skull cap, go to the mosque everyday and seek forgiveness from the almighty and only when I’m done repenting and when I’m over my sin, I will return to the party. I will also pray to God to give me special dreams from now on that are inclusive and hope that communal forces are kept at bay,” Nitish added.

Around 11 PM last night, a bright lightning was spotted by neighbors of the Church along with a heavy thunder. Within few seconds, there were sounds of glass breaking and security of the Church could sense smoke billowing out of the church.

“Once the smoke started coming out, I rushed to the altar and found that the lightning had cracked the glass windows and burnt a few wooden benches. I doused the fire immediately and then called the police,” a security guard at the Church told this reporter.

CCTV capture of lightning entering the church to attack it. Police is unable to nab the lightning even with such clear proofs. This proves that minorities are not safe in India.

However, some groups believe that the police shouldn’t rule out a foul play. Speaking to Faking News, Robert Salvo, an ex-IAS officer, said, “We asked for rains so that farmers benefit, but Modi’s India is sending lightning down our churches and thunders down our hearts. I feel like I’m on a hitlist.”

One expert has cleared doubts that had been clouding over the clouds and have squarely blamed Modi and RSS as responsible for the attacks.

“This is nothing but a very long conspiracy by the Hindutva groups. Cloud seeding technique is not new, and these groups are known to be tech savvy. It will be shame if police doesn’t investigate this angle,” Darana Ayub, an investigative journalist said.

Mr. Ayub also wrote an article on how minorities were being targeted by accidents, fire, storm, and earthquakes in Modi’s India.

“You can’t blame external factors like clouds and rains. It is a homegrown monster. We should open our eyes and see the threat. Modi had quoted ‘where the head is held high’ to Christians last month and now, can we hold our head high and face the sky during rain or lightning? Modi must answer this,” the article said.

Activists have also expressed unhappiness over the direction in which investigation was moving.

They are expected to campaign from land as opposed to the Congress philosophy of “helicopter-campaigning.”

While Narendra Modi remains unfazed and has decided to counter this new wave of assault by addressing rallies using more holographic images, the BJP top brass has cried foul and has been threatening to report the Gujarat Congress to the Election Commission for “coercive tactics.” However, sources say that the Chief Election Commissioner is already under the Imperius curse and will not interfere.

3312,0,"With repackaging hits from the past being the new in-thing, hotshot director Sajid Khan, undoubtedly buoyed by the successful failure of Himmatwala, has announced the mother of all remakes: that of one of India’s greatest cult classics, Mughal-e-Azam.

Throwing light on his decision, Sajid said, “After Himmatwala, I was looking for the next movie to pay tribute to. With not many movies left from the 80s to recycle, I decided to dig deeper into the past. Considering I have seen Mughal-e-Azam 236 times, it seemed a suitable candidate. Sajid Nadiadwala has generously agreed to finance the movie and Sajid Wajid will provide the music. In fact the music director duo is already scouting the streets of Jaipur and Lucknow for old rehashed tunes. As a back-up, I’ve also sounded out Pritam to be on standby to creatively plagiarize Naushad saab’s haunting tunes.”

Answering questions about the cast, the chubby director replied, “Satish Shah will play Emperor Akbar. He has been asked to go on a weight-gain program to gain about 20 kgs. Madhuri Dixit will play Jodhabai and the all-important role of Salim will be played by Salman Khan. He will be given vigorous training in Urdu diction. Anarkali will be essayed by Sneha Ullal. After the disaster called Lucky, she is sad enough to bring out the tragic life of the lover.” When asked by The Unreal Times about how the battle scenes would be shot and the elaborate sets handled, the director said that CGI and the use of Plaster of Paris would be the hallmark of his movie’s special effects.

Sajid’s plans have predictably triggered panic of seismic proportions across the world. Dilip Kumar, the lead in the original, was hospitalized as soon as he heard the news. Ram Gopal Verma jumped out of his 5th floor office in Bandra, screaming “Even I won’t be able to take it” while there were uncorroborated reports of Mughal Emperor Jahangir crawling out of his grave in Lahore in the middle of the night and running helter-skelter.

A delegation comprising actors, historians, Hindi film buffs, Madhubala fanboys, Kim Jong-un, Dilip Kumar’s relatives, Taliban leader Mullah Omar, and Madhura Honey are now camping outside Sajid’s residence to dissuade him making the movie even as the world awaits the outcome of ongoing talks with bated breath. After 24 hours of intense negotiations, a faint glimmer of hope has emerged. “With Aditya Chopra’s chick-flick, Aurangzeb, about to release, Sajid just might postpone his magnum opus by a few months. This gives us some breathing space and extra time to talk him out of it,” informed a sleep deprived Mullah Omar to anxious reporters, before heading back to resume talks.

KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar spent two hours at chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s Kalighat residence on Sunday evening during Kali Puja ceremonies. “Anyone who comes to a Puja comes with a pure heart and leaves it with a purer heart,” he said while leaving.Dhankhar said he had a “great time” at the CM’s residence, adding, “Our gestures fully matched”.The governor’s presence at the CM’s home drew senior state functionaries — state education and parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee, speaker Biman Banerjee , chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha, DGP Virendra, and special security advisor (SSA) Surajit Kar Purkayastha — to her Harish Chatterjee Road residence.Dhankhar reached her home with his wife, Sudesh, around 6.10pm. Banerjee first took them to her modest room “for two minutes” before seating him where the puja was being performed. In the room, which is furnished with only a bed and three plastic chairs, she offered them seats on the chairs and had a brief conversation.The governor appeared visibly happy with her personal gesture, even more so when Banerjee personally took the panchapradip after sandhya-aarati to him and his wife. MP Abhishek Banerjee , who later performed yagna, also touched his feet. Several times, when Banerjee walked up to the puja to help with the rituals (she had been cooking the bhog in the morning), the governor was seen talking to Chatterjee and other state functionaries.Initially, when Banerjee introduced Chatterjee to the governor, the latter smiled and told the chief minister, “You know he has a daughter. I, too, have a daughter.”Dhankhar left at 8.20pm. He was scheduled to attend the puja ceremonies in Dakhineshwar later at night. “I am overwhelmed and touched,” he told the media before leaving.Raj Bhavan’s outreach to the CM comes after some instances of acrimonious wars of words. The wrangling match started escalating after the governor set a precedent by reaching out to the Jadavpur University campus to “rescue” Union minister Babul Supriyo during a students’ agitation. It became worse after Dhankhar expressed dismay over a “black-out” of the “first servant of the state” on TVs during the Durga Puja carnival on Red Road, and over the “absence” of senior state officials in districts, when he had sought meetings with them during his district tours. The CM, however, stayed away from the verbal duel, leaving it to party seniors — primarily Chatterjee, the party secretary-general — to respond to the governor’s remarks. But they also went silent after a point of time.The governor had sought the CM’s time on Bhatridwitiya on October 29. She she cited preoccupations on that day and welcomed him to her home for Kali Puja.Banerjee, who rarely steps out of her home since she started Kali Puja there in 1978, did not speak to the media. Senior party leaders, too, remained tightlipped about the governor’s visit.","After visiting Didi’s home, Bengal governor says he is leaving with purer heart",3079,2.208509256

PUNE: Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said revoking special status to Jammu and Kashmir was an important issue with a nationwide impact and defended making it a poll issue for the state assembly elections.Prasad's comments come in the backdrop of remarks by the opposition that the issue had nothing to do with the elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.""Do the citizens of Maharashtra have no concerns about situation in J&K? J&K is part of the country,"" he said at a press conference on Sunday.He added that the situation in J&K improved after Article 370 was repealed. ""Article 370 had become an instrument of secessionism and separatism. Why should the issue not be raised (for the state polls)?"" he said.Prasad said the Centre was making efforts to turn Pune into a smart city and, when pressed on the lack of significant impact of big ticket projects such as riverfront development and Smart Cities Mission , he said the results will take time. ""It takes time for changes to reflect. We are buliding a centre of excellence here to infuse IT in the auto sector.

Following are the six public networks that would be offered. A person can opt to connect to one of the networks depending upon his or her needs and the services the network would offer:

The Social Network

Rajiv Gandhi Free Wi-Fi : This will be the most generic offering and will be the one that was announced during the Rail Budget earlier today. After providing his or her credentials, a person will be taken to a ‘Terms & Conditions’ page where he will be asked to click ‘Yes’ or ‘Decline and travel without internet’ to a pledge accepting Shri Rajiv Gandhi as the person who brought laptop, computers, smartphones, etc. to India. After accepting this pledge, a person will be promised high speed internet.

Rahul Gandhi Youth Network : A connection that will pre-load pages such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, MTV Roadies, and HD wallpapers of celebrities on your browsing device. The government aims to impress the youth and reinforce the brand positioning of Rahul Gandhi as the Youth Icon of India through this connection. With an eye on the 2014 elections, this will be the default connection offered to a user.

Sibal Safe Link : A connection to this network will come with a guarantee of no arrests under the section 66A of the IT law. The only catch is that whatever you post on websites such as Twitter and Facebook, will be first sent to the office of Kapil Sibal for pre-screening and approval. Once the content is approved, you enjoy seamless online experience. This is being touted as the safest way to travel by Indian Railways.

Secured Secular Connection : If a user chooses to connect to this Wi-Fi network, he would be guaranteed a secular surfing experience. The connection would block access to content that could offend religious sensibilities, especially of the minorities e.g. IMDb page of Vishwaroopam or The Da Vinci Code. When Faking News tested this connection, Gujarat’s government’s official website was also blocked. We were told that it might be a bug, though no one confirmed it.

eNREGA – Surf & Earn : This network could allow a person to earn some money by posting content favorable to the government or the Congress party on social networking websites, especially Twitter. This is part of the 100 crore rupees budget (though being implemented through Rail Budget) that Congress party has decided to spend to fight the war online. Party believes that this step will make sure that they are on the railway right track.

Manmohan Singh Browser : These days some websites use background music or video ads that start playing as soon as the page loads. This becomes very irritating and people are forced to close the webpages. This connection ensures a totally silent web browsing experience. No sounds will be played when you visit a webpage. Obviously, not the best network to choose if you are a music buff.

All of the above connections are secured and accessible with a common password – “madam”.",Railways to offer six special Free Wi-Fi networks,3219,2.050326188

I renew my appeal to CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters.""""Some have asked who should vote and for what.

3318,0,"Mumbai. Members of NMS (Need More Sleep) have strongly objected to the title of Karan Johar’s latest movie “Wake Up Sid”. They feel that the title is highly provocative, derogatory and insensitive to people suffering from sleep deficits or insomnia. NMS workers, led by their president Siddharth Thackeray, called on the producer Karan Johar this afternoon and submitted a memorandum demanding immediate apology and change in the title of the movie.

“I am consulting friends, lawyers, police, pundits, doctors, bankers and family members and will decide what to do. They had come with hockey sticks to beat me up but their leader Siddharth was very generous and told them to postpone the bashing as it was International non-violence Day today. I’m touched by this display of compassion and generosity, and would do my best not to hurt the NMS guys.” Karan Johar said.

Shut the fuck up and let me sleep: NMS

NMS workers were particularly agitated over the fact that the movie title not only mocked people suffering from insomnia in general, but it showed cheeky disrespect to their president Siddharth Thackeray in particular, by asking “Sid” to wake up.

“Sid Sir hardly sleeps for more than three hours these days, and these uncouth and uncultured people are asking him to wake up! How can someone tolerate such shit? We will wait till tomorrow morning and see for ourselves if things have been set right, or we know how to set them right.” Soya Sawant, the Pune chief of NMS said.

A few film critics have found the conduct of NMS members objectionable as they felt that such acts curbed the creative freedom of an artist. These people were planning to meet Karan Johar and show solidarity but Karan has thanked them and advised them to stay put. Karan believes that creative people are bound to commit mistakes, and there is no shame in apologizing.

NMS workers had earlier searched and bashed up a doctor who had blogged about a special brand of sleeping pill that could cure insomnia and help them in their daily lives. NMS workers thought that the doctor had termed them as “sick” and was being disrespectful to them. The doctor was bed ridden for over six months. Since then most professionals and other people, including fake journalists, have preferred apologizing to NMS.","Insomniacs want Karan Johar to apologize for ""Wake Up Sid""",2285,1.794310722
3319,0,"With Narendra Modi steadfastly refusing to react to Arvind Kejriwal’s barbs, however provocative they may be, preferring instead to reserve his tirades for the Congress vice president, Arvind Kejriwal has taken the extreme step of renaming himself as Shahzada Kejriwal. The AAP leader formerly known as Arvind reckons that Modi will now be forced to acknowledge him in his forthcoming speeches by cracking ‘Shahzada’ jokes, thereby validating Shahzada Kejriwal’s contention that it’s a direct fight between BJP and AAP with Congress nowhere in the picture.

AAP volunteers were initially upset with Kejriwal’s move – after all, Shahzada connotes royalty and doesn’t sit well with the AAP ethos – but enthusiastically fell in line after Dr Yadav patiently explained that it was merely another U-turn.

Shahzada Kejriwal’s new political gambit seems to have paid dividends. In his election rally somewhere in Bihar, Modi tore into Shahzada by declaiming, “Suna hai aaj kal Shahzade Gujarat mein ghoom rahe hain aur Gujarat ki buraiyon ki ginti kar rahe hain [I hear these days Shehzade is roaming through Gujarat and enumerating its drawbacks].”

Taking a deep breath, Modi delivered the punchline: “Bhaiyon or behenon, pehle who unki dilli ki sarkar ka javab dein. Unki himmat kaise hui meri sarkar par saval uthane ka? [Brothers and sisters, first ask him to account for his government's performance in Delhi before pointing fingers at my regime].”

As soon as he delivered these lines, hordes of frenzied AAP volunteers led by the inimitable Ashutosh picketed the BJP office in New Delhi’s Ashoka Road, demanding an apology. BJP workers’ plea that Modi was referring to the original Shahzada fell on deaf ears with Ashutosh tweeting: “the Modee had inselted our Saazada and must atune for it (sic)”.

An elated Shahzada Kejriwal has now challenged Modi to engage him directly in a one-on-one debate moderated by Punya Prasoon Bajpai rather than crack lame Shahzada jokes in rallies.

A highly disappointed Anushka Sharma has threatened to have yet another lip job done and, to rub it in, appear on Koffee with Karan after that if Virat doesn’t find form with the bat soon.

“Believe me, I’m as disappointed with Virat as any other cricket fan, yaa,” Anushka fretted to The UnReal Times. “You think I get a kick out of trending for all the wrong reasons every time Virat flops with the bat? I decided enough was enough and something had to be done about it. Now the prospect of jokes about another lip job of mine trending on Twitter should give Virat the jitters and keep him on top his game.”

Anushka’s threat seems to have had its desired effect. The pugnacious Delhi lad hit the nets immediately and gave the red cherry the full treatment, mouthing expletives while at it. “He seems to be getting back to being his old angry self. If the string of expletives is an indication, he should be back among the runs,” a member of the Indian cricket team revealed on condition of anonymity.

Ace commentator Ravi Shastri felt Anushka’s threat was just what the doctor ordered. “If this threat works, and Virat scores, that’s great. If Virat flops and Anushka goes ahead with her threat, then I don’t see Virat hanging around her any longer. So, either way, in the end, cricket will be the winner,” the 1984 Champion of Champions intoned.

3321,0,"10, Janpath wore a festive look as Congress leaders, Ministers and party cadre called on Rahul Gandhi to wish him a very happy 41st birthday. Rahul Baba, who is just back after a long vacation in some foreign country, was seated on a dais along with Priyanka, Robert, Sonia Gandhi, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Visitors were segregated into 2 queues – one for aam aadmi types and the other for Ministers, MPs and celebrities. Pranab da, who was among the first to arrive, handed over a box of Mishti Doi to a beaming Rahul and proclaimed “It wash a privilege for me to sherve andarr Smt. Indira ji, Rajiv ji, and now Sonia ji. My ardent deshire eesh to sherve under Rahul ji before I become senile (sic).” There was a roar of approval and shouts of “Rahul Baba ki jai” reverberated across the precincts of 10 Janpath. A Congress worker was so overcome with emotion that he squatted in front of Rahul and started shouting “I will not budge from this place until Rahul is made the PM”. After a few minutes, he was curtly told by another worker to “not over do it” and dragged away.

Much to the crowd’s delight, Shah Rukh Khan, who was specially flown in for the occasion, made a dramatic appearance on the stage and delivered these filmi lines: “Mein to Parde ka hero hoon lekin Rahul Baba desh ka asli hero hai” to the crowd’s applause. He then enacted a scene from his upcoming movie, Ra.One, by contorting his body and sporting grotesque facial expressions. Priyanka, who was rather bored till then, clapped enthusiastically at SRK’s cameo and exhorted the crowd to watch Ra.One without fail.

Mani Shankar Aiyer, next in line, sweetly wished Rahul a very happy birthday and then barked at a rather taken aback Manmohan, “Remember, Rahul is the prince and Madam the dowager queen; You, Sir, are merely a regent serving at their pleasure. Aukaad mein rahiye!” Sonia Gandhi shot a stern glance at Mani as if to say “don’t heckle Manmohan ji”.

Another Minister gushed “Rahul ji is like a God to this Government. He may not say much in Parliament or Working Committee and cabinet meetings, but his mere presence and beatific smile is reassuring and fills us humble Ministers with hope and vigor.” Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs, Ajay Maken, facilitated Rahul by saying “Rahul ji is a youth icon and a beacon of hope for youngsters. I propose that his birthday be celebrated as National Youth Day just as Chacha Nehru’s birthday is celebrated as Children’s Day.”

The assembled workers then started pumping their fists and chanting, “Hamari maang poori karo, Rahul Gandhi ko PM banao,” and the shouting soon reached a crescendo. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, initially uncertain about how to react, also joined in the sloganeering rather animatedly. Rahul got up to pacify the crowd and said, “Shaant ho jaiye. Don’t worry, I will take over soon, when the appropriate time comes, be patient. For now, I am focused on fighting for the aam aadmi.”

The Prime Minister then got up to address the crowd. Appearing statesmen like, the Prime Minister said in a measured tone “My Government is fortunate to be lead by the Gandhi family. Rahul ji is like…” Sonia began to doze off and Rahul, by now tired with all the adulation, began to yawn. The crowd rapidly began to disperse sensing that the function was about to end. Manmohan quickly mumbled his remaining lines and sat down. Madam’s political secretary then announced that the function had ended and asked everyone to quickly vacate the premises since Rahul Baba had to rest.","Coverage of Rahul Gandhi’s 41st birthday function in 10, Janpath",3538,2.204635387

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said.","YES Bank’s Rana Kapoor approved bad loans worth Rs 20,000 crore: ED",3622,2.236333517
3323,0,"karan Johar is a big name in the Hindi film industry. Coming from a Bollywood family background helped him build his career, starting from being an assistant director to Aditya Chopra in the landmark movie Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, but Karan Johar carved a niche for himself, establishing himself as one of the topmost directors in the country. But he also is the epitome of nepotism, diplomacy, and fakeness. Karan’s PR skills are second to none and he never forgets to praise a trailer or a movie when it is released. He suffered yesterday due to this bad habit. He accidentally watched the trailer of Rock On which was released in 2008. He was so emotional that he tweeted ” Rock-On…OMGGGGGGG …the most awaited movie of the decade… Can’t wait for it to get released!!!”

Though Karan’s team later informed him that the movie was in theatres in 2008 and it was surely a major hit. Soon Karan deleted his tweet and acted if nothing has happened. Karan has been a staunch proponent of the ‘I scratch your back, you scratch mine’ theory and the same is seen in his movies. Karan Johar has also taught the same thing to all his directors and he believes that when one helps a fellow artist in the industry the brotherhood in the industry increases and it helps the industry grow.

We too believe that scratching of back happens in all the industries, but when one praises people like Bobby Deol and Tusshar Kapoor for their movies then you have taken the game too far which Karan has in real life. We can only hope that Karan learns from the current mistake and then implements the learnings in his future tweets.","Karan Johar accidentally watches the trailer of a movie released 10 years ago, calls it the most awaited movie of this decade",1615,1.424148607

We can verify the authenticity of this transcript as this was purchased directly from the members of AAPs official sting making body, which is known as KAC (Khufia Affairs Committee). Below is the full, original, unedited, and uncensored* transcript, for your enlightenment:

– Scene: Around 350 unshaven, sweaty, slightly obese men sitting around a table discussing burning issues that impact the aam admi today, like India’s exit from the World Cup and who would win the IPL. Certain MLAs could also be seen betting money even as Prasant Bhusan protested against unethical activities like cricket betting. Amidst the general din, Arvind Kejriwal stands up to begin his inaugural speech –

Arvind Kejriwal (AK): Upasthit sabhya aur asabhya mahoday, I thank you all for coming, and Admiral Ramdas for not coming, to this momentous occasion. I would like to start by saying how deeply hurt I am seeing all the muck being thrown around among party members in the past few weeks. I went to Bengaluru to get toxins removed from my system, however I fear with so much toxicity surrounding me, no natural or supernatural cure can come to my aide.

– Ashutosh is seeing trying to hold back his tears, Mayank Gandhi typing away a new blog on his laptop –

AK continues: You know, I formed this party to fight against corrupt people like Gadkari, Modi, and Arnab. But I can’t fight against my own colleagues. It is against my principles and sensibilities. Hence I believe it would be best to kick them out.

– Abruptly, he starts singing, horribly out of tune, the song ‘In The End’ by Linkin Park, to show his state of mind. Most members put on earphones, while Ashutosh, Ashish Khetan , Manish Sisodia and a few others start singing along –

AK: I can live with many things, be it chronic coughs, itchy mufflers, cold Delhi footpaths, or African women, but betrayal of trust is the one thing I can not accept. You must choose now between me or the rebels. I would want a fair voting, hence I state beforehand that anyone voting against me would face no discrimination. Though in my meeting earlier with Dalai Lama, I requested a handful of Shaolin Monks from him, in case I need to ‘control’ people indulging in ‘anti party activities’. Now if you would excuse me I have an urgent appointment with Azam Khan regarding the plight of aam buffaloes in India.

– AK stands up to exit the scene. Prashant Bhushan stands up with great alarm –

Prashant Bhushan (PB): You gaddar! We raised you, trained you! Made you who you are today! Without us you are nothing! You can’t kick us out without a fight! We want a trial by combat!

– PB picks up a chair and charges towards AK. Suddenly, two burly men appear from nowhere and promptly puts PB in his place. The men are revealed to be Jason Momoa and Dwane Jonson –

Yadav happy to come out of the meet without any injuries

Yogendra Yadav (YY) – visibly shaken – : W..who are these people?!

Manish Sisodia (MS) : They are members of the NE.

YY: What? But I’ve never seen them before!

MS: They are temporary members.. like, only for today.

PB – struggling to get up – : This is blasphemy! A murder of democracy! You are acting like the dark lord Sauron!

MS: Whatever. Enough of this shit! I propose that we kick these two, along with a few of their helpers, out of the NE. All those in favour raise their hands.

YY: Discussion! We want a discussion!!

Gopal Rai: Sure. Give us in writing. Make sure it’s at least 1000 words or more. Plus you get extra marks for judicious use of quotes and allegories.

– Meanwhile the count of hands continues. Some members, like Sisodia and Ashustosh can be seen putting up both hands –

PB: Now WTF is this!? Why are they allowed to put up both hands?!

Ashutosh: Why should we discriminate between both our hands? Do you mean to say one hand has more rights than the other? Is this the swaraj you believe in?

-Vote counting ends –

MS: 280 votes in favour, 8 votes against. Damn, this is like an India Pakistan WC match, not even close. LOL!

YY: This is all pre scripted. The drama being played out here seems to be written by Ekta Kapoor!

Gopal Rai: These are serious allegations. Do you have any proof?

YY: Proof?! You need more proof?! Why was our internal lokpal not allowed to attend the proceedings?

GR: Oh that’s simple. His term is coming to an end, so we decided to hire a new lokpal. In fact we have him here with us today. Please come in – gestures towards the door –

– To the visible shock and dismay of the rebels, ACP Pradyuman enters the hall. At this moment, the YY and PB camp realises the hopelessness of the situation and decides to make a hasty retreat –

3325,0,"BCCI may have kicked up a storm over Nasser Hussain’s donkey remark in reference to Indian fielders. But behind the scenes, the Board seems to be treating Hussain’s comment as a genuine assessment and has been moving rather swiftly to remedy the situation. “BCCI always has the best interests of Indian cricket at heart. So, while we are not afraid to pull up the ECB for Nasser’s unwarranted remark, we would also be the first to introspect and figure out who the offending donkeys are,” said Rajiv Shukla, vice-president of BCCI. “Besides, if BCCI ends up coming under RTI, this might be the first question we are asked. We gotta be ready!”

The Board has roped in strategy consulting major, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to carry out an objective assessment of the players and identify the donkeys in the team. The project, titled “Gadha kaun?” was initially supposed to begin with an attempt to understand what exactly a donkey refers to in the context of the Indian team. “It is important to understand the exact meaning of the word” said a thoughtful Rishi Suri, partner BCG. “Did Nasser Hussain mean that because of a lot of injuries, a few men were bearing the burden of the entire team, and were therefore the beasts of burden? Which would mean Dravid is the biggest donkey in the team? Or did he refer to the way the players moved about in the field and made asses of themselves? Or was Naseer subliminally thinking of Poonam Pandey’s posterior when he made the cheeky reference to donkeys?”

However, BCCI quickly cut this line of thought leaving BCG no option but to start directly with the assumption that some players may indeed be donkey-like in their approach to the gentleman’s game. BCG will now adapt its famed BCG growth-share matrix to answer the million dollar question. According to this framework, the players would now be categorized as follows:

Stars: Players whose ground fielding and catching are exceptional

Action: Teach them batting/bowling

Safe hands: Players who take catches safely but would rather die before they dive

Action: Cut down on the KFC bucket

Donkeys: Players who can’t do either even in their dreams

Action: If the player is one of the big four, spread rumours about his retirement, else kick him out.

Question marks: Players who cannot catch for nuts, but are otherwise good fielders

Action: BCG hasn’t figured out what to do with such players which is why they labelled them question marks in the first place

Players have generally reacted rather blankly to this news. However, unconfirmed reports suggest that skipper MS Dhoni is leaning on the BCG team to get Sreesanth categorized as a donkey. When asked to comment, Rishi Suri remained non-committal, and replied cryptically “Let the analysis take its course.”

3327,0,"The Shiv Sena, hitherto the poster boy of ultra-chauvinistic, extreme right wing politics, may now reinvent itself as a secular party. This comes in the wake of Uddhav Thackeray’s strident criticism of PM Narendra Modi, which has won him plaudits from the secular camp. Titans of secularism such as Nitish Kumar and Mani Shankar Aiyar are now rooting for the Shiv Sena chief to lead the forces of secularism in Maharashtra and keep the communal BJP at bay.

Nitish said he never realized that beyond Uddhav’s facade of vulgar Maratha regionalism, there lurked a highly sensitive, progressive, inclusive, secular soul that has now come to the fore. “Uddhav reminds me of myself. After years of being in a cosy arrangement with the NDA, he walks out. Why? To preserve Maharashtra’s secular fabric, to prevent that man whose name I won’t take from gaining an upper hand. He’s one of us, after all,” Nitish raved about his new found buddy. He added that the need of the hour is a maha secular alliance comprising SS, Congress, NCP, MNS and independents to form a non BJP government in Maharashtra. “I know these Chanakya guys are predicting an outright majority for BJP but they may yet be wrong. Let’s not throw in the towel as yet.”

Nitish said Uddhav’s overwhelming secularism, represented by opposition to Modi, now outweighs his other faults, such as targeting immigrants. “The politics of secularism is not easy. One has to overlook these minor faults in pursuit of the larger goal of secularism. After all, I made up with Lalu, didn’t I?” Nitish reasoned.

From the Congress side, Mani Shankar Aiyar is championing Uddhav’s case. “Initially, I thought he was a bloody lumpen fascist of the most vile kind,” Mani told The Unreal Times, “but after that chaiwallah remark [editor: Uddhav had said that if a chaiwallah can become a PM, why can’t he become a CM], I consider him up there with Rahul baba.”

The NCP for its part has deputed Rahul Navlekar to help Uddhav Thackeray learn the idiom of the secular camp and ease the transition from extreme right of centre to slightly left of centre politics.","Shiv Sena becomes secular, explores tie up with Congress, NCP to keep communal forces at bay",2104,2.376425856

Maradona had said: “Messi’s a great player, but he’s not a leader. Before talking to the coach and players, he’ll play on the PlayStation. Then, on the pitch, he wants to be the leader.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday accused PM Narendra Modi of violating the poll code through his speech at the annual NCC rally and urged the Election Commission to take note of it. Congress functionary Prithviraj Chavan said it does not behove the PM to make such remarks to impressionable minds. “Election (campaign) is going on in Delhi and the PM is making a political speech at the NCC rally.I request the EC to take it up seriously. Just because he is the PM, he cannot violate the EC rule,” Chavan said. Addressing the Annual PM’s NCC Rally 2020 on January 28, Modi had said his government had brought the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to correct “historical” injustices and recalled the Nehru-Liaquat pact to assert that the law fulfils India’s “old promise” to religious minorities in neighbouring countries. Modi also said the J&K problem had persisted since Independence with some families and political parties keeping issues in the region alive.

MUMBAI: The EC's final turnout figure for the state for Monday's polling was 61.13%, which was still less than the 63.2% in this year's Lok Sabha polls and 63.1% in the 2014 state polls. The final Mumbai figure was 50.4%, of which 48.2% was for the island city and 51.2% the suburbs.In Mumbai and across the state, an analysis of the EC's figures shows that turnout has merely dipped in a majority of the 83 seats which were with Congress-NCP. However, the voting pattern shows a big drop - up to 16% - in 10 seats, which may prove to be a swing factor.Of these 10, two constituencies are those from which the Bhujbals are contesting and another is Shirdi, contested by former opposition leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, who crossed over to BJP after the Lok Sabha polls. Nandgaon in north Maharashtra recorded a 51.2% turnout, a steep drop of 16% compared to the 67.7% in 2014. Two-time NCP MLA Pankaj is contesting for the third time from this constituency. In 2014, he had bagged over 69,000 votes while Sena and BJP, which contested separately, managed to get over 50,000 each. Since they are now contesting in alliance, it would be a cause of concern for Bhujbal.Former deputy chief minister Chhagan is contesting from Yewla, which recorded a 7% turnout fall to 63%.Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst, reminded that usually, a shrinking turnout would be a cause for concern for the sitting MLA, irrespective of whether from the ruling party or the opposition. He said anti-incumbency and the candidates' part switch may have led to the dip in turnout.In the city, the turnout at Chandivali, held by Congress' Naseem Khan, has seen a rise to 51.7% from 44.3% in 2014.The vote percentage fell by 11% in Ahmednagar (City) from 59% (in 2014) to 48%. The seat is with NCP's Sangram Jagtap, who had defeated five-time Sena MLA Anil Rathod, buoyed by the vote split between Sena and BJP in 2014. Jagtap won by a mere 3,000 votes, while Sena bagged over 46,000 votes and BJP almost 40,000. Congress stood forth rank with 27,000 votes. The Sena-BJP alliance has again fielded Rathod.The turnout was also down marginally (a shade less than 4%) in Kankavli in Ratnagiri, where incumbent Nitesh Rane has again been fielded, but this time by BJP.

I told him that our personal relations are very good and they will remain that way but it is not possible for me to work together,"" Pawar said in an interview to a Marathi TV channel on Monday.Pawar dismissed reports that Modi government offered to make him India's President. ""But there was an offer to make Supriya (Sule) a minister in the Modi-led cabinet,"" he added.Supriya Sule is Pawar's daughter and a Lok Sabha member from Baramati in Pune district.Pawar had met Modi in Delhi last month amid dramatic developments over government formation in Maharashtra.PM Modi has always praised Pawar and made it a point not to launch a vicious attack against him during the state election campaign.came last month when he was speaking on the occasion of the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha. PM Modi said other parties, including the BJP, should learn from the NCP on how to adhere to parliamentary norms.In 2016, when Modi visited the Vasantdada Sugar Institute in Pune on an invitation from Pawar, he had praised the NCP chief as an example to others in public life.""I have personal respect for Pawar.

CHENNAI: The DMK is likely to sign up poll strategist Prashant Kishor , who is working with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , to help it script a successful formula for the 2021 assembly election.Sources said the DMK is looking at the option against the backdrop of Rajinikanth's imminent entry into politics, and the 'chatter' about the superstar and MNM leader Kamal Haasan coming together for the assembly poll.While chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Kamal and Rajinikanth are believed to have consulted him, Kishor may opt to work with DMK chief M K Stalin, sources said. ""The DMK's slender victory margin of 8,000 votes in the Vellore LS poll and its defeat in the Vikravandi and Nanguneri weigh on Stalin's mind,"" said a source. Kishor, who now heads Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) and is a member of Janata Dal (United), shot to fame after he strategized for Narendra Modi in the 2014 general elections, then as Citizens for Accountable Governance'. There were indications three months ago that all was not well in DMK's OMG, the party's strategy and tech team headed by K Sunil, a former colleague of Kishor.Earlier this week, DMK leaders confirmed that Sunil tendered his resignation. Party sources said Stalin was keen on retaining Sunil while trying to get Kishor on board. But Sunil chose to end his contract after working for Stalin.Stalin had hired Sunil at the end of 2014 after DMK’s disastrous performance in the Lok Sabha elections. The J Jayalalithaa juggernaut had swept the polls, winning 37 of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu. Sunil worked with DMK for the 2016 assembly election and later left and rejoined Stalin for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the DMK won 38 of the 39 seats.""Political parties in TN now understand that brand building of politicians by poll strategists is essential in a changing political scenario that is now all about data science, technology and branding,"" said a poll strategist who did not want to be named.

However, the match only underscored the point that the real stars of the tournament are players like Dinda who ensure that irrespective of the nature of the pitch or form of the bowlers, the spectators will be treated to plenty of fireworks.

Mumbai Indians chose to bat on what, according to Ravi Shastri was an excellent batting surface (later he clarified that he meant it as just another reflexive cliché). Much to Mumbai Indians disappointment, Sachin failed to not tickle the scorers and got off to a sedate start before taking advantage of the field restrictions to hit a boundary and a six.

Even as worry lines started to appear on the faces of some CSK (or was it Mumbai Indians?) fans, Sir Jadeja got the breakthrough for the Mumbai Indians by getting rid of the Master Blaster.

Sachin Tendulkar: “Absolutely no shame in giving my wicket to Sir Jadeja” #MIvsCSK — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) May 5, 2013

Soon, wickets began to fall in regular procession with even Chris Morris sporting a Dinda-eque headband failing to induce lofty strokes from the timorous Mumbai Indians.

However, Bhajji had one of his rare ‘made it large’ moments after swatting Ashwin for a six.

After that six off Ashwin, Bhajji: “I think I’ve met expectations for this match” | Rohit Sharma: “Exceeded actually” #MIvsCSK — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) May 5, 2013

Soon it was left to Rohit Sharma to essay a twenty minute stay at the crease to steer his team to a respectable, albeit yawn inducing, score. Laughlin also brought a few moments of genuine mirth with his efforts in the last over to push towards 139. Things were getting so boring that even Ravi Shastri ran out of clichés to describe the soporific fare on display.

Meanwhile, discussions during lunch break veered around the team selection for the Champions Trophy.

Energy levels in the CSK camp was low during the innings break, with some players even suggesting that Sir Jadeja be promoted up the order to finish the match within the first 6 overs itself. MSD however would have none of it and insisted that the boys plan for a last ball finish.

Hussey accordingly tried to do his bit by repeatedly scything the ball to Pollard at point, whose fingers were still greasy after five vada paavs, spilled sitters off three consecutive deliveries. Later, this is what Rohit Sharma had to say:

Murali Vijay showed how it’s done by expertly driving away from his body to induce a thick inside edge and uprooted his off-stump. The perfect start that CSK could have hoped for.

Raina and Badrinath would depart in quick succession and it seemed that we may yet have a match on our hands.

However, Dhoni felt that it was still too easy and promoted Aswhin up the order to face up to Bhajji. Ashwin got bowled all ends up in going for a cute late cut and fans will debate for years whether it was a case of Ashwin making Bhajji look like Ashwin or Bhajji making Ashwin look like Bhajji.

Soon, Captain Cool was at the crease, with the required run rate creeping towards double digits. However, his swagger gave way to panic after he learnt that he would have to negotiate four mind numbing, mentally excruciating overs from that Ojha chap.

He immediately holed out to Pollard at long off who knew that spilling a fourth catch could invite a CBI raid. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

Sir Jadeja finally came in at a time when even Sir Jadeja would not have been able to make a difference. It was all over save for some lame Sir Jadeja jokes and a collective thoo from Chennai fans.

PATNA: Days after ally BJP’s ouster from power in neighbouring Jharkhand , JD(U) on Sunday began mounting pressure on the saffron party for a larger share of seats in the upcoming assembly polls in Bihar Allies JD(U) and BJP had contested 17 seats each in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, while remaining six seats (out of total 40) were given to the third ally Ramvilas Paswan’s LJP.“As per my understanding, there is no question of BJP and JD(U) contesting on equal number of seats in the assembly election. The seat-sharing formula of Lok Sabha cannot be justified for the state assembly polls— JD(U) is a bigger party in Bihar,” JD(U) national vice president Prashant Kishor told reporters.“Election will be contested with JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar as the face, hence the ratio of seat sharing between BJP and JD(U) cannot be 1:1. The basis of seat-sharing talks between BJP and JD(U) should be 1:1.4 or near to it. It may even be 1:1.3,” Kishor added.To justify his claim, Kishor pointed out that JD(U) and BJP had distributed seats during 2010 assembly election on the ratio of 1:1.4. “Moreover, even if the number of seats won by BJP and JD(U) in 2015 assembly election are taken into consideration, the ratio will come around 1:1.4,” he said.Kishor’s statement seeking more seats for JD(U) has created fresh ripples within NDA circles in Bihar, drawing sharp reactions from BJP leaders. BJP legislator Nitin Navin asked whether Kishor was authorised by JD(U) to speak on the issue of seat sharing. “It may be his personal opinion. Top leaders of BJP and JD(U) will sit together and discuss seat-sharing issues at the appropriate time,” Navin told reporters.Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI, “BJP believes in maintaining decorum, discipline and not to make any public statement (on seat sharing) which has only news value.

3337,0,"While the latest magnum opus from the Yash Chopra banner starring King Khan, the luscious Katrina and the statuesque Anushka Sharma is indeed based on a love story, we have it from the horse’s mouth that it will not be the usual candy flossed, mushy, romantic saga that one has come to associate Yash Chopra movies with.

On the contrary, the movie focuses on the love and affection of a middle aged father played by SRK for his young daughter (Katrina), with Anushka competing for both the protagonists’ affections as the King Khan’s chirpy grand-daughter, revealed Yash Chopra, during a tete-a-tete with The Unreal Times Bollywood correspondent, Tiger Khan, on the sets of Jab Taj Hai Jaan.

“Yaar, pak gaya romance movies banake. Kitne baar wohi love angle ko khichoonga. Give me a break, fellows. I’m over 80 now. My doctor has warned me that if I make another syrupy story like Veer Zara, then I could be done in by Type II Diabetes. So I decided to steer clear of mushy girlfriend-boyfriend stuff and have instead made this sweet father-daughter-granddaughter triangle that the whole family should enjoy, without the slightest trace of debilitating romance in it,” revealed the veteran evergreen film-maker.

Mr. Chopra clarified that the title had nothing to do with the plot as such. “Its my way of saying I’ll continue to make sugary love stories even after I become senile,” he said.

SRK added that the casting was just perfect and everyone will be in character. “Initally, when Yash uncle approached me to share screen space with Kat and Anushka, I was like ‘Uncle, yeh kuch jyaada to nahi hoga?’ After all, I am not Rajni saar to be able to act with ladies less than half my age. But Yash uncle assured me that I’ll be playing doting dad and grand-dad to these two lovelies and I felt assured after that,” disclosed the Baadshah of Bollywood.

The Indian women’s team will have to overcome big match pressure as it aims to exorcise the ghosts of the past in the T20 World Cup final against habitual winners Australia in front of a record crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. India go into the final unbeaten after topping the group stage where they had beaten the four-time champions Australia in the tournament-opener. After the semifinal against England was washed out, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad advanced to their maiden summit clash, having finished first in Group A.

The refreshing firepower of 16-year-old Shafali Verma at the top and consistency of India’s spin-heavy bowling attack has contributed massively to the team’s success so far in the competition. However, much more is needed from star batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet if India are to win their maiden ICC trophy.

The brittle middle-order too needs to deliver. And besides doing the right things on the field, India will also have to win the battle of nerves in the all important game. Australia, who had beaten India in the preceding tri-series final, find themselves in familiar territory having made their sixth successive final in seven editions. They know how to win the big moments in high-pressure games, while India have been found wanting on that front. The visitors had capitulated to England in the 2017 ODI World Cup final and 2018 World T20 semifinal.

It may be a tad unfair on the teenager but the team will expect Shafali to provide another flying start and hope this time the experienced Mandhana too fires. There can’t be a bigger stage for Harmanpreet to be back amongst the runs and lead the team from the front. If it was not for Shafali, India would have struggled to post competitive totals with the middle and lower-order doing precious little. The team did not cross the 150-run mark in the group stage but still managed to get over the line, thanks to a disciplined bowling effort.

Leggie Poonam Yadav has made a sensational comeback from a finger injury and is tournament’s leading wicket-taker with nine wickets alongside Australia pacer Megan Schutt. Pacer Shikhar Pandey too has been impressive, while left-arm spin duo of Radha Yadav and Rajeshwari Gayakwad has kept things tight. It will be interesting to see how Australians play Poonam on Sunday as the leggie was all over them in the tournament opener.

More than 75,000 tickets have already been sold for the final and the figure could go as high as 90,000, unprecedented in women’s cricket. Australia, led by Meg Lanning, are backing themselves to win in front of the home fans though a sizable number of Indian fans too is expected at the iconic MCG.

Lead men’s team pacer Mitchell Starc will also be in attendance, rooting for the home team and his wife Alyssa Healy after getting clearance to leave South Africa in the middle of the tour. Australia’s campaign has been hit by injuries to pacer Tayla Vlaeminck at the start and star all-rounder Elysse Perry was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament before the semifinal against South Africa. Despite the twin setbacks, Australia have stormed into yet another title clash.

“We’re not coming just to put on a good show. We’re coming here to win and that’s the attitude we’re going in with. It’s been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I’ve not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,” said Lanning.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said it was disappointed with the Centre for ignoring its repeated requests and yet again allocating just Rs 325 crore as Delhi’s share in central taxes . This amount has been stagnant since FY 2001-02.AAP claimed that the Centre had showed its apathy in the Budget by reducing the overall allocation for education and giving a green signal to foreign direct investment (FDI) in schools. Delhi chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal said that he had expected a larger allocation for the capital, considering that assembly elections are less than a week away.Taking a dig at BJP, which released its election manifesto on Friday, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi: “Delhi had high expectations from the Budget. But once again it has been given stepmotherly treatment by the Centre. If Delhi is not BJP’s priority, why should people vote for the party? If BJP is disappointing Delhi before the elections, will it keep promises after the elections?”Talking to reporters, deputy CM and finance minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the Budget lacked vision, was “disappointing” in the critical education sector and had “deceived” Delhiites.Disappointed with the Centre reducing the allocation for the education sector from 3.6% to 3.2%, Sisodia said, “I had expected an increase in the education budget in line with the National Education Policy, which says 6% of the GDP should be spent on this sector. The decrease clearly shows the apathy of BJP towards education.”“Allowing FDI in education is a dangerous step. BJP wants to make education a profit-making business. It also shows that BJP is only interested in giving education to a certain class of people,” Sisodia said.Sisodia said all states get a 42% share from their contribution to central taxes, but Delhi had been getting a miniscule Rs 325 crore for almost two decades. “Delhi pays about Rs 1.5 lakh crore as taxes. We had asked the Centre to enhance the share to Rs 7,000 crore to finance development projects. The Delhi budget has increased from Rs 8,739 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 60,000 crore in 2019-20. However, the share in central taxes has remained frozen at Rs 325 crore,” he added.The deputy chief minister said that despite governing the three municipal corporations, BJP didn’t earmark any funds for them. Delhi government had asked for allocation of at least Rs 1,250 crore in the 2020-21 budget estimates. “Delhi government gives 12.5% of its annual net tax collection to the local bodies, but they are not getting any financial support from the Centre,” added Sisodia.“BJP had in the 2017 municipal corporation polls declared that the local bodies would get funds directly from the Centre. What happened to their promise? Was it another jumla?” Sisodia asked.Claiming that the new income tax slabs for the salaried class were complicated, Sisodia said people won’t be able to save anything from their hard-earned money.","Union Budget 2020: Delhi gets stepmotherly treatment, says Arvind Kejriwal",3392,2.41745283

New Zealand’s Kim Cotton and Pakistan’s Ahsan Raza were on Friday named on-field umpires for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

Four-time champions Australia will take on first-time finalists India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

The 42-year-old Cotton stood in Australia’s semi-final victory over South Africa at the SCG, with the match in Melbourne set to be her fifth of the tournament, the ICC said in a statement.

“Cotton will be joined on the field by Pakistan umpire Raza who, like his colleague, is standing in the Final for the very first time,” it said. Raza was due to officiate in India’s washed-out semi-final with England, while his experience of India-Australia contests stretches back to the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 semi-final.

Supporting the on-field umpires will be West Indies’ Gregory Brathwaite, who will be the TV umpire.

Zimbabwe’s Langton Rusere, on-field official for the 2018 Final, will be fourth umpire this time around while Chris Broad of England will oversee the game as match referee.","Women’s T20 World Cup final: NZ’s Kim Cotton, Pak’s Ahsan Raza confirmed as umpires for India vs Australia match",1157,2.679343129
3343,0,"In a move that is likely to endear him to many of his countrymen, including Biharis, MNS chief Raj Thackeray has called for a nationwide ban on Shirish Kunder’s ‘Joker’ starring Akshay Kumar.

Speaking to the media just after catching the matinee show at the Ad Labs theatre in Andheri West, a shaken MNS supremo said, “Please forgive me for my previous remarks against Biharis and Hindi channels. Only after watching Joker today, did I realize the extent to which such movies can scramble one’s brains and cause him or her to do and say arbitrary things. In fact, I now believe that my delusional call for eviction of Biharis from Maharastra can be completely blamed on Akshay’s previous movie, Rowdy Rathore, where the hero hailed from Bihar.”

Pausing to take a deep breath, Raj Thackeray added, “For the sake of the collective sanity of not just the Marathi Manoos, but Indians from every corner of the nation, I call for a ban on ‘Joker’. We are also ready to patch up with Shah Rukh khan and apologize for the trouble we created during the release of My Name Is Khan, if the Baadshah is ready to slap Shirish Kunder once again on behalf of the nation.”

Within hours of his statement, support poured in for Thackeray’s demand from all parts of the country. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said, “We might have had our differences in the recent past, but on this occasion, I’d like to add that Raj is absolutely right; national sanity is too precious a thing to be put in jeopardy. The JD(U) and the Bihar government fully supports the MNS in this regard.”

Meanwhile, in New Delhi, the Parliament functioned smoothly for the entire day for the first time in weeks, as the Congress and the BJP quickly decided to put the debate on the Coal scam on hold for the time being, and got together to pass an immediate resolution seeking a ban on the film. Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh said, “Given that this movie is a bigger joke than even me, we must put aside our political differences and unite to do whatever it takes to rescue this nation.”

Raj Thackeray is now expected to hold another march to Mumbai’s Azad Maidan and hold a massive rally against the movie and its maker Shirish Kunder. The rally is expected to see the participation of over 2 lakh MNS supporters, hardcore Bollywood fans and occasional cinema-goers who were caught unawares last weekend. The Mumbai police, in a departure from its position vis-a-vis Raj’s rally against illegal immigration, has already given him permission for the march, and has in fact indicated that many of its policemen would join his protest.","Raj Thackeray demands ban on “Joker”, receives support from Bihar govt.",2607,1.802838512

BENGALURU: Last May, BS Yediyurappa had to step down as chief minister within 56 hours of being sworn-in after Supreme Court gave him a day to prove his majority in the assembly. This July, he became chief minister after a dramatic vote count in which the JD(S)-Congress government collapsed after 17 MLAs of the ruling combine defected to BJP.Yediyurappa needed this big bypoll victory to legitimise his rule as in the last year and half it often looked as if he had lost his touch. The new spelling of his name (it was earlier Yeddyurappa) has obviously brought him good luck as BJP on Monday swept the polls winning 12 of the 15 seats. It must be particularly satisfying to him that it has resulted not only in the humbling of his rivals but also in the resignations of Siddharamaiah and Dinesh Gundurao from leadership roles in Congress. That the H D Deve Gowda family has drawn a blank in its heartland of Mandya must be particularly gratifying.The 76-year-old Lingayat strongman’s ‘Man of the Match’ performance has once for all quelled all rumours of the BJP leadership planning to ‘retire’ him. This strong performance strengthens him and he will now have a fairly free hand in running the state as the earlier appointment of three deputy CMs was seen as an attempt by the BJP high command to rein him in.It is widely believed that it was Yediyurappa’s promise to make the disqualified MLAs ministers after their victory that turned the tide for BJP. They worked extra zealously to return to the assembly as their entire political careers were at stake.Said political analyst M N Patil: “What remains to be seen is two things: One, how he handles them in the cabinet and how he handles the growing frustration among loyal party leaders and ministerial aspirants. The second aspect would be the most critical from now on.”",Karnataka bypoll results: New spelling of BS Yeddyurappa brings him much-needed luck,2258,1.505757307
3345,0,"Following longstanding atrocious commentary by Sunil Gavaskar, a PIL was today filed in the Supreme Court to prohibit Sunil Gavaskar from commenting on Cricket matches. The notorious serial PIL petitioner and Supreme Court advocate ML Sharma cited news reports of increasing depression related suicides in the country following India’s cricket matches.

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics reveal that a total of 1,35,445 people committed suicide in 2012 which amounts to a an average of 15 suicides an hour or 371 suicides daily.

ML Sharma cited data from an Indian NGO ‘India against Sunny’ which showed that suicides in the one hour after India’s cricket-matches in which Sunil Gavaskar commentated have averaged 21, which is 40% higher than normal. However, in matches that India also lost, the growth was even higher at 60% meaning 23 persons committing suicide in the one hour after the match.

[Full Disclosure: The Unreal Times runs the ‘India against Sunny’ NGO and donations are welcome in the form of hard cash or a new LCD screen for our office.]

The petition was also signed by Indian cricketers like Shikhar Dhawan who blamed Gavaskar’s absolutely mindblowingly atrocious ‘joke’ for his dismissal in the match against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. Sunil Gavaskar tried an elaborate joke mixing Mongia’s “Aigo” and some crap on Pak bolwer Talha which was so atrocious it even messed up the International Space Station for a few minutes.

One unnamed ex-Indian player said, “Sunny thinks up a joke, sedates it before letting it out and chokes it to death while telling it. That’s how he has always been.”

Some of the big West Indian players are also learnt to have signed the petition blaming him for massacring the West Indian accent and making unsuspecting people their country for no reason.

When reached for a comment, Sunil Gavaskar managed to further depress our already depressed and unpaid correspondent FML Freida by pulling West Indies accent again. He started saying, “O Maaan! This is nonsense, my maan. I don’t hurt no hurt nobody, my maan. When I was in Weeest Indies, they bowl bonser, my maan…” We are proud of Freida for pulling through without slitting her wrist for the 13th time.

3346,0,"New Delhi. The decision of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to arrange a beer party with Bollywood actor Emraan Hashmi and members of the housing society that allegedly refused Emraan a house for being a Muslim, has run into troubled waters. Although the decision was touted as a great step towards fostering communal harmony in the society, the same is now turning into a slugfest for religious beliefs.

Religious Profiling?

Manmohan Singh’s original plan was to invite Emraan, members of the housing society, Mumbai Police officials, and a few religious leaders like Baba Ramdev from Hindu and Muslim sects over a beer party to discuss issues like religious discrimination of minorities. Prime Minister’s Office had claimed that Emraan would happily end up buying a house in the same society and all the religious leaders would jointly issue a statement appealing peaceful cohabitation of all Indians.

Prime Minister’s decision faced its first criticism when some Muslim groups objected to the presence of liquor based beverages in a party attended by as pious a Muslim as Emraan. These groups issued a fatwa that Emraan and other religious leaders would be boycotted by the Muslim society if they attended a party espousing consumption of liquor.

Before Emraan and others could react, Hindu groups retaliated with threats of mass agitation if Prime Minister succumbed to the unrealistic demands of Muslims. These groups lamented the culture of Muslim appeasement in India and insisted that not only liquor, pork should also have been a part of the menu of the beer party.

Although Baba Ramdev didn’t agree with such Hindu groups, he agreed that serving beer was a bad idea. Baba thought that beer made a person queer which had given rise to homosexuality in India. He instead suggested a joint yoga session of Emraan and the housing society members to ward off the differences. Sources inform that Baba Ramdev might throw his own party.

If these religious protests were not enough, liquor baron Vijay Mallya also joined the chorus and lambasted the PMO for having approached the Australian beer company Fosters for serving beer at the proposed party. Mallya accused the government of being insensitive towards domestic industries and declared that he would plan for a ‘beer black out’ on 18th August when all private airlines including his Kingfisher Airlines would go on a strike seeking a government bailout.

Following these reactions, PMO is in a fix over what to do with the proposed beer party. Emraan Hashmi too has gone into hiding and sources close to him say that he has dropped his plans to buy any house for the time being. Police arrested some Hindu and Muslim activists outside his house planning some kinds of protests. Fearing a public backlash, Prime Minister has appealed for communal harmony and suspended his beer party indefinitely.",Outrage over Prime Minister’s beer party with Emraan Hashmi,2859,1.084295208

Product placement according to the Business Dictionary is, “an advertising technique used by companies to subtly promote their products through a non-traditional advertising technique, usually through appearances in film, television, or other media”.

Samsung India, the electronics major has taken this to new exciting and innovative level by signing up a political party for product placement. Samsung has issued a press release proclaiming this to be the first-of-its-kind deal in the entire world. “AAP’s commitment levels which border on obsession with LG, our main competitor, makes this tie-up natural,” declared the Samsung press release. Samsung claimed that the AAP cadre and supporters think and live the brand Samsung in every mode of life by blaming LG for each and every shortcoming under the sun, which works in their favour. Under this tie-up, AAP has committed to blame LG for at least 20 issues plaguing them in each national debate/discussion/press conference. The issues range from dengue and chikungunya, which are caused due to the defective drainage systems of LG washing machines, to deaths occurring during heat waves arising out of inefficient LG air-conditioners.

Talking to the media at the well-attended press conference, ex-pressman and now a senior leader of AAP, Ashutosh said, “LG has been responsible for so many issues which plague the Aam Aadmi. The hike in inflation too is due to the higher demand of food due to LG refrigerators which are not as efficient as Samsung.” “Our visionary leader Arvind has yet again proved his mental by committing to changing the way advertising is done in India after changing the way politics are done in India,” he further added.

From manifesto promises to build cow shelters and starting commercial production of cow urine; to statue inaugurations and chief ministers busy making headlines for changing city names rather than changing policy, the political rhetoric this election season is a sad reminder of one of the greatest empirical puzzles of India’s democracy. Why has a democracy, as deeply entrenched and competitive as ours, where the poor vote in far greater numbers than the rich, failed to produce a politics of accountability for the delivery of public goods and services? In other words, why do elections routinely fail in generating meaningful debate on the quality of public services and election results rarely an evaluation of policies and manifesto promises?

This is not to suggest that Indian democracy has failed to produce a politics of welfare. Far from it. In fact I would go so far as to say that welfare schemes are a site of serious political competition. This is best evidenced in the Modi government’s approach to welfare. For all its initial rhetoric on jobs and aspirations, this government has invested significant political capital to take the welfare mantle away from its predecessor, the UPA, by consistently launching grandiose new schemes and renaming old ones — so much so that many, including this newspaper, have argued that the 2019 election is likely to be a welfarist or populist election, focused on the delivery of goods and services and other benefits.

The problem is that this politics of welfare remains restricted to a politics of launching schemes and promises of future hand-outs rather than of undertaking systemic reforms to ensure effective delivery. Lack of political will is a standard trope trotted out in almost every popular and academic debate on the quality of public services in India. The problem, as political scientists Devesh Kapur and Aditya Dasgupta have argued, lies in the fact that while the electoral returns to announcing new schemes are clear, the returns on investments in strengthening state institutions to ensure schemes are implemented well are far more diffused. This is why even ostensibly simple investments, such as staffing India’s chronically under resourced local administration, are rarely a political priority.

The problem of incentives is compounded by the fact that the nature of reforms needed to improve public services and meet voter aspirations is increasingly more complex. Improving education, for instance, is no longer about building a school. Rather it is about creating institutional systems that improve learning quality. This is a complex reform for which there are no clear pathways or short term quick fixes and thus no immediate political gains.

In the absence of incentives to invest in implementation, during elections, the politics of welfare is inevitably reduced to a political competition for populist hand-outs and cash. This is what political scientists have termed “vote buying”.

Why do voters respond to vote buying strategies? And what will it take to shift the needle toward a more robust politics of welfare implementation in India? These are questions that political scientists have long puzzled over. A recent paper by Oliver Heath and Louise Tillin, based on a survey of voters in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, offers some important insights relevant for the season’s elections.

Chhattisgarh, under Raman Singh, as has been widely documented, undertook serious institutional reforms to substantially improve the delivery of the public distribution system and the MGNREGA. These reforms were crucial to the Raman Singh government’s bid for political legitimacy and managing the social costs associated with opening the state to the extractives industry. Madhya Pradesh (MP), on the other hand, under Shivraj Singh Chouhan, adopted an agriculture-focused rather than welfare-led reform agenda.

Exploiting these differences, Heath and Tillin ran an experimental survey to understand voter choices. They found that voters residing in the relatively better functioning institutional context of Chhattisgarh were less responsive to small-scale “vote-buying” strategies compared to their neighbours in MP. These differences blurred as the size of the hand-out increased (from food to jobs) but the fact that voters were making different choices in Chhattisgarh holds important lessons. Voters are susceptible (likely to vote in favour of) to “buying” tactics when institutions are weak and voter confidence in the ability of governments’ to deliver public goods is low. Quite frankly, this is only rational.

Ironically, the only way to break this cycle, as Chhattisgarh’s voters indicate, is if politicians are willing to invest in institutional reforms. Sadly, if the current election rhetoric is anything to go by, our politicians, even those in Chhattisgarh, who have the opportunity to build on their own success, have failed to recognise the potential for change. The 2019 polls will be fought in the grammar of populist vote-buying and dangerous communalisation. But can we wish for a different election in 2024?

Looking radiant in a crisp yellow handloom sari and a comely T-shirt blouse, Priyanka declaimed that her charisma will increase even further in the years to come, sending the throng assembled in Amethi into a tizzy.

“The opposition has been trying to sway the masses by talking about lack of growth, corruption under UPA regime, my husband’s shady business practices and other such non-issues,” she said in a voice laced with emotion, “but people are too mature and sensible to get fooled by such invidious propaganda. They have full faith in the Nehru-Gandhi charisma and so will give the UPA another five years…” A wave of claps and whistles from the crowd drowned her voice.

Priyanka said the people of Amethi could always count on her to be around for them. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll settle into comfortable domesticity after the elections and resurface in 2019 to address another set of rallies, by which time, I would have become even prettier,” she said, waving at the crowd.

Congress leaders haven’t stopped raving about Priyanka ever since her interventions. “What grace, what charm, she’s galvanized the rank and file with her mere presence. Patriotism may be the last refuge of a scoundrel but Priyankaji’s charisma is the last refuge for any bona fide Congressman,” a leader said. “As long as Priyankaji is with us, there is no place for the likes of Karisma Kapoor in our party,” raved another. “She’s so charismatic that we believe Hero Honda has requested her to endorse their new model in the Karizma series,” swooned another Gandhi family loyalist.

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in for a third consecutive term as chief minister of Delhi, along with his cabinet, by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Sunday afternoon at Ramlila Maidan as a capacity crowd cheered. Addressing the people later, he attributed his overwhelming victory to the common man of Delhi, making the Aam Aadmi Party ’s “new kind of politics” the centrepiece of the celebrations.“The people of Delhi have given birth to new politics in the country. This is the politics of work — schools, hospital, 24-hour and cheap power supply, water, good roads, women’s security, a corruptionfree city — politics of 21st century India,” he said, in remarks that were the closest he came to making a national pitch. He said this had started resonating across the country and other states were either emulating it or being denied any reason not to do so with people asking, “If Delhi can do it, why can’t you?”In an apparent gesture to people migrating to the city, he told those already here to call up their villages and say, “Hamara beta CM ban gaya dobara, chinta ki koi baat nahi hai” (Our son has become the CM again, there’s no need to worry). This was a direct call to AAP’s support base in slums and unauthorised colonies.He defended AAP’s freebies — free power, water, bus rides for women etc — with the remark: “Everything precious in the world created by God is free...Kejriwal loves people of Delhi and they love Kejriwal. This love is also priceless.” He added: “Do I start charging people for education and health? Do I start charging patients for their operations? That is not possible.”Kejriwal began his address with a full-throated cry of “Bharat mata ki jai, Inquilab zindabad and Vande mataram”. He was conciliatory in his demeanour, saying they had a lot of work to do in order to bring prosperity and happiness to people in the next five years and he would not discriminate between supporters of different parties. “I am everyone’s CM,” he declared.Kejriwal said the elections were over and he had forgiven the opposition for the remarks made against him during campaigning.I want to work together with all parties for development of Delhi. I want to work with the central government to take Delhi forward and make it a world-class city,” he said. In this regard, he sought the blessings of the PM and central government.The high-octane political canvassing ahead of the assembly polls had seen at least two senior BJP leaders, including a Union minister, calling Kejriwal a “terrorist”, forcing AAP run a counter campaign dubbing him the “son” of Delhi.But, in an oblique reference to the debate over nationalism, he linked the honour of the Tricolour fluttering in the wind to education, health, women’s safety, jobs, happiness for farmers and, finally, people rising above caste and religion to take India forward.Kejriwal ended his address with the Hindi version of “We shall overcome” i.e “Hum honge kamyab”, urging the crowd to sing with him. This was followed by a reiteration of “Bharat mata ki jai, inquilab zindabad, vande mataram”.The atmosphere at Ramlila Maidan — the epicentre of the India Against Corruption movement which witnessed the birth of AAP in November 2012 and where Kejriwal and his council of ministers were sworn in in 2013 and 2015 too – was charged up as the chief minister-designate and his six ministers took oath of office and secrecy.Vijender Gupta, who was leader of the opposition in the outgoing assembly, was the only person from the opposition to attend though many invitations had gone out.Along with Kejriwal, his team of six ministers repeated from the last term — Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Pal Gautam – also took oath of office. Deviating from the format of ministers taking the oath in the name of God, Rai and Gautam took the oath in the name of “martyrs of the freedom movement” and “Tathagata Buddha”, respectively.The swearing in ceremony — chief secretary Vijay Dev reading out the notification of the President of India appointing the chief minister and his council of ministers followed by the LG making them take the oath of office and secrecy — lasted barely 18 minutes.On either side of the dais were sitting ‘Dilli ke 50 Nirmata’ (50 creators of Delhi), selected by AAP from diverse backgrounds for their contribution to the “development” of the city. Drawn from diverse backgrounds — woman driver of metro, doctors at mohalla clinics, bus marshalls, farmers, anganwadi workers, autowallahs etc — some of them were profiled in TOI on Sunday. This underlined AAP’s theme that it was a people’s government.“Who are these creators (nirmatas)?” the CM posed to the crowd. “Delhi is not run by Kejriwal, politicians or parties. It is run by its teachers, doctors, autorickshaw drivers, rickshaw-pullers, students, bus drivers, conductors, vendors, businessmen and factory owners,” he explained, underlining the role of the aam aadmi.“I am happy that we have with us Vijay Kumar, who is studying at IIT. After passing out, he will serve the country. The future of the country depends on such youth,” said Kejriwal. “We have Dalbir Singh from Najafgarh. He is a retired teacher and earlier built the future of children. He is a farmer now and grows grains for you. We have Nidhi Gupta with us. You travel in the Metro to office and back, and she runs the Metro. She is a Metro pilot.”Arvind Kejriwal’s parents, wife Sunita, daughter Harshita and son Pulkit were present at the ceremony. Other family members of Kejriwal who attended the ceremony included Sunita Kejriwal’s sister and mother and the CM’s brother and aunt. AAP MLAs and MPs also turned up with their family members and were seated in the enclosure in front of the main dais.This will be Kejriwal’s third term as CM. Sheila Dikshit of Congress has had three complete tenures as Delhi CM between 1998 and 2013. Kejriwal’s first term in December 2013 was curtailed to 49 days when his minority government, propped up by Congress from outside, resigned on the issue of Jan Lokpal Bill.After a year of President’s Rule, AAP recorded a massive victory in February 2015, winning 67 seats in the 70-member House. Kejriwal retur ned to for m a gover nment in the national capital and completed his first full term in office. The party returned to office with yet another huge mandate winning 62 seats in the polls last week.

“Let’s face it. This eej Bihar, baby! The absolute vortex of caste politics! All parteej, irrespective of what they say in public, feel deep down that it eej the one and only key to crack elections over here! So to make life eajier for us aj well aj the people, we might aj well have the candidates’ castes on the EVMs instead of their names,” RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav told The UnReal Times. “Let the EC do this much. Nothing can stop us from coming to power then, unless someone from our alliance eats biscuits during a solar eclipse,” Lalu added.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar too echoed his ally’s views, stating that it would make the voting process far simpler. “Sasure ne kamaal ki baat kahi! I absolutely agree with Laluji and I’ve signed his petition. I have Bihar’s entire caste, sub-caste and Maha-caste details at my fingertips and if only the EC accedes to our demand, the BJP will be buried alive,” Nitish added. In addition to castes, JDU chief Sharad Yadav also highlighted that women with good bodies should have that fact indicated on the EVM.

Psephologists and opinion poll agencies have, however, perceived this as a veiled strategy by the Janata Parivaar to attract Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav back to their fold. “Mulayam Singh is a Yadav. The Janata Parivaar is a mini Yadav-hub, with 2 Yadavs at the fore. Mulayam is also famous for U-turns. With an attempt to make this caste on EVM thing a reality, it all adds up.” said C-Voter chief Yashwant Deshmukh. “But they also have the option of wooing the currently out-of-the-reckoning Yogendra Yadav, so it’s a real, no holds barred potboiler. Anything’s possible!” Deshmukh added.

The BJP, meanwhile, has been left clueless at the petition. “Honestly, I don’t care, yaar. Nobody knows any of us over here. People only know Modiji. I don’t even know why we’re fighting this election,” said Sushil Modi.

The petition also found support from some quarters of the media, with India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai seeming to tweet in support of it. “Just imagine if this caste-on-EVM thing happened in Delhi too!

BEED: When the long arid spell scorched his soyabean field, 38-year-old Sudhakar Kadam did not have the strength to carry on. Already struggling with a Rs 2-lakh loan taken to dig a well, the farmer was left with nothing to fall back on. He hung himself in his field in Patoda's Saundana village on August 28.His widow Vimal has become a farm labourer, often joined by her three children. ""Sometimes when I miss school for 2-3 days, I lose track of what has been taught,"" says her 13-year-old daughter Pallavi.Across the driest districts in Marathwada , which was overlooked by the plentiful monsoon this year, distress is palpable. The belt has suffered three droughts in the last five years. This year, the rainfall was only 73% of normal with Beed, Latur and Osmanabad districts the worst affected.Till the end of September, Marathwada had witnessed 656 farmer suicides. Across Beed district, the soyabean and cotton crop is stunted and farmers cannot even hope for half their regular yield. Many like Akash Gundre in Ambajogai have not received the state government's farm loan waiver or crop loan. He plans to quit farming and work as a labourer. ""I cannot afford another year of losses,"" he says.Yet the unrelenting crisis here may not translate into an electoral setback for the ruling parties. The endemic distress in the region has been cushioned by the delivery of Central schemes aimed at providing crop insurance, toilets and housing. The lack of a strong campaign by the Opposition has also left voters floundering for options.In Naigaum village, BJP's campaign pitch on scrapping Article 370 draws mixed reactions. ""How does Kashmir affect our lives?"" asks a cynical Vidya Rudraksh from Ambajogai. But farmers say the payouts they have received from the crop insurance scheme after the 2018 drought have given them some hope. Beed district received payouts worth Rs 1,300 crore for last year's kharif crop, according to the district collector's office.Alif Patna, who spent Rs 500 for crop insurance last year, received Rs 9,000 for his 9-acre field. More prosperous farmers like Manish Rudraksh who bought higher insurance have drawn greater benefits. Rudraskh spent Rs 8,000 on crop insurance for his 20-acre field and received a payout of over Rs 1 lakh.In Shirur village, Sunita Ingale's family knows their field will get barely any yield this year but she is happy with the toilet they have built with the Rs 12,000 subsidy they received under the Centre's Swachch Bharat scheme. ""The toilet does not work through the year. We use it when there is water but at least at that time, women don't have to relieve themselves in the fields,"" says Sunita.The rural housing scheme has also found resonance among the villagers of Shirur. Bhimrao Ingale lives in a mud hut. He and his brother have been sanctioned a house under the Prime Minister's Awas Yojana, which entitles them to a subsidy of Rs 1.5 lakh. The delivery of Central schemes is a reason why on the ground, the image of Prime Minister Modi is stronger than that of the state government.There are many, however, who have not received anything from the government. In Patoda, an irate Rukmini Ankush Kadam says she will boycott the elections. ""We have not received money for a house, toilet or even gas from the government. Why should I vote for them?"" she asks bitterly. Yet for farmers like Akash Gundre, even the hope of receiving a payout is enough. ""I did not receive anything from the government but others did. Maybe in the future, I will too,"" he says.",Marathwada drought impact cushioned by Delhi schemes,3798,2.790942601

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

3355,0,"Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma may have proclaimed last Friday that the nation wants to see Rahul Gandhi as the Prime Minister, but an ongoing nationwide poll conducted by The UnReal Times suggests that Verma himself is the preferred choice.

According to the current results of the ongoing poll, an overwhelming 60% of the population wants Beni Prasad Verma as the Prime Minister. In second place is Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh, with 35% preferring him for the top job while 4% want cricket commentating legend Ravi Shastri ensconced in 7, Race Course Road. 1% of the sample voted for random options, some of which included Rahul Gandhi, Ram Gopal Varma, Sagarika Ghose and so on.

Throwing more light on the tentative results, The UnReal Times correspondent and expert political analyst, Rajniti Sarkarwala, said, “Well, the readers of The UnReal Times obviously want to make sure they’re thoroughly entertained for another 5-year term. This can happen only if you have a joker at the helm and who better than Beni Prasad Verma? Also, jokes apart, he will make sure that the country always sees the positives in everything – like, for example, how high inflation is good for farmers, how religion-based reservations can help reduce riots, how a scam is not to be treated seriously unless it is above INR 71 crore and so on. Such policies will make sure that large portion of the prevailing negativity and pessimism is wiped away. Who knows, Beni might even say – terrorism is good for the army as it makes sure they work for their money, if he becomes the PM! As for Rahul Gandhi, our readers probably think that he will anyway provide countless moments of levity as the eternal No.2 in the party, irrespective of whatever formal position he assumes. So that explains why people don’t really want to see him in the Prime Minister’s post.”

Throwing light on the surprising support for Diggy’s candidature, Sarkarwala said “Well, Beni is often referred to as Digvijaya Singh part 2, although the poll results indicate otherwise. Again, it’s a question of fodder – Diggy provides some of the basic fodder necessary for satire websites to run and with him as the PM, The UnReal Times has lot of material to work with. There’ll never be a drought of jokes.”

Coming to the third preference, Rajniti explained, “I’m not at all surprised by Ravi’s strong showing. As any student of politics knows, it’s about mouthing clichés such as ‘we are determined to eradicate poverty’ or ‘we are confident of getting back to a high growth trajectory’. And Shastri can deliver such bromides with much greater finesse and aplomb. If he becomes the PM, readers can be assured of an article every single day by Shastri’s greatest fan, columnist Ashwin Kumar. In fact, when he informed Ravi about these results, the latter is supposed to have said, ‘Well, I justtt get the feeling this poll could go all the way down to the wire, Ashwin. At this stage, all four results are possible’ (sic).”

The political analyst also explored other choices, adding ,”Those who voted for Ram Gopal Varma have probably done so, in the intention that it keeps him away from making movies for 5 years at least. Similarly, those who voted for Sagarika Ghose want Face The Nation to end ASAP and want her to really face the nation. However, jokes apart, a few optimistic voters also wanted well-known economist and former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh to be given a chance at the Prime Minister’s post.”","Nationwide poll reveals Beni Prasad, Diggy, Ravi Shastri as nation’s top choices to become next PM",3489,2.206936085

There was Sachin Tendulkar, there was Virender Sehwag, there was Brian Lara and a stadium full of nostalgia during the India legends vs West Indies legends match in Road Safety World Series at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The Tendulkars, Sehwags, Zaheers and Laras rolled the clock backwards by producing a spectacle on Saturday evening. And in that spectacle, the Indian legends shown brighter as they emerged victorious thanks to a blistering opening stand between Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.

Right from the moment the Sachin-Sehwag opening combination made their way into the centre - climbing down the stairs and slowly strolling their way into the lush green Wankhede outfield - the familiar ‘Sachin-Sachin’ chants engulfed Mumbai and it continued till the time the little master was at the crease.

Like old times, amid the Sachin-frenzy, Sehwag made everyone took notice by smacking the first two balls of the India legends to the boundary.

Sehwag (74 not out; 11x4) played all the shots in the book, including the traditional late cut, while Tendulkar (36;7x4) executed drives, upper cuts and stepped out to spinners, something he did with majestic grace all through his illustrious career.

Tendulkar hammered Suleiman Benn for three successive fours to light the stadium.

And as was the case earlier, the legend’s dismissal brought about ‘pin drop’ silence in the stadium.

After Mohammed Kaif (14) and Manpreet Gony (0) fell, Sehwag, in the company of Yuvraj Singh (10 not out), chased the 151-run target as the hosts won by 7 wickets.

Earlier, India Legends restricted WI Legends to 150/8 with pacers Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbing two wickets.

Opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 61 (6x4; 2x6).

Brian Lara (17; 4x4), in his brief stay at the crease, showed the crowd why he is considered among the finest to have ever wielded the willow.

Zaheer’s one-handed stunner was also one of the talking points of the day.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh.",PM Modi to take part in Sheikh Mujib’s birth centenary through video conference,2350,1.446808511
3359,0,"Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. After Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and Union Minister Shashi Tharoor expressed unhappiness over Parvez Rasool not being included in any ODI cricket match against Zimbabwe, Virat Kohli, Indian captain for the current tour has asked for more matches so that he can give the Kashmiri player a chance.

“Normally I show middle finger to those who give me unnecessary advice, but these folks are very powerful and influential,” Virat Kohli explained to Faking News why he has asked BCCI to extend the super-boring Zimbabwe tour.

On being asked why he didn’t include Rasool even though India had won the series, Kohli said, “Yaar, this is not the first time some cricketer has warmed bench for the entire series. Look at Rahane.”

Kohli thinking what all responsibilities captain of an Indian cricket team has

But he quickly added that he regretted his decision of not playing Rasool in any of the matches.

“Who knows, next time there is any stone-pelting in Kashmir, these politicians and experts will blame me for destroying relationship between Kashmir and rest of India!” Kohli expressed his deepest fears.

Although candid, a usual aggressive and flamboyant Kohli appeared very nervous and apologetic over the whole issue while talking to Faking News.

“I knew that cricket diplomacy works between India and Pakistan and we cricketers are expected to do what our politicians fail to do, but didn’t know that domestic relations too were our responsibility,” Virat said.

“Blame it on my experience, maybe Dhoni would have handled it better,” he wondered.

“He is better at handling controversies. See, he kept mum on the fixing issue, and handled the controversy like Prime Minister does. But I just can’t keep silent!” Kohli added.

Sources say that BCCI is in a fix on how to handle the issue. The India-Zimbabwe tour has failed to attract attention of people, except that of Omar Abdullah and Shashi Tharoor.

“With only two viewers, even though influential public figures, we may not get enough sponsors. Even Celkon mobile will refuse now!” a BCCI source revealed.

Meanwhile unconfirmed sources suggest that Virender Sehwag has approached a Khap Panchayat in Najafgarh to agitate on his behalf and ask for his inclusion in the team.

Rasool refused to comment.

3360,0,"The Australian Cricket Board has declared Shane Warne as the Australian Cricketer of the Year for 2011 for ‘finally managing to get on top of a pommie and more than making up for the Ashes debacle’. “Things were looking bad after England walloped us in the 2010-11 Ashes but Warne’s off-field conquest of English supermodel, Liz Hurley, has brought back smiles to the faces of Australian cricket fans and for this, he is our Australian Cricketer of Year,” announced Cricket Australia CEO, James Sutherland.

Australian PM, Julia Gillard, was even more fulsome in her praise for the leg spin wizard. “I don’t really follow Test Cricket but from what I gather, Shane bowled with commendable discipline over many sessions and finally had Liz stumped with a well flighted googly. If Warne continues in this vein, I am sure we will regain the Ashes,” said Ms. Gillard.

Australian cricketing greats have also lauded the move. “Warne did not just bag another English bunny, he did so by edging out an Indian competitor. So it was doubly satisfying,” noted Richie Benaud, alluding to Hurley dumping her India born husband, Arun Nayar for the former Australian Test cricketer. “Shane played hard and fair, and was rewarded in the end for his perseverance. And the best part is he did not even have to resort to any sledging in this particular match,” observed former team mate, Steve Waugh, who believes that Warne’s romantic conquest exemplifies the doughty, playing-to-win approach of Australian cricketers.

Cricket Australia will mark this achievement with a victory parade through the streets of Melbourne where Warne will showcase his ‘trophy fiancé’ to an adoring public. Newly anointed Test skipper, Michael Clarke, has also requested Cricket Australia to hire Shane Warne as the new coach to help the team get back to winning ways. “Warnie’s tips to become more metrosexual under Liz’s guidance should help the boys regain confidence both on and off the field. That should help us become the number 1 team in the world again,” remarked Pup, who is increasingly regarded as a tactically shrewd and cerebral captain.",Shane Warne declared Australian Cricketer of the Year for successfully wooing Elizabeth Hurley,2115,1.985815603
3361,0,"In every speech of his, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi makes it a point to compare India to something or the other, be it a beehive or a computer or a bouquet. As the Nehru-Gandhi scion gives more speeches to varied audiences, he will be expected to tailor his message to adequately resonate with the segment he wants to reach out to. Keeping this in mind, here are ten things which the Nehru-Gandhi scion could liken the country to in his future speeches:

1. At a G-20 summit: India is like T-20 cricket

I’m sure all of you over here, must be aware of T-20 cricket. India is just like T-20 cricket – we may crumble, we may slog it out sometimes, but during the times when it matters the most i.e. the starting power-play overs and at the end, we make sure we surge ahead. And we do take strategic timeouts to regroup ourselves. No matter how badly India does, we will always have a set of cheerleaders rooting for us.

2. At a drivers association strike: India is like a taxi

India is like a taxi. Sometimes, the drivers may be good and secular, while at other times, they may be bad and communal. Sometimes, the driver can drive it too fast and crash, or the driver can be sleeping and thus, crash the vehicle. The fare keeps increasing every now and then. But it is still, the most preferred thing which foreigners prefer to ride on.

3. At an Amul anniversary function: India is like Blackcurrant ice cream

India is like Blackcurrant ice-cream. What makes it awesome are the yummy raisins that come along with the ice cream. Even though the raisins constitute a minuscule fraction of the overall offering, they are as essential to the overall awesome taste of the ice cream, as is the ice cream itself. So we have to make sure that there are ample raisins in every scoop we take in. There are some leaders who prefer the ice-cream without the raisins, perhaps, fearing that their teeth would get stained or whatever. We do not do that. We devour the ice-cream along with the raisins, no matter how cold it is.

4. At a Telecom investors meet: India is like an iPhone

India is like an iPhone. It even begins with an i. Nobody knows how useful it really is, nobody knows whether anything new actually happens each time, but its value only keeps increasing exponentially and there are millions of crazy folks who’re prepared to invest in it. That’s the power of India. If India is an iPhone, Congress is like Apple Maps, giving it direction.

5. At a fruit vendors welfare function: India is like a watermelon

India is like a watermelon. A hard exterior, but in the inside, a very soft, juicy and yummy fruit. Of course, there may be some black seeds here and there, but overall, it is the best fruit, especially in summer.

6. At a TED Talk: India is like a teddy bear

India is like a teddy bear. It may look cute or hostile, depending on how it is maintained, but on the inside, it is always full of soft cotton, sponge and wool. That’s the reason why many countries love to hug and cuddle India, except those that don’t believe in love at all.

7. At an advertising exhibition: India is like a Zoozoo

India is like a Zoozoo. It has enough animals to fit into not just one, but two zoos. Anyway, even when it has been stripped of all its wealth and accessories, it still looks adorable. Imagine how awesome it would look, if only we embellish every part of it with rich accessories.

8. At Mukesh Ambani’s Antilla: India is like an anthill

India is like an anthill. People may not notice it, people may inadvertently or intentionally stamp on it, thus destroying it temporarily. But the ants do not give up. They all unite, work together again and resurrect the anthill. Of course, the anthill is sure to curse and swear at whoever stamped it.

9. At an Indo-Korean friendship summit: India is like Gangnam style

India is like Gangnam style. No one has any clue what’s going on. Nobody understands a thing about what’s happening, but yet they chug along and when it comes to a sexy lady, everyone unites to admire her.

10. At a cricket commentary box: if India is a commentary box, then the Congress is its Ravi Shastri

A large number of people have begun staking humongous sums of money over when BJP PM candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi would be dragged into the imbroglio.

“The question is not whether he will be dragged in – no bookmaker is offering odds on that. Everyone believes that he will be. The logical progress of events suggest this – first the victim is maligned, then a BJP hand is claimed, and now Tejpal has even brought in the secular fabric of the nation into the equation. It is just a matter of a few days or hours even, before this whole thing is seen as a sinister, devious plan hatched by Narendra Modi,” said The UnReal Times‘ betting department chief enthusiast Haranath Padayappan.

“So the real betting topic is when Modi will be dragged in. Bookies are offering the best odds for 24 hours, followed by 48-96 hours, followed by much longer odds for 5 days or more. Bookies are also offering odds on the reason that would be cited to lay the blame on Modi. The most popular reason is that Modi has orchestrated this to divert attention from “Snoopgate”. A close second is a possible claim by Tejpal that he took the victim to the elevator, where there were no CCTV cameras, to protect her from pervasive snooping by Modi. Punters have already bet hundreds of crores of rupees,” said Padayappan’s deputy, Sindoo Kara Singh.

3363,0,"New York based CNN correspondent, Julia Whitehead, who was supposed to interview Pakistani cricketing legend turned politician, Imran Khan, ended up interviewing Bollywood actor Imran Khan instead under a case of mistaken identity. Julia had been recently assigned to the South Asian bureau and is working on an upcoming article on politicians from the sub-continent. Unfortunately, her knowledge of Bollywood, Cricket and South Asia in general is very sketchy, which led to her interviewing the wrong Khan. An Indian colleague had casually mentioned that Imran Khan was in New York shooting for a movie and the unsuspecting Julia promptly scheduled an interview with him before he left. Bollywood Actor, Imran Khan, in turn gladly agreed to the interview hoping it would fetch him some publicity and enhance his image with Indians living in America.

Here are excerpts from the faux interview that CNN kindly shared with The UnReal Times:

Julia: Thank you Mr. Khan for agreeing to the interview. Must say, you look quite young for your age. What is the secret of your youthful looks?

Imran (slightly taken aback): er… thanks. I work hard to pass off as a 22 year old although I am 28. Good sleeping habits, exercise and healthy diet do the trick for me.

Julia (giggling): Mr. Khan, your sense of humour is delectable… For a fast bowler, you have quite a small build and frame. How did you manage to be successful in your sporting career despite being so puny?

Imran (blushing): You yanks have a very weird sense of humour. Er… my cute looks and puny frame help bowl maidens over, you see. Hopefully, I will continue to maintain a good strike rate going forward also.

Julia (now laughing hysterically): I was told that Cricket is a sophisticated sport that we Americans will never be able to understand. I can see why now. On a serious note, how easy was it to make the transition to full time political activism?

Imran (raises his eye brows quizzically): er… I am not really a full time activist. I sometimes take a stand on issues of dubious public interest such as filing a PIL against increasing the legal age for drinking mainly to garner some publicity and increase my star value.

Julia: Wow, you advocate that drinking should be legalized? Mr. Khan, you realize that your life can be in danger for taking such a bold and extreme stand…

Imran: Hmm… now you are scaring me. Why would anyone want to kill me for taking such a stand? This is India for heaven’s sake, not Pakistan.

Julia (confused): er…but aren’t you a Pakistani?

Imran: Hell no!!

Julia: Huh? Wait a minute, aren’t you the famous cricketing legend Imran Khan who won the World Cup for Pakistan in 1992?

3364,0,"It was billed as an ideal final – a match between the two best teams in the competition. Many felt England, playing in home conditions, held the edge, and India would have to be at their best to put it past the Poms. The English were certainly charged up. If Dhoni was keyed up for the occasion, it didn’t quite show on his countenance in the pre-match photo-op with the trophy.

The rain gods have a very cruel sense of humour. First, they ensured the full quota of 100 overs in the India vs Sri Lanka semifinal, a match that fans wouldn’t have minded being washed out. And then, with no reserve day, they nearly washed out the entire day’s play of the finals. The rain would pause every now and then. And then, much like a Bollywood movie hits viewers with an item number just when people begin to think the story is getting somewhere, the rain would return, sending players, umpires and officials scurrying back to the pavilion.

Frustrated by rain interruptions, Cook enters Indian dressing room, falls to his knees & says, “Sir Jadeja, pls do something!” #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

After the nth rain interruption, the umpires declared a curtailed game – 24 overs a side – and then after yet another interruption, they whittled it down to a T20 match.

50 overs. Then 24. Now 20. At this rate, England will be declared the winner based on the toss that Alastair Cook won #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

Thankfully, the rain mostly stayed away for the rest of the day, and we had a match. And what a match it was! Riddled with a zillion twists and turns that would make Abbas-Mastan of Race fame proud!

It began calmly enough. Put in to bat, the Indian openers started cautiously before Rohit Sharma, showing extraordinary match awareness, re-calibrated his stay to fewer than 3 overs, and got bowled by Broad as he completely missed the line in going for an expansive drive. The stage had been set for the hitherto untested CSK Indian middle order to stamp its authority on the course of the game. But the rain gods, showing keen awareness of the IPL format, decided to impose a strategic time out:

No need to get too worked up about that rain interruption. Just think its a Strategic Timeout :P #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

And after the rain interruption, the first cruel twist unfolded: Between overs 8 and 12, the spine of the Indian batting, Dhoni, Raina and Dhawan, were dismissed by James Anderson Stuart Broad James Tredwell Ravi Bopara!! Perhaps he reminded the Indian batsmen of Ravi Shastri. Or maybe it was because he had gone unsold in this year’s IPL auction. Whatever. The Indian batsmen one by one committed hara-kiri in going after him and the Indian score read 66/5 off 13 overs.

Ravi Bopara – one export India hasn’t benefited from despite falling rupee #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

It was left to Kohli, ably assisted by Sir Jadeja, to repair the Indian innings and give the Indian bowlers something to defend. Some late order pyrotechnics ensured that India managed 129 in their quota of 20 overs. It felt like a below par score.

MSD: “129. Do we have enough?” | Sir Jadeja: “Relax, that’s 100 runs more than we need” #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

The Indian fight back began on the right note with Yadav quickly sending Cook back to the kitchen pavilion. The Indians smiled as Test specialist Jonathan Trott walked in. “Take your time with him, boys,” said Dhoni to his bowlers. Trott, however, had had something strange for lunch. He slammed Kumar for two boundaries to boost the English score, scoring at well over a run-a-ball. As the Indians wondered what the hell was happening, someone came up with a tactic:

It’s time Indians remind Trott of his South African roots, and remind him that this is a final #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

An adrenaline fueled Trott, perhaps unaware about Ashwin’s usual quota of wides, attempted to connect with an Ashwin delivery harmlessly floating down the leg side, overbalanced and was promptly stumped by the nimble Dhoni. The spin duo of Ashwin and Sir Jadeja then did what Indian bowling legends of yore have done over the nation’s illustrious cricketing history – strangulate the English batsmen and choke the flow of runs. Poor man’s Trott, Joe Root, departed, leaving Bell and Morgan at the crease.

And then came another ‘Ghanta’ moment for Bell, as he was given out stumped in a very iffy decision by the third umpire. Memories of the Bell incident from the third day of the Trent Bridge Test in the 2011 India-England series came flooding back:

Hope they don’t call Bell back by appealing to Dhoni’s sense of sportsmanship #RememberThatSeries #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

However, the third umpire had a perfectly sound explanation for his dubious decision:

Third umpire: “Actually I wasn’t looking at the bails. I was looking at Sir Jadeja’s reaction with awe” #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

With Ashwin and Sir Jadeja keeping things tight, Ishant played his role to perfection, leaking runs as easily as rivers overflowing their banks in U’khand. In hindsight, everything was going according to plan. Ravi Bopara and Morgan began to reconstruct the England innings, helped by some fine bowling by the lanky Indian pacer. At the end of 17 overs, 28 were needed off 18 balls with 6 wickets in hand. Ashwin and Jadeja would have to be saved for the final 2 overs which would coincide with the powerplay. Who would Dhoni deploy for the ante-penultimate over?

Ishant’s second ball was whacked for yet another six, followed by two wides. If Captain Cool was getting flustered, he wasn’t showing it at that moment. And then the miracle! Morgan and Bopara dismissed in what had really been part of an elaborate strategy! Sheer genius from Dhoni to have given the ball to Sharma. The icing on the cake was that the ball that dismissed Morgan was a classical slow ball, in the finest traditions of Indian slow bowling pioneered by the one and only Venkatesh Prasad.

2 overs left. 19 to get. England had one last hope, power-hitter Buttler. Cool as a cat, Dhoni tossed the ball to Sir Jadeja. Sir Jadeja ambled in and tossed it up on the middle stump. Buttler charged with the fury of a mad bull, swung his bat and connected big time.. with thin air. Bewildered he looked back only to find his middle stump pegged back.

What Sir Jadeja actually said with that wicket: “You better show respect to a knighted man, biatch!” #IndvsEng — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) June 23, 2013

Sir Jadeja scalped two wickets and gave away only four runs to put India firmly in the driver’s seat. 15 were needed off 6 deliveries, and Ashwin had the privilege of bowling the last over in a final of a world tournament, something traditionally reserved for men of steel like Joginder Sharma.

Stuart Broad, donning the senior’s mantle, demonstrated enormous maturity and leadership by taking a single and passing on the strike to the number 11 batsman James Tredwell. Tredwell did the best he could, which is another way of saying England fell short. India won by 5 runs, and viewers were treated to a rather unusual sight of Captain Cool jumping with joy.

Dhoni: The Manager. Does not come from a programming background. Came up the ranks from sustenance, support. Knows enough coding and has delivered successful projects. Used to specialize in delivering the project successfully literally minutes before the customer will start escalating. Handles external interfaces well by saying a lot without communicating much.

Seems to be losing the ability to finish the project on time. He was also strongly supported by the VP. Unfortunately, that VP has moved to international projects now and is also undergoing an investigation. He also has an ambitious assistant manager and the HR head seems to be against him as well.

Ravi Shastri: The head of HR. Has replaced the earlier HR head who was quieter and more amenable. Has been propping up the assistant manager, some feel, at the expense of the manager. Motivational talker. Has experience of being a manager in the past. Has been able to handle corporate politics well.

Virat Kohli: Assistant manager. Is a very good developer and was groomed to become manager. Has been managing company initiatives and other programs without the captain. Of late he is saying that he will deliver only for those projects where he is in control. This is in direct contrast to the times where he used to slog day and night and single-handedly deliver.

Rohit Sharma: Is the sales manager. Often gets started slowly. Just when you think he is not going to meet his numbers, brings in big orders and achieves his goals. No average performance from him. Either achieves 25% or 200%.

Rahane: Is a systematic, process oriented lead. Is very good for longer projects based on waterfall model. Still struggling to adapt to agile development. Catches bugs very well.

Raina: Very enthusiastic team player. Was a potential manager, but lost his way as he could not handle tough customers. He is still valuable under some conditions and is also a loyalist of the manager and the VP. How things go in the future, is anybody’s guess.

Ashwin: Is the financial controller. Has the knack of delivering profits even if the project was sold with single digit margins. Used to think of fancy investments in the past. Now has buckled down to focus just on the P&L and is doing a great job.

Umesh Yadav: Purchase Manager. He will get you things, but often will pay a lot more, putting more pressure on the financial controller.

Stuart Binny: Some say he is a better tester than a coder. Others say he is actually a better coder than a tester. He has delivered in neither. Also the son of one of the members of the board.",If the Indian ODI team were an IT company…,2696,2.596439169

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man.

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people.","UP govt’s ‘name and shame’ hoardings not backed by law, remarks SC at hearing challenging high court verdict",3165,1.327014218

With the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League just three weeks away, fans are eagerly awaiting the return of Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni. The former India skipper has been away from cricket since India’s exit from the World Cup last year after losing to New Zealand in the semifinal. The wicketkeeper-batsman is set to make a return for CSK in the IPL, and Dhoni has already started training at the nets at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

From the video, it remains unclear whether Dhoni is hitting the shots against a bowler or a ball-machine. But hitting five consecutive sixes, either ways, showcases that the cricketer is still capable of smashing big hits and light up Chepauk when the tournament starts on March 29.

Dhoni started his training in Chennai from March 2 along with other players ahead of season 13 of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 38-year old, whose future in the game has been a subject of intense speculation in the past few months, has maintained a stoic silence on what his next move would be. He was dropped from the BCCI’s list of centrally contracted players in January.

Four wins out of four paints a commanding picture, but, look closer at the performance of the Indian team at the ongoing ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, and what emerges are closely-fought games where a missed chance in the field could have been the difference between victory and defeat.

And these are chances that just a couple of years back the Indian team missed routinely; while Shafali Verma’s dazzling batting and Poonam Yadav’s mesmeric leg spin has drawn all the attention, it’s India’s drastically improved fielding that’s gone under the radar.

India’s wins en route to the final (on March 8, against Australia) have all come in relatively low scoring encounters—the rest of the batting line up have not kept up with Verma. It’s a combination of incisive bowling and sharp fielding that suffocated the opponents as they tried to chase—Australia faltered chasing 132 in the opening game, and New Zealand could not get to 133.

Even when India bowled first in their last league match, against Sri Lanka, it was the fielding which proved to be the difference. India pulled off some really good catches with Veda Krishnamurthy leading the way with two fine efforts in the deep to derail Sri Lanka’s middle-order and restrict them to 113.

In contrast, Sri Lanka dropped India’s top-scorer Verma twice.

“Their (India players) average height and limb length is much shorter than the players from teams like Australia, England and South Africa, but they are now negating their physical advantage with superior technique, the way we position ourselves and how we dive and slide,” says Biju George, who was the fielding coach of the women’s team from 2017 to November 2019, and largely credited for changing the fielding culture in the team.

“Most of all, it’s the attitude in the field. Our players are now ‘like we own the turf and you are not going to go past us’,” adds Biju, who is now the fielding coach for Sunrisers Hyderabad.

It’s not just that players from Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are taller or stronger, they also came through a far better system, with their training centres treating fitness protocols for men and women cricketers with equal emphasis.

To right these imbalances, coach WV Raman planned four camps since last June, with a focus on strength and speed work. The first camp was of 20 days, then two of 10 days each, and final one 10 days before the World Cup.

Earlier, says Biju, some of the women players’ throws from the boundary would not reach, but now some, like Deepti Sharma, throw as hard as anyone, including male players.

“Deepti is the best thrower in the world, I have coached some IPL teams and her throw is as hard as anybody,” he says. “You can’t take a second run on her throw.”

Agility too has improved by leaps—Jemimah Rodrigues and Smriti Mandhana have been especially impressive—their athleticism on the field a result of sprint training.

“Veda dives well and moves well,” Biju points out. “Jemimah is a livewire; she is very alert to the situation and quick in the field. She also has a very good throw. Mandhana covers so much distance, and I have never seen her drop a catch. Radhav Yadav tries very hard, is very versatile and can field at any position.”

But perhaps the best of the lot is 22-year-old Taniya Bhatia behind the stumps, a woman who, with six catches and three stumpings—the highest in the tournament—played a crucial role in India’s four wins.

“Taniya has quick hands, gathers well with soft palms and moves well,” Biju says. “She is good standing up to the spinners as well as pacers.”

There is another aspect to India’s fielding performance, and that’s the tactical acumen of their captain Harmanpreet Kaur.

“Harmanpreet’s field setting is brilliant. She gets the right player in the right position,” says Biju. “For example, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, who is a left-hander, is at backward point, and I saw her taking a good catch against Australia (opener Beth Mooney). Poonam Yadav is comparatively shorter, so she is positioned at short square-leg.

“India has the potential to be the best fielding side in the world”.

Biju, who knows the team as well as anyone, also feels that they will be unstoppable in the final.

“We are going to win this World Cup…100 per cent,” he says. “ Harmanpreet and Mandhana are due for a big scores and these two will get us through in the finals.”",India’s fielding takes a giant leap,4618,2.317020355

3371,0,"New Delhi: Several questions that have been dogging the minds of Indians for some time have been answered now. Why did Rahul Gandhi vanish? Where is he hiding? How to find him? Why did Congress lose Loksabha elections? And such.

A few days ago, BBC sent out a request to Rahul Gandhi for an interview. That is when Rahul went missing. Dreading the prospect of having to face an interview, he went underground, which has been described variously by the Congress leaders as vacation, winding down, soul searching, meditation, chilling, rejuvenating, brain(?)storming, strategizing, etc. But the fact has been established – Rahul is hiding from BBC. ‘Was hiding’, one should say, because BBC finally found him. One of the Indian journalists who was part of the BBC team related the story in depth, as below.

Two weeks ago, BBC approached Rahul Gandhi through his office, asking for an interview on important matters. The very term ‘important matters’ sent shivers down his spine and he declined to participate. However, BBC doggedly continued their pursuit. When they called him up directly on his personal number, he first did not pick up the calls. Then he said they had reached a wrong number. Then he said he was a different Rahul Gandhi. Then he spoke in a lady’s voice and told BBC that Rahul was out of office.

When he tried the same trick many times, BBC told him that they knew he was lying because they could see him in the office as they too were there. Rahul claimed to have forgotten where he was and told BBC he would meet them in a while. That was the last any one saw or heard of him.

Having waited in Rahul’s office for several days, BBC, in a desperate bid, took the help of a veteran Congress leader and one-man expert committee on Rahul Gandhi affairs, Shankar Iyer Mani (name changed to protect identity). They learnt that come what may, Rahul meets a childhood friend at least once a week, to exchange comics.

Having stayed put for about a week near the friend’s house, and disguised as comics sellers, they enticed Rahul to talk to them, with a promise to give him one more comic book than his friend would. Rahul liked the idea and started talking. But when BBC brought up the topic of interview, he got the jitters and tried to run away. But the lure of comics brought him back. And what transpired between BBC and Rahul is as follows.

BBC : Sir, we desperately want to interview you sir, please.

Rahul : But I have not applied for any job with BBC. So why do you want to?

BBC : Not a job interview sir, but…but…an interview…we ask you questions and you answer.

Rahul : What do you mean? Is this an exam or what?

BBC : No sir. It is not an exam. There won’t be a question paper and we don’t publish the result. It is oral. You just have to answer a few questions.

Rahul : How many?

BBC : Maybe about two dozen of them.

Rahul : No way. I have not answered more than five questions at a time ever, even in exams, out of the given twenty. So I will answer five.

BBC : Ok sir…. but please sir, we will cut it down to twenty.

Rahul : Six.

BBC : Fifteen.

Rahul : Eight.

BBC : Ten

Rahul : Done.

BBC : Sir, we will start recording now. Are you ready sir?

“YAY! 0 questions left”

Rahul : What do you mean? Why do you have to record it? Anyway one question down.

BBC : To show it on television sir.

Rahul : You mean I will be shown on TV?! Whoa!

BBC : Yes sir. Just like you came on TV some time ago, on Times Now.

Rahul : Oh No! No way am I going to do this interview. I am leaving.

(Saying this, Rahul bolted. BBC crew ran after him.)

BBC : Sir, Sir…it is not that. We are from BBC…not Times Now.

Rahul : Is Arnab Goswami around? Then I am going.

BBC : No sir. He is not there. He does not work for us. He does not work for anybody. In fact he does not work at all.

Rahul : You are right. He only plays games with people. But where is he?

BBC : Don’t worry sir, he is miles away. We won’t let him harm you. Can we start?

Rahul : Thanks. You can start. That was the second question. Eight left.

BBC : Why did you lose sir?

Rahul : Who said I lost? I always score the highest in all games. Ask my friends if you want. I am the top scorer in Temple Run. I have reached the highest level in Angry Birds. I scored a century in Book Cricket. I lose only in Tic-Tac-Toe.

BBC : Not that sir. Why did you lose in the Loksabha election?

Rahul : Oh! You mean the election. I did not lose. I won the election…..I think….that is what they told me. In fact Smriti Irani congratulated me. And so did many others.

BBC : Sorry sir, not you. Why did Congress lose the election?

Rahul : Oh okay…I too though about it. Quite a bit. I asked several people. And I found out the reason. It is because we did not get enough votes. Other candidates won. That is why we lost.

BBC : Then, why did you get lesser votes than others?

Rahul : It is my mistake. I lied to the people of India. I misled them. That is why they did not vote us.

BBC : Oh! So honest of you sir. What lie did you tell them?

Rahul : I kept telling them that there are six bills pending in the parliament, on important issues like women empowerment. In fact there were only four. That is the mistake I made. And the party had to pay for it.

BBC : But some say your family’s tight control on all affairs affected the party’s chances in the election. What do you think?

Rahul : That is not true. Ours is a great family. The Gandhi family. We all belong to the Gandhi family. Me, my sister, my mother, jijaji…all of us. Except our grandfather Jawaharlal. He was the only exception. I don’t know why he did not belong to our family. He belonged to the Nehru family. Our family is so great and so respected that Bapuji, the father of the nation himself adopted our family name and called himself Mohandas Gandhi. Anyway, you have two questions left.

BBC : Sir.but what about Robert Vadra that belongs to your family? Land deals.…?

Rahul : Sorry. I can’t answer that. Mummy has told me not to speak about jijaji, that too with strangers, even if they offer comic books. Last question!

BBC : Sir, some people say you are on vacation. When will you get back to work?

Rahul : Good question. Now that this interview is over, I have nothing to fear. I will immediately go back. Now, give me my comics.

BBC returned a happy team, for they could ultimately interview Rahul Gandhi. However, trouble started after that. After viewing the preview of the interview, and obviously embarrassed, the Congress said the interviewee was not Rahul at all. They accused BBC of using Rahul’s dummy in order to project Rahul as a dunce, at the behest of BJP, and demanded that the telecast of the interview be banned.

On the other hand, the Indian government felt the interview would show India and Indian politicians in poor light and sought to ban the telecast. BBC, first upset with a second ban on its program in just a couple of weeks, referred the matter to its own review committee. The committee was aghast at the content of the interview and readily supported the ban and decided not to air it in any part of the world.","BBC tracks down Rahul Gandhi for interview, India and BBC both ban the telecast",7110,3.88185654

The last time South Africa played a bilateral one day international series on Indian soil, they went on to win 3-2. It was the first and only series win for the Proteas in India. Apart from the batsmen from both sides, who made merry on flat tracks, the one bowler who stood out was the young Kagiso Rabada. Rabada and Dale Steyn picked up ten wickets a piece in the series but it was the youngster’s ability to keep a cool head in crunch situations that helped SA trump MS Dhoni’s team.

Five years later, another young South African paceman is looking to make his mark in Indian conditions. Lungi Ngidi played a decisive role in the Test series played between the two countries in early 2018. The youngster troubled Indian batsmen and helped South Africa clinch a closely fought series 2-1. He followed that up with 10 wickets in the ODI series against India but the team didn’t do well. Those performances came in helpful conditions and Ngidi had to prove himself further.

The young speedster was picked up by Chennai Super Kings and he produced the goods for the ‘Yellow Brigade’ in their comeback season in 2018. 11 wickets in 7 matches at a stunning economy of 6 helped Ngidi shine in a team full of seasoned superstars as CSK strolled their way to the title. The youngster though has struggled with injuries, which led to him to miss IPL 2019.

ALSO READ: Virat Kohli on verge of joining Sachin Tendulkar in ODI elite list

Ngidi though has made a good comeback and that has come at a time when South African cricket is going through a phase of transition. A poor outing at the 2019 ICC World Cup meant heads rolled and a new management is looking to take the team back to its glory days. The Proteas recently completed a 3-0 whitewash over Australia at home and Ngidi was at the centre of that success. With 27 wickets in 14 matches, Ngidi is South Africa’s most successful bowler in ODIs since 2019. His performance this year has been prolific, picking up 12 wickets in 4 matches.

The bounce he generates is disconcerting for batsmen and with the Indians still reeling from the impact of twin whitewashes in New Zealand, Ngidi could pose a potent threat. A look at the head to head records and Indian captain Virat Kohli holds an edge over the paceman in 50-over format. Ngidi though has dismissed the likes of Shikhar Dhawan in the past and definitely has the number of Shreyas Iyer.

One particular question on the merits of the Australian selectors’ decision to sack him was scythed to the extra covers with this answer “if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys”.

Unfortunately, his insinuation that the selectors may be simians has not gone down well with the chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, who is contemplating legal action. In Aussie culture, using the ‘monkey’ word is deemed racist – Bhajji learnt this the hard way during the 2008 Sydney Test when he was accused of calling Andrew Symonds ‘a monkey’. Bhajji claims to have called Symmo “teri maa ki” (“your mother’s”) which, strangely enough, is not that insulting in Aussie culture.

Kat [Simon Katich] may end up being sued by Hilditch, the Australian Chairman of selectors. “Hilditch would have taken it sportingly if Simon had labelled him with any other epithet – nincompoop, imbecile, jerk, even mother f***er, but using the ‘M’ word was just not on. We will take appropriate legal action against Simon now” said a Cricket Australia official. Simon when contacted reportedly said the ‘whole establishment is filled with apes’.

NDTV, living up to its reputation, came out strongly in support of the Congress. Its star anchor, Ravish Kumar, has produced a show where he displays a green screen (allegedly a secular connotation but read by BJP supporters as color of money), and tells its 450 viewers on how Sonia Gandhi has been made a victim of political vendetta.

In the recently concluded Indian elections, one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign themes was the need for India to move beyond dynastic politics. Families are present in all political parties in India, but in many, they are in control of the party. Equally, a majority of the top 500 companies in India are family businesses. But is the logic of family predominance in politics and business the same? If not what defines the difference?

Let us take politics first. Other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left parties, most political parties are “controlled” by families - the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena (SS), to name a few.

Max Weber had distinguished three types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority – charismatic, traditional and legal authority. He defined authority as power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. He averred that charismatic authority grew out of the personal charm or strength of the individual, people obeyed the leader because they believe in him or her. This authority sustains as long as people believe in the leader, and does not sustain post the death of the leader unless converted into the other forms mentioned – traditional or legal authority. Traditional authority emanates from tradition or custom - a monarchy, clan leader, dominant elite, chosen successor, or family eldest. Legal authority stems from the legal office that a leader holds, an authority that goes when the leader leaves office.

In this classification, parties like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BSP or are led by charismatic leaders and depend solely on them. This was also the case with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, under the late J Jayalalithaa. Parties that are family-led like the Congress, the SP, the DMK, and the SS are based on traditional authority and survive as long as the tradition stays strong, and the party leaders have enough patronage to dispense to their supporters. The reason family-led parties rarely convert to legal authority is because the family wants to stay in power, and is threatened by any institution that may challenge the family’s authority. They only allow a second line to develop from within the family, and trust only members of the family not to usurp their power. The moment the family members lose their charisma, or their ability to succeed and offer their retainers patronage, the party starts to weaken. It fails to rejuvenate unless transformed.

Finally, parties like the BJP and the Left ones are based on legal authority. Legal authority is more stable but needs to have a vision to offer its supporters. It needs to persuade people to believe in the underlying ideology that it espouses. If its ideology loses its appeal, or if its leaders do not ignite their supporters, then the party either adjusts its ideological moorings to the times or faces decline. The party leader enjoys authority only as long as they retain their office.

This defines the challenge for families in politics. The advantage of traditional power after the charismatic leader goes cannot sustain, unless either the children are charismatic, or subject themselves to legal authority where the hold of the family diminishes and then declines.

In contrast, the logic for family-run businesses is quite different. Once a business is established by the founder, the business becomes the wealth as well as occupation for the family. The wealth and prestige of the family is linked to the success of the business. The family does not need a mass following, only business acumen, to sustain and grow the business.

Each succeeding generation of the family has a choice that their counterparts in politics do not – they can manage their involvement in the family business differently. They can choose between being passive owners, activist investors sitting on the Board of their companies, or being active owner-managers. This is in stark contrast to politics, where family members are either completely in or out.

The dominant choice in India is for families to be owner-managers of their businesses.

There is a common belief that family businesses tend not to survive beyond the third generation. While there is some truth in this statement, it is a bit unfair because most non-family businesses also don’t survive beyond 60 years, and it is not that there are no family businesses that have survived beyond this time. Further the performance of owner-managed businesses compares quite favourably to non-family run businesses.

There are many methods to prepare the next generation in a family for business. It is easy to instil the values of the family in the next generation. They grow up in an environment where dinner conversations are about the business. They have a longer-term view about their business, and are more deeply committed to the business than other employees. They can be trained, mentored to understand their industry, taught about their sector and given lessons on how to manage employees. If they are open (and if the family desires), their performance “can” be measured objectively and feedback can be provided for development.

This is not to say that family businesses do not face their own challenges. Interests start to diverge among the children, and conflicts arise on account of wealth sharing, succession, and capital allocation. As families become larger and shareholding gets fragmented, decision rights and shareholdings start to diverge. Unless the family sets in place a family charter and a governance structure before the disputes begin, the challenge of keeping the family business intact become harder. Family businesses can survive and succeed overtime if the family leaders pay careful attention on how to manage the family with fairness, transparency, and by instilling a meritocratic value structure that distinguishes between management and ownership so that the business can be well-managed.

The political family in a democracy does not have the same advantage; charisma is not easy to pass on; and legal authority challenges the primacy of the family. Modi’s attack on undeserving dynasts amply demonstrated this in our election. In the end, the role and success of a family in business and politics is very different. Families should introspect and recognise that success is earned and not assumed.

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said.","YES Bank’s Rana Kapoor approved bad loans worth Rs 20,000 crore: ED",3622,2.236333517
3378,0,"Days after exit polls have predicted the complete rout of the Congress party, there is an intense leadership struggle in the Congress party. Much to the anguish of Sonia Gandhi, the electoral failure has led to a coup by young party leaders who have collectively accepted responsibility for mounting a leadership challenge. The undemocratic neo “syndicate” has demonstrated unprecedented resistance to the constitutionally ordained dynasts.

Rahul Gandhi has taken note of the developments and immediately left for London. Addressing the media in London, Rahul appealed to the British public’s deference to its dynasts, earnestly singing, “God save the queen from the toffee model.” His coach and sister, Priyanka Gandhi was also by his side. While Priyanka Gandhi did her bit to bolster Rahul’s credibility, she proved to be as much of a media distraction as Kate Middleton’s belly.

Like the British royals, Rahul is working tirelessly to establish his leadership credentials from his party war room in Buckingham. However the frequent comparisons to the British royals was strongly condemned by dynasty apologists who pointed out that while one prince worked hard for his country, the other played a largely ceremonial role as the Congress Vice president.

The Indian media in the meanwhile, belatedly woke up to Rahul’s frequent absences. Journalists justified their belated coverage by complaining that nobody notices when Rahul is missing and that it took them an entire election to notice it. “He lacks presence anyways,” commented another senior journalist. Rahul’s spokespersons justified his absence claiming that he had already sought permission from his mother to “work from home”.

The Indian media has also confirmed from their sources that the party coup was initiated by a wise and articulate 4 year old Londoner in an inconspicuous princess tea party. The toffee hog insisted that she was the only royalty in the party. The balloon deflator also kept talking about her imaginary stuffed-doll-family which the electorate could not see. This young party leader has declined to comment on Rahul’s leadership.

While the coup has excited many, satire writers at The UnReal Times are disheartened, “Rahul is a gift that keeps on giving. He won’t disappoint us even in opposition.”","After exit polls predict Congress rout, Rahul battles party coup in London",2292,1.483420593

The Scandinavian committee that decides the Nobel prize winners saw a lot of potential in the Haryana political biggies after exemplary remarks from the Khap Panchayat about lowering the marriageable age for girls to 16, and blaming the rising number of rapes squarely on TV and movies. But what sealed it was the outspoken Congress spokesperson, Dharambir Goyat’s comment which blamed 90% victims for approaching the sexual assault with consensus.

“Agencies world over have been trying to prevent rapes for a very long time now, but all they could think of were silly measures like strict punishment for the guilty, enforcement of better law and order, educating women about their safety et al. The root cause was totally ignored. Marry a girl off early, so she wouldn’t have an unsatisfied urge. What genius this!” lauded one of the committee members just after announcing the prize.

When this UnReal reporter questioned the winning ministers on the efficacy of the age bar, citing the rape of a 6 year old as an example, the minister quickly jumped on him with a detailed draft he had prepared. “You fools think we don’t know of that! The lowering of age to 16 is only the first step, we will continuously decrease it by steps of 5, and later make it mandatory for every girl to be married off when in her mother’s womb,” proudly proclaimed the minister.

The genius of the minister didn’t stop there, as he had other master ideas up his sleeves. “There have been a lot of complaints about gang rape as well in the recent past. The only logical solution to prevent it, as we see it, is polyandry. We have decided to legalize one woman getting married to multiple husbands. That way, any victim of gang rape would feel at home, and have due preparations to prevent any trauma,” he declared before adding a final punch, “The plan in the long run is to legalize rape itself, but we would need our people to be a little more mature for that.”

Former home minister, OP Chautala couldn’t help but stand up and applaud while vigorously nodding his head in approval, on hearing this mind boggling idea.

CHANDIGARH: At a time when Congress is striving to regain its lost ground in the state, former Haryana deputy chief minister Chander Mohan Bishnoi is also facing a 'now or never' like situation.Chander Mohan is locked in an electoral battle with Gian Chand Gupta, the chief whip and BJP candidate from Panchkula assembly seat. The constituency has got 2.8 lakh strong electorate. Chander Mohan's entry into the poll fray has made it tougher for BJP's Gian Chand Gupta who is seeking a re-election from Panchkula. The Congress leader is mainly banking on the contribution of his family as well as his late father and former CM Bhajan Lal for the growth of Panchkula that happened almost two decades back.On the other hand, Gupta is banking on the projects incepted over a period of the past five years. Besides, BJP is also hopeful of a positive result in view of the past Chander Mohan-Fiza controversy as well as factionalism in the Congress.In his mid-50s, Chander Mohan had made his debut in politics in 1993 when he fought a byelection from Kalka assembly constituency. The seat had got vacated following the death of Purush Bhan, the then MLA. Bhajan Lal was chief minister and he fielded Chander Mohan amid protests from Congressmen. ""Panchkula was the first such district of the country which had been carved out of a sub-division in 1995. That was the time when Panchkula was treated as a future capital and a roadmap to shift all headquarters was prepared. In fact, Bhajan Lal laid the foundation of modern Panchkula,"" said former MC president and Chander Mohan's confidante Ravinder Rawal. Rawal said Bhajan Lal and Chander Mohan were the architects of Panchkula and its growth so far. ""That (Fiza) episode was a bad phase of his life. But he did no wrong to anybody in the constituency. He remained accessible all the time,"" he said. Notably, Chander Mohan was last elected from Kalka in 2005 assembly elections. In 2009, he was denied a ticket and Devender Bansal was elected from Panchkula. But Bansal lost the seat to Gian Chand Gupta in 2014.Gupta and his team count construction of a ROB in Sector 19, house tax relaxation and Rs 2,000-crore development works during the BJP rule as their strength.""We have RTI queries of development between the Year 2004 to 2014. Panchkula was ranked second lowest when it came to development works in the state. They just laid the foundation stones and never bothered to take follow-up action,"" said former MC vice-president and Panchkula mandal president B B Singhal, who is also an election agent of Gupta.",Haryana assembly election 2019: Panchkula fight is wide open with Chander Mohan's entry,2761,2.281781963

Former India captain Jhulan Goswami is certainly disappointed with India’s World T20 final defeat in the hands of Australia but feels that this is not the right time to do a “post-mortem” of the abject surrender. The Meg Lanning-led side put up a dominant show to notch 184/4 and in reply, India meekly surrendered for 84 to miss a third world title in front of a capacity crowd of 86,174. “It’s very disappointing. But don’t forget that they made us proud in this World Cup. But it’s not the time to do a post-mortem. They would be very heartbroken and as Indians we need to stand by them now,” Jhulan told PTI on Sunday.

“I feel very proud for every player in the team. They have done extremely well and made India proud. Remember they had beaten Australia in the group stage,” the legendary pacer said. The 37-year-old Jhulan said that one important aspect that should be taken into account is the age factor.

“Please do remember that India had the youngest team in the World Cup in terms of average age. There were three players aged between 16 to 19 (19-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues, 16 year-olds Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh). They will learn a lot of things and they are the future of Indian cricket,” she said.

India were hugely let down big time by their skipper Harmanpreet, who had a forgettable tournament with 30 runs (2, 8, 1, 15 and 4) from five outings at an average of 6. “In such a tournament, every player has pressure. Maybe, she is going through an inconsistent phase. She didn’t get runs. People talk if you don’t get runs in a big tournament. But we all know what her calibre is. It’s not the right time to talk about her performance.”

Jhulan would rather like to harp on positives rather than picking on Harmanpreet. “It’s time to see how she led the team despite her poor run. She stood there for the players and fought well. She is obviously a good leader and has led the team from the front. They will definitely come out strong.”

India’s newest batting sensation Shafali Verma dropped a regulation catch off Healy, something that proved to be costly for India. “She’s just a 16-year-old girl, who made her debut six months ago and she’s now no 1 ranked player in ICC list. We must back her. And missing catches is a part of the game.”

Bengal youngster Richa Ghosh, who made her debut in the preceding Triseries final against Australia, played two matches in the T20 World Cup and made 18 in the final. “Richa looked very confident. She has a positive intent. I’m really happy for her,” Jhulan hailed. The speedster attributed Australia’s dominating show to their strong grassroots level cricket.

“Australia have much positive cricket. Obviously their grassroots level cricket much ahead of us. We are slowly getting there. These are all part of a learning process.” The final, which coincided with the International Women’s Day, also witnessed the highest attendance for a women’s sporting event in Australia. “It’s a huge achievement for women’s cricket. We must appreciate the Cricket Australia and International Cricket Council,” Jhulan hailed.","Not the time for post-mortem, they are all heroes: Jhulan Goswami",3123,2.529618956

The American Beauty star will play the role of Raman Bhalla, replacing Karan Patel, in the Ekta Kapoor soap.

Spacey has reportedly grown tired of playing a ruthless Congressman in the popular American political drama, House of Cards, and is craving for new creative challenges. The portrayal of the White House, especially its conduct of foreign policy, was anything but bullshit. But even that had lost its charm for a jaded Spacey. Playing the role of the world’s most powerful man felt clichéd, a case of ‘been there done that.’

And then, by sheer chance, Kevin caught an episode of ‘Ye Hai Mohabbatein’ and hasn’t stopped raving about it since. “The life of Raman Bhalla is more f***ed than that of the President of USA, man,” Spacey said. “I mean, the prospect of handling two ladies, Shagun and Ishima, must be tougher than dealing with China and Russia combined. On top of that add the joint families and their exes and those business rivals and corporate meetings and never ending series of festivals one after the other!!! A heady cocktail of melodrama, histrionics and action. No American TV series offers as much scope for drama and emotion. This is the role of a lifetime. Can’t wait to team up with Balaji for the role of a lifetime.”

Balaji Telefilms is ecstatic about the prospect of Spacey joining the cast. “To have a legend such as Kevin Spacey play the lead role in Ye Hai Mohabbatein is amazing. This is our version of Make in India. Our TRPs will soar high and viewership will double! We may even rename it Kyon Ki Kevin, Ye Hai Mohabbatein if things go well,” said producer Ekta Kapoor.

BENGALURU: Amid speculations of factionalism in ruling BJP after recent meeting of senior MLAs 'upset' over not being inducted into the BS Yediyurappa ministry, more such activities surfaced with another group discussing cabinet representation and a couple of legislators reportedly getting in touch with JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy Also, BJP legislators belonging to Panchamasali caste, a sect within the dominant Lingayat community, late on Tuesday held a meeting at a city hotel in the presence of a seer, and discussed about the representation of the community in the cabinet, party sources said.Several legislators are said to have attended the meeting in which they also discussed, among other things, about inclusion of Panchamasali community in the OBC list, and that a senior leader from the community should be made MLC.A couple of senior BJP legislators upset over not being inducted into the ministry are said to have reached out to Kumaraswamy on Tuesday night.Though JD(S) sources confirmed the MLAs contacting Kumaraswamy, it is not clear what transpired between them.The activities in the midst of the ongoing assembly session have raised eyebrows within the ruling BJP circles.Earlier, minister Jagadish Shettars meeting with senior legislators (mostly from north Karnataka ), reportedly upset over being left out in the recent cabinet expansion on Monday had sparked speculation of a revolt within the BJP.Dismissing the talk of dissidence, he, had maintained a few legislators met him regarding their constituency-related work.According to media reports, eight-time BJP MLA Umesh Katti, who is sore over not being made a minister, and Shankar Patil Munenakoppa were among those who had met Shettar 's at his residence.The development came even as an unsigned anonymous letter, calling for a change in the leadership citing Yediyurappa's age and health as the reason was widely circulated in the social media in the past few days.It called for Yediyurappa's retirement from electoral politics and suggests that he turn ""margdarshak"" (guide) for the party.Yeddyurappa will turn 77 on February 27.Amid all this, JD(S) patriarch HD Deve Gowda on Wednesday wished that the Yediyurappa government would complete its term, as it would provide him time to organise the party for the next assembly polls.My desire is that the Yediyurappa government should remain for about three years and a few months. I want time to build the party. I will never say this government has to go, because time is necessary. If the election happens in six month or one year, we will not be able to gain strength.

Kevin O’Brien hit a last-ball six as Ireland clinched a consolation super-over win against Afghanistan in the third Twenty20 international in India on Tuesday. With three runs needed for victory off the final ball of the super over, O’Brien cleared the long-off fence to end his team’s 12-match losing streak in T20s against the Afghans.

O’Brien made 26 off 21 balls in Ireland’s 142 for eight after electing to bat first.

Afghanistan, who won the series 2-1, replied with 142 for seven.

“Luckily that last hit came off,” a relieved O’Brien said after receiving the man of the match award.

“We have learnt from game one to game three, about specific plans for each player. You have to adjust quickly and I think we did.”

Afghanistan needed 16 to win off the final six deliveries of normal play, and paceman Craig Young claimed Asghar Afghan for 32 before Rashid hit a boundary off the last ball, taking the game into a deciding over.

Young then bowled a disciplined line and length to keep Afghanistan to just eight runs in six balls.

Gareth Delany also played a key part in Ireland’s win after top-scoring with 37 and then taking two wickets with his leg-spin.

Off-spinner Simi Singh hurt Afghanistan’s middle-order with two wickets off successive balls to send back Mohammad Nabi, for four, and Najibullah Zadran, for nought.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Rahmanullah Gurbaz top-scored with 42 and was named player of the series for amassing 105 runs in the three matches.

Bowlers Naveen-ul-Haq and Qais Ahmad took three wickets each in the Ireland innings.

“I think the wicket was good but our batsmen played some poor shots,” said Rashid.",Kevin O’Brien’s last-ball six helps Ireland clinch super-over win,1686,2.431791222
3388,0,"New York, USA. The movement to allow men to participate in beauty pageants received a deadly blow today when Miss Universe Organization outrightly rejected the demand citing cost-ineffectiveness of the idea. The organization believes that men are born ugly and it would amount to a huge waste of money and resources if they were allowed to participate in beauty contests. While the statement has shocked masculinists, the torchbearers of the movement have refused to lay down the fight for gender equality.

“We are not going to give up and bow down to such irrational statements. There has been a conspiracy to keep men under illusion that they were ugly and not suitable for beauty industry, and it’s a shame that the same is being propagated even today. But we will fight, and we’ll secure a world where men don’t feel ashamed to have luscious shining lips and a soft glowing skin.” leading masculinist and President of Adorably Soft and Sexy Men (ASS-Men) Farren Warrel declared.

Experts believe that one of them is a man

ASS-Men believe that there is no reason why the concept of beauty should be reserved only for women, when many men, who have been mocked as being effeminate and transgender, have successfully proved that men can be beautiful as well. ASS-Men believe that it’s high time men break away from these shackles and fight for their rights.

“When men wanted equality, they were told to participate in body-building contests with ludicrous titles like Mr. India and Mr. Universe. The winners are neither taken on a world tour nor are they asked to pose nude for hungry children of Africa. What a sham! It was a conspiracy to convince men that they were good only at physical strength and not physical and inner beauty. This is such a narrow and disgusting thought.” Farren Warrel said.

But it seems the organizers of beauty contests are not at all impressed with such arguments.

“Men are hopelessly ugly. We would need to spend crores on each one of them to make them appear even remotely as beautiful as a common woman on the street. And once they start looking beautiful, the poor man is taken away for some movie or television program. It is not fruitful for either party (beauty contests organizers as well as male participants).” President of Miss Universe Organization Paula Shugart said.

Paula further argued that men, who think they were beautiful, should try beauty contests for transgenders and transvestites and not try to break into mainstream beauty contests. But protestors believe that the statement was aimed at dividing them.

“I think Rohit Verma, who is a man, is any day more beautiful than Rakhi Sawant, who is a woman. Can anyone contest that? I challenge you to run an online poll and Rohit will beat Rakhi hands down. Why should then men be kept away from beauty contests?” Bobby Darling, the national transgender of India, supported ASS-Men’s demands.","""Rampant ugliness makes men cost-inefficient for beauty contests""",2899,1.96619524

DMK president MK Stalin on Tuesday rubbished the claims of Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan who claimed that the Dravidian major was in talks with the saffron party and said he would quit politics if proved otherwise.

“If Tamilisai Soundarrajan or Narendra Modi, whom she wants to become Prime Minister again prove that I am talking to them for an alliance with the BJP, I’m prepared to quit politics. If they fail to prove it, will they renounce politics?” the DMK president challenged in a hard hitting statement to the media.

“It is unfortunate and painful that Tamilisai, hailing from a family with a political legacy, has denigrated herself to this level and allowed to be a scapegoat by the self seeking BJP leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others. This is part of the dirty tricks of the BJP,” the statement read.

“I was the first to endorse Congress President Rahul Gandhi for Prime Ministership and rip apart Modi as a ‘fascist, sadist and autocrat’ throughout the poll campaign to prevent by all means his return to power,” Stalin said.

He suspects this was a ploy by the BJP to prevent the votes of the minorities for the DMK in the crucial bypoll to the four assembly segments on May 19 and to blunt the DMK’s campaign projecting Rahul for PM. “For no reason, they are trying to drag the DMK,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Tamilisai Soundarrajan dropped a bombshell claiming that the DMK was in talks with the BJP.

“The hunger and thirst for office is driving Stalin to reach out to Modi. First, it was Rahul, then KCR and now it is Modi. Everyone knows the DMK changes colours. To each one, he is showing a different colour. They are speaking through someone and are establishing connection,” she said and laughed heartily at the media interaction in Thoothukudi.

“It is true,” she affirmed when asked whether the DMK was in touch with the BJP for a post-poll tie-up. However, she did not elaborate.

“Post-KCR meeting, why Stalin was not firm in endorsing Rahul Gandhi for Prime Ministership?” Soundarrajan asked.

Also read: Did Stalin snub KCR’s Federal Front pitch? Just a ‘courtesy call’, says DMK

She claimed that the BJP would retain power at the Centre on its own and that the saffron party is not worried over the Stalin-KCR meeting. “Emergence of any number of fronts would only benefit the BJP,” she asserted.

Soundarrajan who is the BJP candidate from the southern coastal constituency of Thoothukudi is up against the DMK’s Kanimozhi.

The Congress has dismissed Soundarrajan’s claim as an ‘unadulterated lie’ which is proof of the BJP being rattled at the electoral rout.

“There is not even an iota of truth in Tamilisai’s unfounded claim. The DMK is firmly with the Congress and we have no doubt about it. This betrays the saffron party’s mortal fear of facing the prospect of a rout in the LS poll. Hence, it is attempting to sow the seeds of confusion in the opposition camp. Such dirty tricks would not succeed as Stalin is committed to secularism and pluralism,” TNCC president KS Alagiri told the media.

But the AIADMK latched on to Soundarrajan’s claim to target the DMK. It said there was nothing surprising in the DMK talking to KCR and the saffron party, even while remaining in the alliance with the Congress. AIADMK veteran and Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister Jayakumar led the charge against the DMK on Monday claiming that the Dravidian major was reaching out to the BJP with a bargain for five plum ministerial berths at the Centre. He reiterated it on Tuesday as well.

“Only Stalin is capable of sailing in three boats at the same time. While being in alliance with the Congress, he is hosting Chandrasekhar Rao and holding parleys with the BJP. It has become crystal clear to Stalin that the the election results will be in favour of the AIADMK in the state and the BJP at the Centre. Hence, he is in talks with the BJP to secure five ministerial berths at the Centre,” Jayakumar told the media.","‘Ready to quit politics if proved DMK in talks with BJP’, says Stalin",4032,1.810515873
3390,0,"Inspired by the full-page ads released by Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi’s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal highlighting his government’s achievements, an Aam Aadmi of Delhi has spent a fortune publishing full page ads in country’s leading newspapers to influence the opinion of his wife about him.

Rajat Sharma, a resident of Dwarka in Delhi, got full page advertisements published in the Delhi editions of half a dozen leading newspapers on successive days from Monday through Wednesday. The ads, running over multiple pages, highlighted Rajat’s contribution and achievements during the past one year of his married life.

It is learnt that Rajat and Rita had a love marriage last year, but rifts began to emerge in their married life, with Rita complaining that Rajat had failed to fulfil the promises he had made before marriage. When all efforts from Rajat to convince Rita about his love and commitment towards her failed, he decided to follow in Kejriwal’s steps and draw his wife’s attention through newspaper advertisements.

In the first advertisement placed on Monday, Rajat showcased the good life he has been giving to his wife over the past one year, the number of times he has taken her out for dinner and movies, the number of presents he has brought for her, including the diamond earrings he gifted her recently, the number of designer clothes he has purchased for her, and the vacations, including a foreign one they have taken together. The ad also mentions the amount spent under each head, the biggest being Rs. 5 lakhs for the diamond earrings gifted on their first wedding anniversary.

The next page of the advertisement highlighted Rajat’s contribution towards the improvement of the transportation system of his family. The ad displayed a photo of a brand new car that he had gifted to his wife making her commute for work and shopping easier and safer.

In the ad published on Tuesday, Rajat spoke about how he has improved the sanitation and health condition of his home by volunteering to vacuum the floor and mop the windowpanes once a week, something which he had never done as a bachelor.

In the ads published on Wednesday, Rajat showcased his sensitivity towards the women of the house i.e. his wife, by claiming that he volunteers to do dishes after dinner every night, changes nappies of their 3 month old baby, and cares for the crying infant through the night, allowing his wife to sleep uninterrupted.

These ads are likely to continue for a couple of days more.

Meanwhile, it is learned that Rajat’s wife is not impressed with the ads and plans to place her own ads in newspapers refuting Rajat’s claims by arguing that he has done nothing to curb pollution at their home, especially the noise-pollution created by his snoring at night, and has also failed to allocate a sufficient budget for her shopping requirements.","Inspired by Kejriwal, man gets full page ads published in newspaper to impress his wife",2855,1.541155867

The much-loved party chief had tweeted his indignation in the morning and the party called an emergency (read how-to-stay-relevant) strategy meet to discuss the dharna politics played by the other parties.

The party unanimously decided that it was time to take a strong stand against dharna-based underhand politics. Senior party leader Ashish Khetan confirmed to the media that his party is planning to hold a dharna spearheaded by Kejriwal.

Ashutosh slammed both the fascist BJP and the Congress for their bankruptcy of ideas.

3395,0,"Srinagar. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has made a sensational revelation that removing Article 370 might cause sudden movement of tectonic plates in the region resulting into separation of Kashmir from India.

As per Omar, this was a hidden secret, but the intentions of the NDA government led by BJP compelled him to make it public.

Holy warrior

“We first came to know about this prophecy after one of my forefathers found a secret quote written on a piece of stone in a remote area of Kashmir, which read, ‘Three seventus removam, dhartis fatam, Kashmirus separatum‘. Back then, 370 was not even in existence,” claimed Omar Abdullah while addressing a press conference.

Omar further revealed that the stone had been with his family for centuries. His forefathers showed it to many alchemists, astrologers, and jewelers alike, but none of them could find anything special about the stone.

“But we knew that we were not holding on to something ordinary and worthless,” the Chief Minister of Jammu & Kashmir said, “Once India got independence and Pakistan invaded Kashmir, we realized how precious our possession was.”

Omar claimed that once Article 370 was introduced in the constitution of India, the prophecy written on the stone became clear, and at the same time it became clear that Omar’s family was the chosen one to protect this article and the stone.

The young Abdullah also claimed that a mysterious mark had automatically appeared on the left arm of his forefather who found the secret stone. He claimed that this mark was being passed from generation to generation. Omar even rolled up his sleeve and showed the special mark to prove that he was one of the secret protector of Article 370.

While many appear convinced with Omar’s assertion, others have failed to understand how could removing a man made constitutional provision could possibly alter natural terrain.

“Some things are beyond human understanding, just like Article 370. So better not to talk about them, otherwise who knows, Kashmir might get separated not only from India, but from the whole world.

3397,0,"It was billed as a match between the most powerful batting line up and the strongest bowling side. With the Sun Risers having won every one of their previous home matches in Hyderabad, it wasn’t expected to be too easy for CSK to trod over Sun Risers.

Going by the tournament stats in the games leading upto the match – the highest score by a team in Hyderabad was 130 – the pitch seemed to complement the potent Sun Risers bowling line up lead by the intimidating Dale Steyn. Dhoni, as always, made his own assessments

Sun Risers skipper, Kumar Sangakkara, led from the front by boldly facing up to MS Dhoni for the toss, and exceeded expectations by actually winning it. His momentary sense of satisfaction as he put the Super Kings in to bat, evaporated after Dhoni casually remarked that he had intended to do the same.

Without much ado, the game was underway, even as some in the Sun Risers camp wrestled with their loyalties…

A popular magic trick young fathers in Chennai show their little kids is to point at Murali Vijay in the middle, ask their kids to make a rapid 360 degree turn and watch in amusement as their little jaws drop in awe when they find Suresh Raina standing in place of Vijay. Wednesday, it seemed, wasn’t a good time for this trick, as Murali Vijay continued to survive well into the 2nd over. And when Vijay slammed Ishant Sharma for three consecutive sixes a couple of overs later, it wasn’t the kids, but the adults who watched with their jaws somewhere near their knees.

Dhoni: “I did say the team is getting complacent, but not in my wildest dreams did I expect Murali Vijay to respond” #CSKvsSRH — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) May 8, 2013

Murali Vijay eventually stepped out of the present, and for a brief second paused to look back upon what he’d done over the last few overs. Shocked by what he found, Vijay lost his focus, and departed to the first short ball that came his way. Suresh Raina swaggered in.

Hope CSK recovers from that Murali Vijay onslaught in time to be able to build on the foundation #CSKvsSRH — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) May 8, 2013

There is really no other way to describe the next ten overs other than saying that it was calculated devastation. Sun Risers bowlers had to frequently visualize Gayle striking a 30 ball 100 against the Pune Warriors to rescue themselves from plummeting into the dark depths of depression.

The run making spree ended on a cataclysmic note, when Suresh Raina took Ishant Sharma for 25 runs, repeatedly hitting him to the extra cover boundary in a scene that, with a bit of pixelation and better commentary, could very well be mistaken for a casual session of Brian Lara’s cricket.

Dhoni ambled in, but his reputation had sprinted in before him, and Perera promptly bowled three consecutive full tosses to him. Captain Cool responded with three attractive agricultural hoicks, survived the first two and holed out in the 3rd. After that, the batting worm took its usual upward curve with the only event worth recording being Sir Ravindra Jadeja denting Dale Steyn’s figures with a couple of classy strokes.

Steyn may be the best fast bowler in the world, but even he has to bow before Sir Ravindra Jadeja #CSKvsSRH — The UnReal Times (@TheUnRealTimes) May 8, 2013

The scoreboard read 223/3. CSK batsmen swaggered back to their dugout to high-five their coach Fleming, while Ishant Sharma gave a wide berth to his bowling coach Waqar Younis and turned on his Facebook account only to find a few new fans.

The Sun Risers innings was nothing to write home about. Apart from a useless little cameo by Parthiv Patel, an attempted rearguard effort from poor man’s David Miller, Thisara Perara, and a neat 39 from Karan Sharma that served no purpose other than making up the ‘positives’ that losing captains so desperately look for, the Sun Risers innings floundered and ended abruptly at 146.

Suresh Koth, 50, has entered electoral politics after remaining active in farmer agitations, including the Jat reservation stir, for years.

Koth is the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate from Lok Sabha seat of Hisar.

He is pitted against Dushyant Chautala of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which is contesting the polls in alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP); Congress candidate Bhavya Bishnoi, son of senior party leader Kuldeep Bishnoi; and BJP nominee Brijendra Singh, former bureaucrat and son of Union steel minister Birender Singh. Koth had actively participated in the quota agitation right from the time it was launched in Haryana in 2010. He is facing many criminal cases for blocking national highways, rioting and unlawful assembly at various police stations of Hisar.

All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) state spokesperson Rambhagat Malik said Koth shared stage with senior Jat leaders during 2010 protests for reservation for the community.

Koth, a resident of Koth Kalan village, completed his BA degree from Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi, in 2018.

Claiming that he is a common man, Koth says, “INLD is the only party that has given tickets to common people. It’s only the people like us who actually know the issues of the common man.”

He added, “Being a farmer leader, I know the problems and issues of the peasantry and how to get these resolved.”

Koth said he has already started his election campaign and is getting support from all sections of society.Asked about his contest with heavyweights of other parties, he said, “Heavyweight leaders from other parties will come here to seek votes and they will not show their face again for five years. However, I am going to stay here forever.”",Lok Sabha elections 2019: From Jat quota stir to electoral politics,1793,2.509760178

RANCHI: The Jharkhand results on Monday delivered a morale-boosting victory for the opposition with the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance winning a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81, and another state slipping out of BJP’s hands after its big sweep in the Lok Sabha elections that returned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a record second term. Hemant Soren of JMM is set to take over as chief minister, returning to the job he held for a year before BJP won in 2015. The oath ceremony will take place on Thursday.BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014, its decision to contest alone after failed negotiations with regional ally AJSU Party backfiring and the party ceding the status of “single-largest party” for the first time. The contrast to the sweep in the LS elections — BJP won 11 and AJSU one of Jharkhand’s 14 seats — a little over six months ago was astonishing.Till late in the evening, the JMM-led alliance had 47 out of 81 seats. While JMM had 30 seats, Congress had 16 and RJD one. JMM and Congress posted their best-ever shows. Soren, the working president of JMM, won from Dumka and Barhait seats in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana.The saffron loss seems to be the fallout of several factors. The break with AJSU Party may have proved critical as the vote share of the two parties — BJP (33%) and AJSU (8%) — suggests that they could have made a fight of it if the alliance had held. Incumbency woes returned to haunt BJP with chief minister Raghubar Das losing his own Jamshedpur East seat to BJP rebel Saryu Roy by a margin of over 15,000 votes.The nullification of Article 370 , the Ayodhya verdict and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act could not give BJP an edge. Besides Das, BJP state president Laxman Gilua too lost his seat. If the CM suffered from an image problem, his upper hand in government and party also had a negative fallout. The sidelining of rivals led to a dependence on Das and though BJP did not totally lose the development narrative, the lack of a regional ally and the coalescing of tribal sentiment behind the JMM-led alliance proved too strong to overcome.Coming on the heels of the unexpected post-poll loss in Maharashtra, the Jharkhand result means that BJP is out of office in another important state.After its Lok Sabha win, BJP has found the going tough in elections in states where it has been the incumbent, holding on to power in Haryana with the help of Dushyant Chautala’s JJP. In Maharashtra, BJP underperformed in terms of exit poll projections even though it won comfortably in alliance with the Shiv Sena only to face the desertion of its saffron twin.The seeming alienation of the tribal vote, accentuated by the split with the OBC-driven AJSU Party, appears to be a fallout of the misfired attempt to amend the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act. While the intent was to give tribals greater say in disposal of their lands, it was read as an anti-tribal move. JMM and Congress shrewdly exploited this perception and turned a key voter segment towards them.The Jharkhand result saw the opposition claim that BJP’s decision to raise “divisive” issues like CAA and a nationwide NRC has backfired. How such issues can play out in a national election cannot be easily determined, but in the immediate context, they failed to make up for incumbency and a ruptured alliance. BJP’s failure has provided an opportunity for Congress and other opposition parties to argue that there is a space for an anti-BJP narrative and smart alliances can work.Congress functionaries said issues of jobs, food security, agrarian crisis, among others, worked with voters. Congress in-charge RPN Singh said, “The verdict is also a referendum against BJP’s CAA-NRC, Ram temple, Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir versus jal, jungle, zameen in Jharkhand.”For the opposition, the key was the smooth manner in which seat-sharing was arrived at with Congress willingly accepting the junior partner’s slot. After some bargaining, Congress also agreed on projecting Hemant Soren as the alliance’s CM face. The alliance that had done so poorly in the Lok Sabha elections — even JMM’s pater familias Shibu Soren lost — bounced back with surprising vigour, taking on BJP and its heavyweight campaigners, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.While BJP’s use of “national issues”, articulated by Modi and Shah, has been questioned in the light of the results, there is a school of thought in the party that its numbers might have dipped even more if the party had gone local.In Video: We will work for the people of Jharkhand: Hemant Soren",Jharkhand election results: Another state slips out of BJP's control,5045,1.942517344

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the rupee face a similar predicament -- old foes have re-emerged to keep them in check.

Brent crude rose above $80 a barrel last week for the first time since 2014, and is looking ominous for the nation’s budget deficit, inflation and the currency. Meanwhile, Modi faces the prospect of rival parties uniting to block his re-election bid after their success at a recent state poll.

Together, elevated oil prices and political uncertainty have sent the rupee 3% below the year-end analyst consensus targets, and some strategists expect the currency to weaken past a 2016 record low of 68.8650 per dollar. The combination couldn’t have come at a worse time, with rising Treasury yields spurring a selldown of emerging markets.

“Bouncing oil prices will add to India’s inflation woes and intensify market concern over the nation’s trade and current-account deficits,” said Qi Gao, a Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. He expects the currency to head toward 69 per dollar. The forecast is in the ballpark of the 69.63-to-70 range priced in by the onshore and offshore forwards markets.

Every $10 rise in the oil price worsens India’s current-account balance by 0.4% of GDP, pushes up inflation by 30-40 basis points, and hurts growth by about 15 basis points, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.

The currency rose 15 paise against the US dollar to 67.97, paring some losses. The consensus forecast is for the rupee to trade at 66 by the fourth quarter, and even the most bearish of analysts like Westpac Banking Corp. had only seen the rupee at 68.5, the estimates show.

FX intervention

Further weakness in the currency could hurt capital inflows and pressure the current account deficit, said Aditya Pugalia, Dubai-based director of financial markets at Emirates NBD PJSC. Global funds have pulled $3.5 billion from Indian bonds so far this year, while flows into equities have shrunk to under $600 million after withdrawals of $1.6 billion since April 1.

The Reserve Bank of India probably burned through $8.4 billion of reserves in the four weeks through May 11 to halt the drop, data from the central bank show. Investors should expect more measures, including monetary tightening, according to RBC Capital Markets LLC.

“All tools are on the table, including regular FX intervention, other market operations and monetary policy,” said Sue Trinh, a strategist at RBC Capital in Hong Kong. She expects the rupee to trade at 65.20 to a dollar by the year-end.

The uncertainty spurred by an election-heavy year is also taking a toll. The outcome of this month’s poll in Karnataka, where the BJP was outsmarted by an opposition alliance despite securing the most seats, raised the prospect of rivals uniting to keep the ruling party out at the national ballot in 2019.

“While we do not expect a 2013-style panic (taper tantrum), the rupee performance could be constrained by concerns over increased fiscal spending ahead of state elections,” Nomura analysts including Craig Chan wrote, noting that the next key state elections aren’t due until late in 2018.",Oil conspires with politics to drive rupee toward record low,3144,2.767175573

MUMBAI: Amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has said there are no detention centres in the state and Muslim citizens need not worry under his regime.He gave the assurance to a delegation led by some MLAs from the Muslim community who called on him on Monday.Talking to PTI, NCP MLA Nawab Malik, who was part of the delegation, said the chief minister assured that Muslims will not face any injustice in the state.The chief minister assuaged concerns of the community, saying the detention centre at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai was meant for foreign nationals involved in drug peddling cases, said Malik, whose party is an ally of the Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.Only 38 people can be kept there (Kharghar detention centre). It is meant for foreign nationals following their release from jail, before they can be extradited to their country of origin, Malik said quoting the chief minister.""People should not have any misunderstanding about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. My government will not allow rights of citizens from any religion or community to be hurt. I appeal for peace and harmony in the state,"" the NCP leader said quoting the CM.Maharashtra Home Minister Eknath Shinde , Industries Minister Subhash Desai , Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal, Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve, Shiv Sena MLA Abdul Sattar and Congress MLA Amin Patel were also present on the occasion.During a rally in New Delhi on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress, its allies and ""urban Naxals"" of spreading the rumour that Muslims will be sent to detention centres.""The citizenship law or the NRC have nothing to do with Indian Muslims. They have nothing to worry,"" Modi said at the rally.Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said his government had put up a proposal to set up a facility for temporary keeping of foreign nationals whose visas have expired.""Yes. Cidco (City and Industrial Development Corporation) was asked to provide a land (in Navi Mumbai) to set up a centre for those foreigners who are found living in India beyond the visa expiry period.

“Doston, there is a change in plans. It will be an Arvind vs Satish, not Arvind vs Mukhi fight for becoming the CM of Delhi,” Kejriwal said at a hurriedly convened press conference. When asked whether he no longer considers Mukhi a giant worthy enough to be slayed, Kejriwal shot back, “I consider Satishji to be as corrupt as Jagdishji. Sab mile hue hain, ji [They are feathers of the same flock]. However, it is the AAP’s prerogative to choose its principal opponent and the party now wants me to fight against Satishji and not Mukhiji.

But AAP will not sit and watch. AAP will convince people that it is a choice between Arvind and Satish Upadhyay. Depending on the funding situation, we will print posters of Satish ji as the Delhi BJP candidate so that he can be exposed as the BJP’s Delhi CM candidate,” Sisodiya explained to reporters.

Kejriwal also said he will no longer press for Shazia’s return to the AAP fold. “She will be much more useful to us by working with the BJP and organizing functions at the India Islamic Centre,” the former Delhi CM said, smiling impishly.",Arvind Kejriwal now declares Satish Upadhyay as BJP’s Delhi CM candidate,1795,1.782729805

PNG had been accorded ODI status after finishing fourth in the World Cup qualifiers held in New Zealand in January 2014.

The ICC has reacted favorably with ICC chairman N Srinivasan observing: “The ICC is committed to expanding cricket into other corners of the world, paa. We are very impressed with the way the PNG cricket has improved by leaps and bounds. Plus, the fact that they finished 4th in the recently held World Cup Qualifiers is a testimony to the immense potential of the team.”

N Srinivasan also expressed a desire to see India playing Tests in PNG later this year. Rumour mills are abuzz that India’s proposed tour in the latter half of 2014 to Australia will be cancelled and India will play five Tests, four ODIs and one T-20 against the Papua and New Gunieans instead.

Touring PNG, Indian cricket fans reckon, will be beneficial to Indian cricket in many ways:

1) A series victory over PNG will rejuvenate the players and restore much needed self- confidence in them just like the ODI against Bermuda did after the shock defeat against Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup.

2) Since PNG is located in the southern hemisphere just north of Australia, this will technically count as a tour Down Under. India has never won a series in this part of the world. So this is a great opportunity to set the record straight.

3) Papua New Guinea holds the record for the highest score by any team in ODIs. Defeating such a mighty team will silence all critics.

4) The PNG team is made up of Anglo-Saxon cricketers, descendants of Englishmen and Australians. As we seem to be unable to beat the English, we can beat the pseudo English and take revenge. Indeed, defeating PNG will be akin to defeating a combination of England and Australia, thereby obviating the need for touring these countries and getting humiliated. Instead, we could arrange for a home series with Bangladesh, West Indies and Zimbabwe and wrap up the Tests in under two days.

The election of nine women legislators in the 90-member Haryana assembly, and 23 in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, shows very clearly how women’s representation remains a low priority for all political parties. In 2014, the figures were 13 and 20 respectively. This is so, despite the fact that there has been a steady increase in women voters in both the state and general elections — a process which should have had a positive effect on their entry into the electoral fray. In Haryana, where the Manohar Lal Khattar government has been aggressively trying to correct gender inequalities with schemes like the Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao, 32 constituencies did not field any woman at all. In fact, while parties did speak about women’s issues sporadically, there was little engagement with the question of their participation in the political system. Were it not for women from political dynasties, the number of women would be even less.

One reason social scientists ascribe to women staying away from contesting elections is the slander and abuse they face during campaigns and their lack of clout and money power. The other reason cited is lack of safety. But the argument often put forward by parties is that women lack the winnability factor. This is not true. Official data from the Election Commission collated since 1998 shows that the success rate of women and men candidates does not differ, and, in fact, women have the slight edge, all things being equal. The dismal number of women who got tickets, and who finally won in these elections, suggests that there is no inclination among political parties to bring in more women candidates. The poor figures mean that they have not been able to influence decision-making within parties despite there being powerful women leaders in many of them.

Women do not vote in homogenous blocs, and, therefore, they are seen as not powerful enough to influence outcomes. However, this may be slowly changing with the emergence of what parties see as the “woman vote”. The challenge remains equitable power-sharing. When women have got power, thanks largely to reservations, at the panchayat level, they tend to focus on crucial issues like education, health and nutrition. The problem they face is that, despite doing well at that level, they are largely ignored in the power structure at higher levels. Women are making their mark in several fields, from sports to astrophysics. It is a pity that politics is not keeping pace with society.",Women’s representation is dismal.

NEW DELHI: On a day Congress attacked BJP for pledging to bestow the country's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , the saffron party came out strongly in favour of its poll promise made in Maharashtra and said Congress leaders were ""ignorant"" of their own party senior's views.Union minister Jitendra Singh tweeted a letter written by the late Indira Gandhi in 1980 in which she called Savarkar a ""remarkable son of India"" and extended her full support to plans to celebrate his birth centenary year.""I have received your letter of 8th May 1980. Veer Savarkar's daring defiance of the British government has its own important place in the annals of our freedom movement.

He was in jail for 12 years-Besides, he had formed a union of prisoners against the British,"" Singh told TOI.In its manifesto for the Maharashtra assembly elections, BJP has promised to propose the names of Savarkar, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule and Annabhau Sathe for Bharat Ratna.

Singh has received an email from Hollywood director James Wan, requesting permission to film the third installment of his spine-chilling “Conjuring” series in the state.

In an exclusive interview to The UnReal Times, Wan said that this wasn’t the first time he had heard about Madhya Pradesh. “I’ve been following the news in MP right from the time these Vyapam scam deaths started happening. It was so fascinating, I’ve hardly ever seen something this mysterious happening in real life. But when this Bhupendra chap mentioned that farmers were dead because evil spirits had possessed them, that really hooked me on to it. I told Peter (Safran) that we’ve absolutely got to film Conjuring 3 there and after he read the news, there was no way he couldn’t agree,” a thrilled Wan exclaimed.

While rival parties have, in a rare moment of bonhomie, welcomed Wan and his team to the state with open arms, they also had a word of caution for him. Leading the charge in responding was former MP Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh. “It is heartening to know that the team behind the world’s best horror movie series finds the heartland of India very attractive and appealing. But at the same time, I’d like to warn them that the RSS, which is based here, is without doubt, a horror bigger than anything else they would have ever seen in their lives and scarier than anything they would’ve ever imagined. So I would like to advise them to be careful while dealing with the Sangh – so Wan and Safran, please beware of the saffron!” the Congress general secretary smiled.

Also cautioning the visitors in his own special way was Singh’s Congress colleague, Kapil Sibal. “You may be the master of Conjuring, but the RSS is the master of injuring :)” the former HRD minister tweeted, to be immediately retweeted by Baba Sehgal. The news has also excited rival politicians like AAP MP Bhagwant Mann. The controversial leader announced that he would soon be taking a trip to the state, to live stream all the unfolding events of so-called horror even before they can be shot by the Conjuring team.

Meanwhile, MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan hailed the development as a boon for the state. “I congratulate Sh. James Wan and Sh.

The organization’s dream project, which seeks to unite India with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar might also see Britain added to the list, if the talks go smoothly.

BJP leader Ram Madhav, who has in the past, openly advocated his desire, expressed delight at Britain’s decision. “Karma is truly a 5-letter word. Those who ruled us for more than a century are coming right back to us. How cool is that?!” Madhav told The UnReal Times, before excusing himself to see what Vice-President Hamid Ansari was up to.

Britain’s stance has drawn feverish levels of support and flak in equal measure. “It is not for nothing that we said that Modi was vindictive.

That is their ulterior motive and such is their shamelessness,” the former MP Chief Minister added, before attending to a long phone call from his household.

In a bizarre twist of fate, however, Samajwadi Party bigwig Azam Khan supported the RSS this time. “Once Akhand Bharat is formed, we’ll at least see an end to the Adityanaths, Prachis and Maharajs yelling ‘Go to Pakistan’ at the drop of a hat,” Khan said, before cheering himself with the fact that it would be far easier for him to undertake study tours with his buffaloes in London, post the Britain-Akhand Bharat union.

In London, however, the idea has been labelled a “conspiracy theory” by local residents Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi, who claimed that the proposed union was an elaborate ploy by India to do away with deportation procedures and nab them red-handed.

“We haven’t been outdoors much and we didn’t manage to play the important game against England,” said Kaur on the eve of the final against record four-time champions Australia. The surface is totally different. Everyone was in good touch and thinking what they can do for the team.

“We did get rest also because when you’re playing for a long time, you need a break. No-one wanted to take rest, everyone was so keen, everyone was on the ground and ready to deal with the situation.” Over 75,000 tickets have been sold for the finals and Harmanpreet said her team will look to enjoy the big stage and play positive cricket.",Women’s T20 World Cup: What happens if India vs Australia final gets washed out?,2042,2.105778648

“Bill bhai is awesome. By tracking his employees’ work hours like this, he made sure they worked to the maximum. I’m doing the same thing not only as far as BJP workers at our Ashoka Road HQ are concerned, but even outside of the party,” Shah winked, before sighing “Yet people accuse me of snooping! Kya yaar?!”

The BJP president added that he would continue to do so, no matter what people say. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has openly come out in support of the party president. “Now that party members know that Amit bhai is keeping watch on their number plates, it will push more people towards taking a bus or the metro, or even better – it’ll push the BJP HQ officers to purchase a fleet of identical bicycles and commute to office by using them, to outwit him. Either way, a bug plus for the environment!” Javadekar said.

The Congress party, while appreciating Shah’s disclosure, added that the main credit for this goes to former PM Jawaharlal Nehru. “Much before Rajivji discovered computers, it was Pandit Nehru who invented the art of surveillance, as has been disclosed by some of the Netaji files. So be it Bill Gates or Amit Shah’s actions, it is all due to inspiration from Panditji. So it’s not only the BJP, but even Microsoft which is trying to appropriate the Congress party’s legacy. That’s how scared the world is, of Rahul baba,” Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha told The UnReal Times, in all seriousness. We waited for a minute after his statement to see if he broke into laughter, but he didn’t. The straight face was still on.

Jha’s statement was soon corroborated by historian Ram Guha, who added that Bill Gates was in regular contact with Nehru, as a small boy in the early 1960s. “A few months after Nehru passed way in May 1964, Amit Shah was born, in October, presumably, to carry the legacy of surveillance forward?” Guha indicated.

Meanwhile, in a first, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal too, has lauded Shah for his actions. “I would’ve normally called this a repeat of the emergency, blah blah, but in this case, he rocks. The next time Delhi implements the odd-even scheme, we can hopefully use Amit bhai’s expertise to track violators effortlessly,” the AAP chief said.","Amit Shah hails Bill Gates, says he too memorizes people’s number plates to monitor them",2499,2.440976391

KOLKATA: With Amit Shah 's pitch for a nationwide NRC exercise and the recent Ayodhya verdict having received mixed reactions from various quarters, the November 25 bypolls to three Assembly seats in Bengal will be a litmus test for the TMC and the BJP, ahead of 2021 state elections.It will be the first electoral contest between the two parties since this year's Lok Sabha polls, which saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the main opposition in the state, with 18 of the 42 seats in its kitty, just four less than that of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).Two of the three Assembly constituencies - Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur - fell vacant post general election as the sitting MLAs contested and won Lok Sabha seats.bypolls were necessitated in Kaliaganj following the death of Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.Congress nominee Dhitashree Roy, also supported by the CPI(M), will take on TMC's Tapan Deb Sinha and BJP's Kamal Chandra Sarkar in Kaliaganj.In Karimpur, vacated by MLA Mahua Moitra after emerging victorious from Krishnnanagar Lok Sabha seat, the CPI(M)-Congress candidate Gholam Rabbi is contesting against BJP's Jay Prakash Majumdar and TMC's Bimalendu Singha Roy.Prem Chandra Jha of the BJP will take on Chittaranjan Mandal of the Congress-CPI(M) alliance and Pradip Sarkar of the TMC in Kharagpur Sadar Assembly seat - vacated by MLA Dilip Ghosh after winning Medinipur Lok Sabha seatThe results will be declared on November 28.Chances are likely that the saffron party's masterstroke in Maharashtra and Haryana, along with the NRC proposal and the tabling of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, would cast a shadow on the November 25 bypolls.The Ayodhya verdict, which cleared the way for construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site, might also have political ramifications, ahead of the 2021 polls.On the back foot since the NRC in Assam left out over 19 lakh people, most of them reportedly Hindus, the Ayodhya verdict has provided the BJP in West Bengal fresh ammunition to polarise the electorate.For the BJP, the challenge is to live up to its performance in the parliamentary polls, whereas the TMC will try hard to regain its lost political ground.The bypolls will also decide if the Congress and the CPI(M), which have come together after three years, will remain relevant in state politics.The Congress had bagged two seats while the CPI(M) drew a blank in the Lok Sabha polls this year.As the BJP increased its tally from two seats in 2014 to 18 seats in 2019 by bagging 40.5 per cent votes, the TMC witnessed a slump in its number of seats - down from 34 in 2014 to 22 this time.""We are confident of winning all three seats in the bypolls. The people of West Bengal have made up their mind to defeat the TMC in 2021 Assembly polls in the state,"" BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said.According to a section of state BJP leaders, the party's failure to win majority in Maharashtra and Haryana Assemblies, with a resurgent Congress putting up a good show in the northern state, might have not gone down well with its ranks in West Bengal.""In the Lok Sabha polls, we had swept Haryana and Maharashtra. But in less than six months, the Assembly poll results showed that Narendra Modi as the prime minister remains unchallenged at the national level, but the same cannot be said for the state leaders.""We are a bit apprehensive that something similar may happen in West Bengal,"" a senior state BJP leader said on the condition of anonymity.Karimpur and Kaliaganj seats have a sizeable Muslim and Dalit population. Most of the Dalits in the two seats are descendants of refugees, who fled to India during Partition and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.The exclusion of a large number of Hindus from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in neighbouring Assam is also a point of concern for the saffron party, which has promised to carry out the exercise in Bengal, if voted to power in 2021.""The panic that followed the NRC exercise in Assam has taken the winds out of the BJP's sails to an extent. So to counter the narrative of the TMC on the issue, we have come up with the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, by which all Hindu refugees will be accorded citizenship.""It remains to be seen which narrative gets accepted in Karimpur and Kaliaganj,"" the BJP leader said.The Lok Sabha election results, earlier this year, showed that the BJP was ahead in Kaliaganj and Kharagpur Sadar, while the TMC in Karimpur.In Kharagpur Sadar, which has a very high non-Bengali population, the Ram Mandir issue is expected to help the saffron party consolidate Hindu votes.However, rebel BJP leader Pradip Kumar Patnaik, who has formed the BJP Bachao Committee and is fighting as an Independent, could also play a spoiler for the saffron camp.The TMC, through its mass outreach campaign 'Didi ke Bolo' (Tell Didi) over the last three months, hopes to revive much of its ground lost to the BJP.""The people of West Bengal, in the last five-six months, have understood that the BJP is a communal and divisive force. In the bypolls, we will win all three seats.""Apart from local issues and rural distress caused due to the Centre's economic policies, we have highlighted the BJP's malicious plans to impose NRC in the state, which will turn legal citizens into refugees,"" TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said.The CPI(M)-led Left Front and the Congress, both fighting for their political existence in Bengal, have sealed a seat adjustment for Monday's bypolls.The Congress will contest Kaliaganj and Kharagpur Sadar seats, while the Left Front will fight from Karimpur. It will be a challenge for the two parties to cut into minority votes of the TMC and anti-establishment votes of the BJP.""We are hopeful that people will realize that the Congress-CPI(M) alliance can be the only alternative to the TMC, as a communal force like the BJP will never be accepted in the state,"" Congress state president Somen Mitra said.","Bengal bypolls litmus test for TMC, BJP ahead of 2021 assembly elections",6158,2.614485222

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:29 IST

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party.","As Congress scrambles to save MP govt, buzz grows of internal rift in BJP",3065,1.827079935

The BJP’s assertion comes amid the Shiv Sena’s demand for an equal share in power and the two saffron parties occupying the chief minister’s post on a rotational basis. But Shiv Sena is currently disagreeing with everything that the BJP says. Today was the heights of such type of disagreement, as BJP praised Aditya Thackeray for his work done for the youth, Shiv Sena disagreed and called Aditya a product of nepotism.

Sanjay Raut, the Shiv Sena MP has said that his party will not agree with BJP at any cost as that will be an insult to the 50:50 formula suggested by Amit Shah himself. BJP meanwhile has a new plan. It will announce in a press conference that Shiv Sena has decided to not form the government in Maharashtra with BJP, and Shiv Sena out of the sheer habit will come out in open and say that they will indeed form the government with BJP.

Faking News Reporter spoke to Sanjay Raut and he had this to say, “Our policy is simple, we cannot agree with anyone. In fact, there are disagreements among my own party members. We believe that dissent is an important part of democracy. And Shiv Sainiks will always disagree with everyone.”

Lalu Prasad’s elder son and RJD MLA Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday made a sudden appearance at the party’s state headquarters in Patna and held a long discussion with youth and student wing workers and declared he was back to active politics.

Yadav reached the RJD office at Veer Chand Patel Marg in the afternoon wearing his trademark ‘bhasma tilak’. He has been keeping a low profile for the past several months on account of alleged differences with his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav, a claim he has refused, and estrangement with his wife of six months from whom he has sought divorce. After holding over two-hour discussions with the party workers, the former Bihar minister addressed a press conference where he showered praise on Rahul Gandhi for leading the Congress to victory in the assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

He asserted that he considered the BJP-RSS combine as the principal opponent in Bihar. “I have returned to Bihar after receiving the blessings of Lord Krishna during my pilgrimage. The state will emerge as Kurukshetra in the Lok Sabha polls and our detractors will be slayed with the Sudarshan Chakra of popular vote,” he said.

Yadav refused to take any queries on his decision to divorce Aishwarya Rai, daughter of fellow RJD MLA Chandrika Rai, whom he had married in May this year.

Replying to a query, he reiterated that he saw Tejashwi as “Arjuna” and vowed to play the role of Lord Krishna who was the warrior prince’s charioteer in the Mahabharata.

Speculations have been rife that Tej Pratap Yadav has been unhappy over being overshadowed by his younger brother, who is considered a favourite of their father and has emerged as the RJD’s de facto leader in the absence of Lalu Prasad, who is serving sentences in fodder scam cases. There have also been reports that Tej Pratap enjoys the support of their eldest sister Misa Bharti, the only daughter of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi to have entered politics and is said to be uncomfortable with the leadership of the more suave and savvy younger brother. Tej Pratap, however, evaded queries ion it.

He also said he had no plans to return to 10, Circular Road, the bungalow allotted to his mother in her capacity as a former Chief Minister in a clear hint that he was still upset with her over her not supporting his decision to divorce Aishwarya.

“I have requested the state government to allot a bungalow in my name. I have also tried to telephonically contact Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the issue,” he said.

Earlier this year, Tej Pratap Yadav had vacated the bungalow allotted to him while he was the health minister, claiming Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi had “released ghosts” inside the premises. Tejashwi, however, continues to occupy the bungalow allotted to him while he was the Deputy CM and is fighting a legal battle against efforts by the state government to get him evicted.","‘I’ve returned,’ RJD’s Tej Pratap Yadav says he is back to active politics",2964,1.417004049

In 2018, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress told us two different stories about India. This is not surprising, for politics is often about storytelling. Indian politics is no exception. And that is why the BJP and Congress’ stories of 2018 will be central to how 2019 shapes up. There are three distinct elements of the story both sides are telling. They revolve around quality of life; corruption; and identity, democracy and institutions.

The-quality-of-life story

In the BJP story, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government fixed India’s welfare architecture. By using the socio-economic caste census, geospatial tagging, Aadhaar and direct benefits transfer, the government identified the needy beneficiaries. It ensured the end — or minimisation — of leakages. It eliminated intermediaries. And it delivered benefits.

In this narrative, the government has finally provided housing to rural Indians. It has provided toilets. It has provided electricity. And it has also ensured the distribution of gas cylinders —under the Ujjwala scheme — to over 50 million beneficiaries. Besides the individual benefits, the government also claims that rural roads have witnessed a wide expansion.

And so here is the centrepiece of the Modi story: a government committed to the ease of living; a government committed to the poorest and most invisible Indians; a government that has changed the way rural India lives, cooks and travels.

In the Congress’s story, the government has destroyed the dreams and aspirations of the two most important demographic groups — farmers and the youth.

It is, the Opposition narrative goes, the government’s dramatically poor economic management that has created a debilitating situation. It announced demonetisation, squeezed the economy, disrupted every sector, jolted growth and destroyed jobs. It pushed through a poorly designed Goods and Services Tax regime, which India’s small and medium scale industries were thoroughly unprepared for, especially because it came soon after demonetisation.

This story holds that manufacturing goals have all but collapsed, with Make in India simply not able to generate the scale of jobs needed to accommodate a million-plus people who enter the Indian workforce every year.

The story in agriculture, in this narrative, is particularly distressing. The government has failed to provide the minimum support prices according to the Swaminathan commission’s formula. Farmers are also suffering from enormous debt.

The Congress’s story hinges on acute economic distress across urban and rural India — with the country represented by the angry, aspirational, impatient young men and women seeking jobs.

The corruption story

The second axis of the debate revolves around corruption, a key plank of the BJP’s victory in 2014.

The BJP story goes back to “legacy issues” it has had to grapple with, particularly in the realm of non-performing assets. This itself, the BJP holds, was a function of crony capitalism that marked the Congress regimes where phone calls to bankers led to loans which were unviable in the boom years.

The government claims it recognised the problem. It has sought to address the underlying roots of this crisis by bringing in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code so that there is an exit for bad capital. It has, through legislations like RERA, ensured that the real estate and construction sector has stronger regulation.

The BJP story also holds that central-level corruption has reduced drastically. No big scam has been institutionally proven in this period. And the PM in particular represents an image of integrity.

In the Opposition’s narrative, the government is the epitome of crony capitalism. Rahul Gandhi’s attack on Rafale is meant to portray Modi as embedded with corporate interests. It has picked on Vijay Mallya’s exit from India as the proof of government’s collusion. And the Congress cites Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi bank fraud as absolute proof of how this is a government complicit with corruption. It portrays demonetisation as a scam.

The identity story

The BJP believes, and would like Indian citizens to believe, that the nation has finally found its rightful place on the world stage. This is as much as function of Modi’s diplomacy as India’s renewed confidence, which comes from a strong sense of nationalism. This nationalism, in turn, has a strong cultural — read Hindu — ethos.

Minority appeasement, this story goes, has ended. Citizens are treated equally. The Hindus are no longer ashamed to be Hindus.

The Congress, and the wider Opposition, believes India is at a turning point and its nationalism project, instead of becoming stronger, is in jeopardy.

In this view, nationalism has come to be increasingly associated with Hindu majoritarianism. It has become synonymous with marginalisation and public disdain for minorities. There is impunity for mob violence, especially when directed at minorities.

No two stories could be more at odds with each other. Which of these a majority of Indian citizens believes will determine who gets to govern the country for the next five years.","BJP, Congress’ stories script a political thriller in 2018",5176,2.163833076
3429,0,"Although he recently took sanyas from Twitter, Rajdeep Sardesai made an exception and offered to commemorate Sachin’s 40th birthday celebrations by going down memory lane and tweeting key moments in the little master’s glittering career. With an Old Monk in hand, soulful music in the background, and footage of the Sachin’s greatest knocks, Rajdeep began his tweet-marathon:

India’s tour of Pakistan in 1989: It all began in 1989 during India’s tour of Pakistan. It was the pre-liberalization era. Sunny’s departure had left a giant void in Indian cricket. Paaji referred to Kapil Dev. On November 15, 1989 in Karachi, a curly haired 15 year old made his Test debut, taking his guard against a formidable pace battery – Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. It was baptism by fire; A new star lit up the cricketing firmament, one whose spectral luminosity the world had never seen before and perhaps never will.

December 1989; 4th Test, Sialkot: In the 4th Test, a Waqar Younus bouncer hit Sachin on the face, drawing blood. He nonchalantly wiped the blood off his face, declined treatment, and resumed his batting.

The great man’s ODI debut began on a low key note as he was dismissed without troubling the scores. But then all great rivers begin as trickles.

India’s summer tour of England; Aug 14, 1990, Old Trafford: And soon, Sachin scored the first of his 100 centuries, fittingly enough against England at the age of 17 years, 112 days, the second youngest Test centurion ever. The floodgates had opened.

Oct 1991, Sharjah: And on some occasions, he carried the day for his country with his bowling. In Sharjah, against the West Indies, Sachin, with his military medium pace, accounted for four West Indian scalps.

Within 3 years of his debut, Indian batting came to revolve around and be over-reliant on Sachin. If Sachin failed with his bat, India lost. If Sachin fired, India won. A bit like the way Mumbai Indians now depend on Sachin in the converse sense. (Editor: Hehe. Just kidding)

Mar 1992, World Cup in Australia: So India went into the 1992 World Cup, with Sachin as the lynch-pin of the batting line up. We lost to most teams, except the team that would go on to lift the cup. Sachin’s first of the many memorable knocks in ensuring that India had a 100% success rate against the old enemy in high voltage World Cup encounters:

Nov 1993: Fast forward to The Hero Cup in 1993 involving India, South Africa, West Indies, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe to commemorate Cricket Association of Bengal’s golden jubilee . In a cliff-hanger semi-final against South Africa, where both teams hung on till the very end, it all boiled down to South Africa requiring 4 runs off the final over. It required nerves of steel to bowl that over. And whom does India turn to?

March 27, 1994, Eden Park, Auckland: Meanwhile pressure was building on Sachin to score his first ODI century. Would opening the innings do the trick? Sachin opened the innings in ODIs for the first time in New Zealand, scoring 82 off 49 balls.

24th May, 1995: Sachin scored off the field too, getting hitched to Anjali, for the start of a very fruitful and unbeaten partnership.

1996 World Cup, India: India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-hosted the World Cup. Luckily, no Bangladesh then. Sachin once again led the charge.

March 1996, World Cup Quarter-Finals: India met Pakistan in the quarterfinals in Bangalore. Sachin laid the foundation for India’s competitive total with a well compiled 43 with Sidhu going on to be India’s top scorer. Jadeja’s lofty hits, particularly off Waqar Younis, would propel India to a formidable total. Now it all depended on India’s fast slow bowlers, messrs Prasad and Srinath, aided by Jumbo, to see India through:

Mar 1996: Alas, India would lose to those annoying Lankans in the semis in Eden Gardens. Sachin would have to wait for another 16 years to savour India’s triumph.

India’s tour of England, 1996: The summer of 1996 saw India touring England. The first Test at Edgbaston established an unwritten rule: when Sachin Tendulkar got out, India collapsed and when he held the innings together, India scored.

The otherwise unremarkable series, which India, in keeping with its very poor away record, would go on to lose, witnessed the golden debut of two superstars at the Mecca of cricket, Lord’s- Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. After the series, Sachin would take over the captaincy of the team from a discredited Azharuddin.

21st Oct, 1996, Bangalore: The Titan Cup saw one of the greatest ever matches to be played the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore. A Sachin Tendulkar-led India took on the mighty Aussies. A fine ton by Aussie skipper Mark Tayler led Australia to a fairly competitive total of 215. The pressure was on Sachin to deliver, as wickets kept falling at the other end. And in style, he did, with a steady knock of 88. The real show stealers, however, were local boys Javagal Srinath and Anil Kumble, who did the impossible, with the bat and took India home, with a key partnership at the end. To this day, people still talk about the partnership and will probably never stop.

1997 – West Indies tour: India toured the West Indies in 1997, with many players surely cursing and asking themselves why they did so. Team India put out a disappointing performance, the home team only seemed to comfortable. Sachin’s captaincy began to be questioned – was it the pressure which was affecting him?

1997 – Independence Cup: The Chinnaswamy stadium has always been home to some of Tendulkar’s finest innings and this day witnessed yet another mind-blowing, exhilarating display of batting from the little Master. There are some cricketers who are called “One-match wonders” – they play one match, make an impact and are never to be seen again. This match brought in New Zealand bowler Heath Davis into the fray, only for Sachin Tendulkar to thrash him to all corners of the ground. Heath Davis didn’t ever play against India again. One nightmare was probably enough for a lifetime.

April 1st, 1998: This was no April Fool’s joke – A day on which Sachin Tendulkar stunned the Aussies with his bowling, scalping 5 wickets for 32 runs, marking his career-best bowling figures and also a fine welcome for the Nehru Stadium into the world of cricket. Kochi would later go on to become another lucky ground for Tendulkar, as he would take another 5 wicket haul against Pakistan.

22nd April 1998, Sharjah: Tendulkar may be remembered in the cricketing world as the greatest cricketer ever and this one innings is proof enough as to why. That hot day in Sharjah made its presence felt with a desert storm, but soon made way for what can only be termed as the biggest storm in the history of cricket. It is said that Tony Grieg could not speak for 2 days after presiding over the commentary for Tendulkar’s innings in this match. Pundits regard this as one of Sachin’s most domineering knocks in which he single-handedly won the cup for India.

1999 India Pakistan Test Series: The two match India-Pakistan Test series followed a third Test as part of the Asia cup, saw Sachin at his very best. Sachin nearly took India to victory in Chennai before back spasms and an inexplicable lower order collapse saw Pakistan edge past India.

The Chennai crowd, to add to fans’ chagrin, applauded the Pakistanis, thus earning themselves the reputation of being very knowledgeable and sporting in cricketing matters.

In Delhi, Kumble took a record 10 wickets in the final innings to square the series. In the final Test, Shoaib Akhtar ripped Sachin’s middle stump to dismiss him for duck, putting Pakistan ahead.

India would lose the final Test, with Sachin getting run out after colliding with Wasim Akram. The Kolkata crowd, which was far more knowledgeable in these matters, did not turn up on the final day as Pakistan took the series.

The 1999 World Cup in England: Sachin was once again the fulcrum of India’s batting as India embarked on its WC campaign in England. Sachin’s father and great poet, Shri Ramesh Tendulkar, passed away, forcing Sachin to return to India for the last rites. India narrowly lost its league match to Zimbabwe in Sachin’s absence. Considering the carry over point system, that proved crucial, jeopardizing India’s chances of making it to the semis. Sachin returned and scored a fighting century against Kenya.

Indian cricket would be hit by the match fixing scandal in the late 90s. Sachin would consider it the most difficult period of his career.

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Thursday parted ways with the Left Front and Congress on the issue of ""jointly opposing"" the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. It also backed out from moving an all-party resolution in the state assembly against the Centre's contentious moves, as West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee expressed her ""disappointment"" with the ""nasty politics"" of the two parties.Mamata cited the violence during Wednesday's all-India strike, called by central trade unions against ""the BJP government's anti-worker policies"", and announced that she would be staying away from the meeting of opposition parties in New Delhi next Monday to register her protest against the Left Front and Congress's ""hooliganism"" in Bengal. The meeting was called by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi over the incidents of campus violence and the CAA.Trinamool's decision comes two days before PM Modi's visit to Kolkata to attend the 150th-anniversary celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust.Wednesday's strike call had turned violent in Malda district after several police vehicles were torched. Buses and motor-bikes were damaged, and highways, crucial road junctions and railway tracks were blockaded in several spots in the state.""Let the people of India know that I have dropped my plans to visit Delhi on January 13 to protest against their hooliganism. I choose to withdraw even though I had urged opposition parties to meet,"" the Bengal CM said.""I will protest against CAA and NRC and these people will set buses on fire, plant bombs under trains? I won't tolerate this. The state Congress has become their new friend. These leaders are into nasty politics and have hatched a conspiracy against people,"" she said. ""If needed, I will fight alone,"" she said.Trinamool has also backed out of an all-party resolution in the Bengal assembly against CAA-NRC which the Left parties and Congress had insisted on.Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra said Thursday's development was ""expected"".

3432,0,"Taking a cue from the Delhi government’s plan to tackle pollution, the Maharashtra government has issued a diktat regulating the use of footpaths for sleeping by pavement dwellers and other homeless Mumbaikars.

“Henceforth, Mumbaikars can sleep only on odd numbered footpaths on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, and only on even numbered footpaths on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. This is for their own safety,” said a spokesperson for the Government emerging from a hurriedly convened cabinet meeting.

Acting quickly to implement the plan, the government has already begun to number all the pavements in the city.

“With this measure, we hope to cut down the risk to the footpath dwellers at least by 50%,” the spokesperson added. “This scheme will benefit not just the footpath dwellers, but Salman Khan too. It will reduce the risk of him, ahem, I mean, his driverless car running over innocent folks and save him a lot of time that he could instead use to make Dabangg 4, 5, 6 and Prem Ratan Dhan Payo 2, 3, 4.”

According to sources, the government originally mulled over the idea of bringing the odd-even rule on driving on footpaths, but then decided against it after realizing that it wouldn’t apply on a rich man like Salman Khan who has plenty of cars.

Like in Delhi, footpath dwellers of Mumbai initially grumbled about the government’s decision, but news about Salman Khan’s acquittal soon permeated throughout the city, and everyone quickly fell in line.

“We’ll figure out a pooling system. No problem. I will bunk with Ramu in the adjoining street every other day, and he’ll bunk with me here on the rest of the days. We are nothing but adaptable,” said Sonu, a footpath dweller.

Australia are focussing not only on the wily Poonam Yadav but preparing to take on India’s spin-heavy attack by practising against “slow spinners” ahead of Sunday’s Women’s T20 World Cup final. Poonam had bamboozled Australia in the opening game, snapping four wickets to power India to a 17-run win but skipper Meg Lanning urged her side to brace up for other threats including the left-arm Indian bowlers. “It’s not just Poonam we need to worry about. They’ve got some really good left-armers too, such as Rajeshwari Gayakwad. They’ve got a really strong line-up right through their bowlers and they have spinners who can change their pace,” Lanning said.

“We will be facing some slow spinners at training. We’ll be as prepared as we can be and making sure we adjust to what’s happening at the time.” India’s batting also boasts of young Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana besides all-rounder Deepti Sharma and Lanning said her bowling unit has to make the necessary adjustments when coming across India’s good batting unit.

Also read: What happens if India vs Australia final gets washed out?

“Obviously Smriti Mandhana is a world-class player too and Deepti Sharma has also played well against us. We feel our bowling line-up can adjust to different things,” she said. “We are very well prepared for what the game will throw at us. It’s going to be a tough, hard battle tomorrow against India but I feel we are as ready as we can be to take it on.”

Four-time champions Australia are no stranger to title wins. Lanning herself had guided the team to glory at the last edition in 2018 but the skipper said it will the “toughest battle” and “biggest moment” of her career when she walks out to a sold-out crowd at the MCG.

Saurashtra, led by the inspirational Jaydev Unadkat, will back themselves to win an elusive Ranji Trophy title at home but a buoyant Bengal will be no pushovers in what promises to be an absorbing final beginning on Monday.

Both the teams are desperate to go all the way with Saurashtra reaching their fourth final in eight seasons while Bengal has not tasted success in the premier domestic event since the 1989-90 triumph.

While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest at the SCA Stadium, which is also the venue for the final.

There will also be star power on display with Test regulars Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha joining the Saurashtra and Bengal squads respectively, having returned from New Zealand.

In fact, Pujara was very much Saurasthra’s 12th man with Unadkat being in constant touch with his senior teammate during the hard-fought semifinal. Now his physical presence in the all-important game will be a big boost to the side.

READ: India’s Shafali Verma breaks world record in T20 WC final

Saurashtra would not have ended up on the right side of the result against Gujarat if it wasn’t for Unadkat, who has had a sensational run this season with 65 wickets at an average of 12.17 and is three shy of the all-time record of 68 scalps, set by Bihar spinner Ashutosh Aman last season.

The left-arm pacer single-handedly led his team to victory on day five earlier this week with a seven-wicket haul on a flat surface, including the scalps of a set Parthiv Patel and Chiragh Gandhi, who had brought Gujarat back in the game from a hopeless 63 for five while chasing 327.

Unadkat’s stellar performances over the course of the season has put him back in national reckoning but in his own words, they would count for little if the team doesn’t go all the way.

Not just with the ball, he also inspired with his captaincy and one example of that was when he promoted number 11 Chetan Sakariya, who shared a crucial 90-run stand with Arpit Vasavada (139) after the hosts collapsed to 15 for five.

The skipper is leading from the front but will expect more from his fellow pacers who have not done much to write home about this season.

Besides Pujara, the team’s leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson will be expected to shoulder the batting responsibilities.

Saurashtra will be wary of Bengal’s potent pace attack which fashioned their comprehensive win over eight-time champions Karnataka.

The pace trio of Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep were on fire in the semifinal and has contributed significantly to the team’s overall success.

Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed has come of age this season and is the team’s joint highest wicket-taker with 30 scalps alongside Kumar and Akash Deep.

The onus in the batting department lies on veteran Manoj Tiwary, who has been the team’s leading run-getter with 672 runs from 10 games but has not fired after his couple of match-winning half-centuries on a challenging track in Patiala.

3440,0,"A delegation of leaders from secular parties met President Pranab Mukherjee, demanding the Election Commission hold immediate elections across the country to elect a new Leader of Opposition, considering the fractured mandate for secular parties. After the meeting, the delegation, unable to agree on a common spokesperson, decided to release the following press statement: “The world media is laughing at India right now. The joke goes that until last week, India had no government, now it has no opposition. Thereby, we immediately demand elections to be held throughout the country for the election of a secular Opposition leader.”

The delegation comprised the senior leaders of ‘We, The Third Front’ (WTF) including J Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav, Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav, and Prashant Bhushan. Initially, there was chaos at the Rashtrapati Bhavan as every member of the delegation wanted to be the first one to meet the President. Eventually, the commotion was settled by deciding that the delegation would form a circle, instead of a line, around the President.

Nitish Kumar and Mayawati also had a separate meeting to discuss this matter. Mayawati, who neither controls a state government nor any MPs, welcomed the idea of fresh elections just for opposition parties and went so far as to claim it was guaranteed under the MgNREGA. Nitish Kumar, who is newly unemployed and recruiting actively, appeared to be energized after a long time at the idea of elections in which Narendra Modi was not allowed to participate.

Arvind Kejriwal, who had been so bored sitting at home after the elections that he decided to spend some time in Tihar Jail instead, is reported to be particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity for another round of media attention. Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party has threatened a dharna and hunger strike in front of the Election Commission offices till the dates of the election are announced. Anna Hazare, in response, has claimed that he supports the Election Commissioners but not the Election Commission.

The Indian media, which had been anxious about the end of election season entertainment, appeared to be rejuvenated at the prospect of another long campaigning season. Reporters who had fervently covered every rally and hologram of Modi had suddenly found themselves with nothing to do when the election results were announced. Hindi electronic media, led by India TV and Aaj Tak, had already sent teams of idle reporters to towns and villages to find TRP-worthy stories including any yogis with miracle powers, pets who needed to be rescued from wells, and latest gossip about cricketers and Bollywood. But the possibility of endlessly analyzing speeches by explosive leaders such as Mamata Banerjee, Azam Khan, and Imran Masood has galvanized the TV channels.

Arnab Goswami, the official spokesman for the Indian media, appeared to be particularly fired up. “Here is what I have to say about this”, said Arnab waving his hand emphatically to make his point. “Five years is too long between election cycles and there should never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever be more than six months without some sort of campaign required from political parties. I think the idea of an election just for Opposition parties are such a brilliant idea that I have decided to announce it exclusively on Times Now.”

Rahul Gandhi, vice president of Indian National Congress, was not amused when asked about the idea of another election. Speaking from Geneva, Switzerland, where he had come for a much deserved vacation from the grueling two day CWC session, the Nehru-Gandhi scion said, “I am 103% against the idea of a election. This is the problem with the system that instead of empowering women, all the system wants is elections.”

Priyanka, who was sitting close by, added, “I think it is an insult to my family that we are expected to campaign so soon after the last election. After all the sacrifices my family has made for this country, would asking for 5 years of privacy be too much?”

Media reports have indicated that Sushma Swaraj might contest these elections to get back her former job as the Leader of the Opposition. Sushma has reportedly approached Amit Shah to be her campaign manager.",Third-Front demands fresh elections to elect Opposition leader,4279,2.103295162

Even The Hindu is ignoring the CPI-M these days. An aggravated CPI-M General Secretary, Prakash Karat, has finally decided to mend fences through this open letter to satire sites, in which he makes the earnest case as to why the Left also deserves to be made fun of:

I know that the petty bourgeois is fascinated with the personality cult of Modi. This is not good for the country, but that is not what I am writing to you on.

I see your sites and other news media, and they are full of stories on Rahul Gandhi and the Congress. Whether he speaks or does not speak, whether he speaks physics, history or biology people find something to make fun of. People also make fun of secularism and such related topics. Win or lose, he is at least covered in these sites.

Yes, the Congress may have been beaten out of power across states. But that does not mean our achievements are any less significant! Before Congress projected its Sardar, we had our own Sardar. He was a king-maker but we sidelined him and his approach. We did not allow Jyoti Basu to become prime minister.

We were strong in three states and had presence across the country. UPA 1 was not possible with our support. We were in power in Bengal for more than 30 years. Now see what I and my Politburo have achieved! We tried to dethrone Manmohan and made him “Singh the King”. We have been so badly beaten in Bengal that the next elections in Bengal will be contested between the TMC and the BJP.

In Kerala, we are facing notoriety for killing our own partymen. Our most popular mass leader is a 90 year old man, who we don’t want to acknowledge. Our union comrades in TN have ensured that Sriperumbudur is no threat to Shenzhen.

We are the only party to have been outmaneuvered by the Congress. We have seen our space being occupied by the likes of AAP and are happily losing ground.

Sadly, our presence on TV channels has also shrunk. Nobody invites Comrade Yechury (not that I am unhappy with that). Think of Comrade Brinda Karat! Nobody wants to feature her and the embedded red traffic light on her forehead in any channel! She is now reduced to blogging about injustices in Tirupathi temple administration.

While I can understand them ignoring us, why are you folks also doing likewise? What is not to make fun of “class based leaders”, without mass connect getting beaten up electorally? What is not to make fun of a party that introduced the bomb culture getting outbombed? You would rather make fun of Kejriwal and his muffler?”

Please, make fun of us. It did hurt to get beaten and outwitted by Manmohan Singh. But it hurts even more, when people don’t see anything to laugh in that. Come on! I was India Today’s man of the year in 2007!”

A press note issued by Pakistan’s advisor to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaz Aziz, read: “The Terrorist Peaceful Republic of Pakistan hereby relinquishes any and all claims made on India occupied Kashmir. We shall withdraw petitions and applications and other communications from all establishments and forums. Instead, we demand that JNU be handed over to us. Looking at the public anger, hate and disgust directed at the premier institution by the Indian people, this deal seems fair. This will solve so many issues between the countries.”

A senior ISI official on condition of anonymity said, “Things are getting tough, yaar. We have already lost three wars over Kashmir. And now in the name of death by a thousand cuts, we are spending so much money and time. You can’t imagine how tough it is to train personnel, brainwash them and sneak them into India. And for what? Control over some dumb guys who throw stones? For God’s sake, those guys threw stones even on the Indian army personnel when they were rescuing them during the floods! Inshallah, even if we win Kashmir how can we know that they won’t throw stones at us. They are not worth it. I have always maintained that!”

“JNU, on the other hand, is a different story,” he added. “’Shahid Afzal Guru amar rahe, Kashmir mange azadi, Bharat ki barbadi tak jung chalegi’ Wow! Even we can’t come up with such things. These guys are awesome! They can cause a lot more damage to the Indians than the brainwashed assholes we send across the border day in and day out.

“It is easy to catch a koala from one of the Indian forest reserves, transport it to Australia and get it to cuddle him in front of the camera,” scoffed Khurshid. “If you don’t believe me, check its flight ticket for Gods sake.”

When we pointed out that koalas are endemic to Australia, and that it is unlikely the PM would have found one in India, the former external affairs minister called this correspondent a guttersnipe and got his guards to throw him out of his bungalow.

The UnReal Times‘ Australian correspondent, Alana Rice, who incidentally dates a certain upcoming Australian cricket star, happened to be present at the time Chappell delivered the dressing room pep talk. The following is the transcript of the discussion that transpired.

Boisterous and noisy scenes are witnessed in the Australian dressing room. The camaraderie is evident as players are seen laughing with/at each other, thoroughly enjoying themselves after a tough training session.

“SHUT UP !!!”

A sudden hush descends on the room, as players look around to find the source of the interruption. Greg Chappell stands at the door with an expression that could curdle the blood of the baddest guy in Australia. A shudder runs through the dressing room, as Chappell strides grandly to the center of the room. There’s pin-drop silence, as the players watch the legend with their mouths open, dumbstruck with awe.

“Gentlemen,” Chappell announces sternly, “as you may well know, I have been invited by the Australian Cricket Board to prepare you for the upcoming series with India. I will start by telling you the one thing you must know to have any chance of winning this series – how to get Sachin Tendulkar out.”

There’s a collective, sharp intake of breath as players take this information in. Clarke lets out a shrill scream before muffling it hurriedly with his palm, furtively looking to his left and right to check if anyone heard it.

“Yes, that’s right,” continues Chappell as he paces the room, the clicking sound of his boots echoing loudly in the room. “I am going to tell you something that no one in the entire world can claim to know.”

The bowlers murmur under their breath, trembling with excitement as they attempt to grapple with this revelation.

“Do you think it is his tendency to lean a bit too far while driving before he gets set?” murmurs Watson to Clarke.

“Do you think it is his weakness against the incoming ball early in his innings?” whispers Johnson to Siddle.

“Even if it is, what are you gonna do about it, huh? You can’t swing a ball for nuts these days!” retorts Siddle.

“Silence!” Chappell’s voice cuts through the murmur like a whip. The players fall silent once again.

“The weakness in Sachin’s armour that I am about to reveal has its roots in his childhood. It took me months of painstaking research and years of work in India to discover this. Watch this clip carefully,” says Chappell, as he gestures to an assistant to turn on the projector.

The players watch attentively as an old Pepsi ad comes up on the screen. The ad shows Carl Hooper and Shane Warne messing around in a Pepsi store where they find a young Sachin Tendulkar on the floor in a zonked out state. Sniggering at Sachin’s short-term amnesia, they wheel him out to the airport to fly him out of the country, only for Sachin to leap out of his chair at the sight of the plane yelling “Aila plane!” At this point, Chappell pauses the video.

“THIS IS IT, GUYS!” screams Chappell triumphantly. “This is the secret! The little master CANNOT resist airplanes. You arrange for an airplane to fly overhead when Sachin is batting, and he cannot help but look up and remark ‘Aila plane!’ With this insight, you can get him ten out of ten times!”

There’s a minute of silence as the players look at each other, utterly bewildered. After what appears to be an eternity, Ponting speaks out.

“Mate, are you shitting me?”

“Yeah Greg,” adds Clarke, emboldened, “this is bullshit. We tried this long back. We held an exhitibition match near the Melbourne airport back in 2003. Sachin hit an unbeaten 145 and left poor Johnson in tears”

“Er..” Chappell struggles for words as the players angrily converge towards him.

Thinking quickly, Chappell blurts out, “Michael, Haddin has 2.5 GB of Lara Bingle bikini pics on his hard-drive.”

“WHAT?!?” Clarke turns abruptly towards Haddin. “IS THAT TRUE?”

“Uh… Watson gave it to me,” stammers Haddin, backing away. Shrieking like a teenage girl, Clarke grabs Watson’s hair with one hand, and with the other grabs Haddin by his collar. The trio begin punching and scratching each other. Within a matter of minutes, the rest of the team has joined the scuffle.

In the melee, Chappell slowly slips away to the door, grinning from ear to ear, “Hehe, yet another dressing room falls to Gregger the wrecker!”",TRANSCRIPT: Greg Chappell leaks Sachin’s weaknesses to the Australian team,4501,2.488335925

MUMBAI: When chief minister Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena expands his cabinet on December 30, controversial NCP partyman Ajit Pawar will be inducted as deputy chief minister. However, he may not take up the home portfolio, which already is with the Shiv Sena but which may be controlled soon by another NCP leader.If a senior NCP partyman is to be believed, Ajit Pawar was to be brought into the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s cabinet on November 28 itself, when Thackeray took oath as CM at Shivaji Park . However, NCP president Sharad Pawar decided it would be best to induct him at a later stage in view of Ajit’s “mistake” of joining hands with the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis.Ajit had been sworn in as Fadnavis’s deputy on November 23 before the second Fadnavis-led regime collapsed in just 80 hours as Pawar’s ‘rebel’ nephew resigned following his inability to mobilize the support of NCP legislators to keep the government afloat.The NCP partyman said the party had the option of allotting Ajit the water resources department which he had held earlier, home, or finance and planning. “However, Ajit Pawar has informed the NCP leadership that he would prefer the finance and planning department and that he is not keen on either water resources or home,” he said.The NCP partyman said that along with Ajit Pawar, 36 new cabinet members – 13 belonging to the NCP, 13 to the Sena and 10 to Congress will be sworn in on December 30.","Ajit Pawar to be deputy CM, but may not get home",1612,1.550868486

A BCCI man argued, “This is what happens when you do too many reruns of a fluky win from 8 years back. Just by fans wearing T-shirts and getting dressed like tigers, the team does not win, does it? But that is not what troubles me.”

We asked, “Then?”

“I can understand, if this is about Virat Kohli or Shikar Dhawan or Raina. But a country is making so much noise on a no ball for Rohit Sharma? You think the BCCI are such fools that they would instruct umpires not to give Rohit out? Come on yaar! These are guys who could not chase 100 runs in their backyard against our A team! And if Rohit had got out, Dhoni would have come out and continued thrashing them.”

“What do you plan to do?”

“We are observing the situation. If they continue to make these noises, there is only one choice.”

“What is that?”

“There is a tour to Bangladesh that India is supposed to make after IPL. If they continue talking up, then we will not send anyone from the regular Indian team.”

“Then what happens?”

“See, Karnataka is thrashing everyone in domestic cricket. Domestic players are asking us to spare them from this team. Even Rest of India is no match for them. Karnataka too has asked us for more competition. So, our plan B is to actually send the Karnataka team as India to Bangladesh and then watch the fun.”

It is not at all surprising that 95 % of hotel reviews in Maharashtra are written by the MLAs and not general tourists. MLAs from all parties have been staying at hotels and traveling from one hotel to another.

In their free time, they have become full-time hotel reviewers. In fact, the words and phrases that they use are so difficult even for a normal reviewer to use.

Faking News survey found that all sophisticated reviews are written by the MLAs so that they get even better service when they return to the hotel after the next election. It is becoming a norm in India that after an election, the MLA or MP goes straight to a hotel or a chartered flight. BJP MLAs were so scared of Amit Shah’s visit to Mumbai that they also chose a hotel to hide, it was only later did they realize that Amit Shah is coming to buy the NCP MLAs and not the BJP MLAs.

It might have taken a little longer than expected, but India all-rounder Hardik Pandya is set to return to the national team for the ODI series against South Africa that gets underway in Dharamsala on March 12.

Speaking to IANS, sources in the know of developments said that the DY Patil T20 tournament worked as the perfect training ground for the all-rounder who has been working on his back ever since he underwent surgery in the UK.

“He is fit and is set to return to the national team. Having first undergone rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy and now his performance in the T20 tournament has pretty much made it clear that he is fit to return to the fold,” the source said.

Post his surgery, Pandya had initially hired the services of Delhi Capitals trainer Rajnikanth Sivagnanam to undergo rehab with Team India physio Yogesh Parmar keeping an eye on Pandya’s progress post his back surgery in October.

But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly made it clear that all players must report to the NCA to undergo rehab.

The Indian team management then convinced Pandya to head to the NCA when he trained with the players at the Wankhede Stadium before the ODI against Australia. “The team management spoke to him when he trained with Virat Kohli and boys on the eve of the opening ODI against Australia at the Wankhede Stadium and asked him to complete his rehab at the NCA,” a source said.

Having completed the process, he returned to the field in the ongoing T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai and has already hit two hundreds.

Speaking on his fitness, Pandya said: “For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”

As for his blistering tons, Pandya said he keeps things simple. “If it’s there in my arc, I just back myself and go for it. Most of the time, it comes out pretty well.

NEW DELHI: The CBI has filed an FIR against former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat and his then cabinet colleague Harak Singh Rawat, who is now a member of the state's BJP-led government, for alleged attempts of horse trading in 2016, which was caught on tape by an editor of a news channel, officials said on Wednesday.The agency had conducted an preliminary enquiry into the alleged horse trading attempt on March 23, 2016 when the state was under President's rule It sent the tape to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Gandhinagar in Gujarat for analysis which opined that the recording was ""genuine"" and there was no evidence of any ""addition/deletion/insertion/tampering/morphing"" in the video files.The video purportedly showed the Congress leader discussing money to win back the support of disgruntled MLAs who had crossed over to the BJP so that he could get back to power.Recently, the Uttarakhand High Court gave its nod to the CBI to go ahead with its investigation in the case and lodge an FIR against Rawat after the agency submitted a report in a sealed cover on the preliminary inquiry.Besides Harish Rawat and Harak Singh Rawat, who joined the BJP later and is now a minister in the Trivender Singh Rawat-led cabinet, the CBI has also booked editor-in-chief of Noida-based Samachar Plus channel Umesh Sharma, who had purportedly carried out the sting operation in the airport lounge, the officials said.The CBI has slapped Indian Penal Code section pertaining to criminal conspiracy and bribery provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act on the trio.After the video surfaced, the Centre handed over the probe to the CBI.During the preliminary enquiry stage, the CBI had questioned Harish Rawat and Umesh Sharma.",CBI books former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat in horse-trading case,1965,2.086513995

NEW DELHI: With assembly polls less than four weeks away, the debate about giving free electricity , water and other amenities is heating up. East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir said people will stop valuing services if they get it for free. He said the governments must charge a nominal fee to ensure that people use them judiciously.To counter the AAP government’s schemes of free electricity and water to frugal consumers and free ride to women in public transport, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari promised “five times” the benefits being given by the ruling dispensation if elected to power.“If we say that BJP will give five times of what AAP government is giving, I think it is wrong. The AAP government made huge promises of building 500 schools, new hospitals and introducing 5,000 buses, but failed to deliver. We should make only those promises that we can fulfil. Otherwise, it will be a betrayal of people. They will feel cheated and used,” Gambhir said.Accusing the AAP government of “playing” with people’s emotions and betraying them for five years, Gambhir said BJP shouldn’t make the same mistake.The former international cricketer said, “We need to make people capable, not helpless. The AAP government offered free rides to women just three months before election because they are a huge vote bank. If Kejriwal was really concerned, he should have made buses and metro free for students who are short on funds.”The East Delhi MP also accused AAP of politicising the issue of Ghazipur landfill garbage slide and sought cooperation between the corporation and Delhi government to clean the area. He added that he has been at the landfill at least six times, but Kejriwal hasn’t visited the area even once.“It is our collective responsibility to find a solution to the problem. Instead of indulging in blame game, we need to join hands and work towards removing this huge mound of garbage,” Gambhir said.Gambhir said BJP’s top priority would be to provide clean air, potable water and safety and security to women. “Wherever I go in my constituency, people talk about contaminated water and polluted air. We should frame policies keeping in mind the poor who cannot afford air purifiers or RO machines,” he added.Just ahead of his maiden Lok Sabha polls, Gambhir got dragged into a controversy in which he was accused of distributing derogatory pamphlets against Atishi, his rival from AAP. The East Delhi MP has now decided to make this an issue in his public meetings wherein he would be targeting Arvind Kejriwal by asking people if they want a chief minister who doesn’t even respect a woman candidate from his party.Talking to TOI, Gambhir said he was badly hurt and wanted to give up politics after AAP’s allegations. “In desperation to win just one seat, he (Kejriwal) stooped so low. He talks about women’s security, but doesn’t even respect a woman candidate of his own party,” added the cricketer-turned-politician.Gambhir said if AAP was convinced that he distributed the pamphlets, it should have been proven by now. “If the allegation is proved, I will resign as MP. I have a family with two small daughters and would never do such a thing in life,” he added.","Delhi assembly elections: People won’t value services if they are all given for free, says Gautam Gambhir",3349,1.851298895

On the notice board of Jeevandip society—a Slum Redevelopment Authority building in the Kandivali area of suburban Mumbai—there is a handwritten message in Hindi. Loosely translated, it reads: “People of Jeevandip, come to the Sunrise Hall to watch the match. Yadav ji”.

Yadav ji is Omprakash Yadav, father of 19-year-old left-arm spinner Radha Yadav, and the match is the Women’s T20 World Cup final between India and Australia. Yadav has booked a small party hall two blocks away from his building to witness his daughter play in the big final on the big screen along with the others from the building and the locality. A big deal, you’d think, for a 55-year-old man who runs a makeshift grocery-and-vegetable store. But the hall was given in “dosti yaari (friendship)”—for free, that is—while the arrangements of a laptop and a projector were made by the youngsters of the building. That’s how much they all love Radha here. All Yadav had to do was soak in the excitement and keep his store closed for a day.

ALSO READ: ‘Verma ji ki beti’ does Rohtak proud

“It’s a small loss for my daughter’s big day,” he says. And oh, oblige the seemingly umpteen requests for television bites. It ensures the Yadav family misses the first over of the final. In the hall, there are around 75 people; children seated on the floor close to the screen, the others on chairs set in rows. As the Yadavs settle down, Radha is shown on the screen for the first time, fielding the first ball of the second over. Everyone in the hall dishes out a roar in unison. The final is well and truly on, at least for the Yadavs.

“Bahut jyada run de diye (We have given away too many runs),” Yadav says as the score reads 49 after six overs. “They have still kept Gayakwad on,” he tells his elder daughter Soni an over later.

“Radha will bowl around the 10th over,” Soni, 24, replies.

Soni has seen her younger sister evolve from playing under-arm cricket in a nearby ground with their two brothers and the rest of the boys in the area to the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in a span of seven years. “She loved batting back then, but coach Praful Naik spotted something in her bowling. The turning point came when sir took Radha to Baroda in 2016,” she says.

True to Soni’s word, Radha is summoned to bowl in the 10th over. She concedes 12 runs, as Australia’s opening stand goes well past 100. The energy in the hall quickly turns into palpable nervousness.

“Chalo, Radha, wicket nikalo,” yells Soni before the start of her second over. True to her word again, Radha picks up India’s first wicket, sending back Alyssa Healy after a fine knock. People stand up celebrating; Yadav flashes a restrained smile, while Radha’s mother, Amravati, affords a clap with a wider grin. That the wicket might have come a bit late is known to Yadav.

“She bowled a good last over, but we gave away too many runs overall,” says Gufran Salmani, the owner of a nearby salon where Yadav gets his haircuts.

As the final drifts away from India with a flurry of early wickets, so does the excitement inside the hall, with people slowly choosing to leave. Yadav and Amravati are still seated, though, and they do so till the last ball of the match. “This was just her (Radha’s) first examination, there will be many more opportunities,” Yadav says, without a hint of sorrow. “She will continue to become a better cricketer and a human, and so will this young team.”","At Kandivali’s Sunrise Hall, Radha still the local star",3481,2.786555587
3454,0,"The Indian cricket team was in a state of panic after a green tinge was spotted on the Wankhede wicket, the venue for the second Test between India and England. The Indian cricketers’ worst fears were confirmed after close inspection with a magnifying glass revealed a layer of algae, which could potentially make the ball seam and bounce. Fortunately, there were no traces of grass which could have added more ‘carry’.

The boys are yet to come to terms with the state of the pitch. “This is bad news, very bad news indeed. I don’t want to see this wicket anymore,” Dhoni muttered to himself after inspecting the deck. “Does that mean the ball will seam and bounce more than ankle height?” gasped Sehwag, panic written all his face. “Am I expected to bowl on a greentop in India? Is this someone’s idea of a sick joke?” shrieked Ashwin, close to tears, as Zak tried to console him.

Former Test cricketer turned ace commentator, Ravi Shastri, was also livid upon hearing the news. “We wanted a doctored pitch but this is not what the doctored I mean doctor ordered,” he fumed, for once fumbling over his clichés.

While a pall of gloom hangs over the Indian dressing room, news of the microscopic green tinge has buoyed spirits in the English camp. Upon hearing the news, English fast bowler, Jimmy Anderson, crossed himself and thanked the Lord for this miracle. “Take heart, lads. Looks like there might be something in it for us after all,” he cried, in a state of exhilaration.

Pitch curator, Sudhir Naik, has profusely apologized to the Indian team for allowing green life to thrive on the pitch, ordering the groundsmen to double their efforts to destroy these abominable life forms and design the optimal dust-bowl that doesn’t offer any hope to pacers, and takes sharp turn from the second day.

3455,0,"Incensed by Mani Shankar Aiyar’s disparaging remarks about Sports Minister Ajay Maken’s English language skills, and the less-than-polite references to his alma mater Hansraj College, the institute’s Student Union has issued an open challenge to Mani Shankar Aiyar to compete against and beat any Hansraj student of his choice in a spelling bee contest in the public glare of live television.

“Mr. Mani Aiyar Shankar has some nerve to comment that a Hansraj College student cannot possibly know words like dichotononymous (Editor: he meant dichotomous)” exclaimed Lucky, a Hansraj student, angrily waving his fist at this UnReal reporter. “Let him beat us in this contest first and then talk!” he declared, before walking away to join a gang of young women in skirts.

Later in the day, the Hansraj Student Union’s President, Shashank Mahajan, released a rather unintelligible statement to the media. Reading slowly from a note, he said, “We pertinaciously fustigate Shri Mani Shankar Aiyar’s calumnious expositions about Hansraj College and resolutely believe that they were uttered in a state of discombobulation. Further, we… er,” before proceeding to distribute copies for the press to read and grasp the rest of the statement.

The contest, as understood, is expected to follow a pattern similar to America’s Scripps Spelling Bee contest, with a combination of written and oral rounds where contestants would be expected to spell out esoteric English words and explain their meaning and usage. Hansraj students have reportedly answered the Student President’s call with gutso, and have set about preparations on a war footing. Students are seen playing Scrabble instead of CounterStrike in their dorm rooms. Lovers are seen referring to a mini Oxford dictionary before they mutter indecipherable sweet nothings to each other.

Interestingly, Mani Shankar Aiyar has taken this challenge head on. When The UnReal Times asked him what he thought about his chances, he gruffly replied “Nonsense! These Chetan Bhagat readers can never hope to beat me. You know what I do after waking up every day? I read Hamlet. You know what I do every night before I go to bed? I speak to Shashi Tharoor. Beat me in English? Hmph! In your dreams, brother!”

The development, however, has brought a huge cheer in the Congress camp, with several prominent leaders heaving a sigh of relief at the unexpected bonus. “Phew! This will keep him busy for a while and spare us his attacks!” remarked a Cabinet Minister from the Congress.","Angered by remarks, Hansraj College students challenge Mani Shankar Aiyar to a spelling bee contest",2515,2.107355865

However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her.

3458,0,"Mumbai. Shardul Thakur played a blinder to win the third ODI for India. But one thing that remained constant in this match was Kedar Jadhav’s performance. Kedar looked totally out of sorts and the selectors are somehow not being able to drop him.

Finally MSK Prasad has decided to take help of Rishabh Pant, who as they say is the expert at dropping. Rishabh dropped 4 catches in yesterday’s match and he is also known for his miss stumpings.

The selectors had a long meeting with Pant where the wicket keeper batsman explained tham the right technique of dropping. MSK Prasad who himself is a famous mediocre wicket keeper learnt the trick very fast and wants to implement it soon in the next series.

Kedar has the confidence of Shastri and Kohli and hence the selectors were always skeptical of his dropping.

Salman at a promotional event for his new Being Human Soft Drink

Sources say that contrary to what was reported in the media, the separation between the actor and the soft drink company was anything but mutual.

“Bhai’s ego was hurt by the manner in which the company dropped him as the face for their soft drink. The brand manager just sent a watsapp message and said it was over. So an angry bhai wanted to teach the company a lesson,” said a source close to the actor.

“This is bhai’s way of expressing his anger. If he doesn’t get anything he starts his own ‘Being Human thing’. In fact Being Human clothing started after bhai ko dukan me unke size ke kapde nahi mile,” the source added.

Apparently, Salman will embark on a marketing spree for his soft drink this festival season to hurt the market share of Thums Up and teach the company a lesson.

“His new drink will have him raising the ‘index finger’ as a counter to the erect thumb sign of Thums Up with the tagline ‘ungli mat karna’. The TVC is slated to go live just before Diwali,” said an executive handling the creative duties of Being Human soft drink.

Coca-Cola, which own the brand Thums Up, has said that it is geared for any challenges and has upped its marketing spend to take Salman head on.

With the poaching case surrounding the actor resurfacing things are not looking bright for Salman this Diwali.

The special task force named SDPG (Sheila’s Daughter Protection Group), not to be confused with the other SDPG (Sonia’s Damaad Protection Group) will consist of the best officers of Delhi Police and will provide 24 X 7 protection to Latika Dixit Syed, Sheila Ji’s daughter. The task force comprising of 1,000 policemen will accompany Latika Dixit Syed wherever she goes.

Sheila Dixit refused to comment over the development as she talks only to a few media houses

Speaking to Faking News, a Delhi police official said, “It is a matter of great shame for us that we can’t even make the daughter of the Chief Minister feel secure. We wish Sheila Ji had told us this in private instead of embarrassing us on national TV. Now, we have taken a pledge that we won’t rest till we ensure safety and security for Latika ji.”

“Initially we thought about hiring Salman Khan as her bodyguard but he said he doesn’t have any free time as he is busy shooting films and preparing for court appearances so he can not commit to this assignment. That is when we decided to form a special task force from our own staff. List of officers hasn’t been finalized yet as we need to find 1,000 policemen who can live without hafta as we don’t expect to get any money from the Dixits. The 1,000 crore rupees earmarked under Nirbhaya fund isn’t enough for everyone to make money. Wish FM had allocated 1 Lakh crores for women safety,” he added.

When we asked the official whether devoting such a large number of officers to protect one person will lead to an even more insecure environment for women in Delhi due to the lack of police force for general public, he answered, “Delhi girls are brave-hearts and women of courage, why do they need protection? We need to protect the meek, not the courageous. Even in case something happens to them, their relatives get money, government jobs and flats in Delhi, I think they are better off unprotected.”

Meanwhile, a little surprisingly, some Delhi citizens we interviewed welcomed this move, a Delhi University student Sonia said, “Why just 1000, can’t they send every cop and his friend to protect Sheila ji and her family?

Harmanpreet Kaur said that Shafali Verma struggled to bounce back after dropping Alyssa Healy but refused to blame the teenager for defeat in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final.

India, playing in their first Women’s T20 World Cup Final, had no answer to Alyssa Healy (75) and Beth Mooney (78 not out) before folding to 99 all out at the hands of seamer Megan Schutt and spinner Jess Jonassen.

Shafali, who ends with the highest strike rate of any batter to face more than 50 balls at the event, dropped Healy on nine in the first over and only made two in the reply.

But this setback will only serve as a learning experience in the eyes of the India captain.

“She’s only 16, she’s playing her first World Cup. She did really, really well and performed for us,” said Kaur. “For a 16-year-old kid, it’s difficult to keep thinking positively and stay in the game.

“It’s a learning lesson for her but it could happen to anyone. We can’t blame her because there were others also in her position.

“We gave chances to batters in great form and it’s difficult for bowlers to come back when that happens.

“We weren’t feeling under pressure but unfortunately we were unable to create those chances.

“It’s a lesson for all of us, we have to be at 100 per cent when we’re fielding because that’s the most important part of cricket.”

India came into the tournament with one of its youngest squads, and became the first team to field more than one teenager in the tournament’s Final.

It’s a youthful energy that bodes well for the future for Kaur’s side, with plenty of new faces since their ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 defeat to England.

On that occasion, just nine runs separated India from the title - with the lack of clinical cricket this time around making defeat slightly easier to swallow for the skipper.

“I guess 2017 was more disappointing, because that was so close,” she added. “We didn’t play the cricket we expected of ourselves this time.

“As our team is quite young, we did really well in the league games. We reached the semis and the Final this year. If we keep working and improving, maybe in the future we can win.

“There was still excitement. It was a great day, we definitely enjoyed it. Winning and losing is part of the game, one team has to do both. At the end of the day, it was a great moment for us.

“We didn’t field well, we need to learn from today’s performance. When you are playing a great level of cricket, you cannot drop the chances and we were not up to the mark.

“We will take this seriously and when we come to play next time, we will be one of the best fielding sides.”",‘She’s only 16’: Harmanpreet Kaur backs Shafali Verma after Women’s T20 World Cup loss,2826,2.300070771

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country.",2 PFI members arrested for Delhi violence; 1 of them had fought Assembly polls,2079,1.875901876
3463,0,"In the biggest blow to AAP’s electoral prospects, Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit said she is not averse to a post poll tie up with the fledgling anti-corruption party to ‘keep communal forces at bay’, thereby sowing seeds of panic in the AAP camp. Even Yogendra Yadav’s latest internal survey indicating a thumping win for AAP did little to lift Kejriwal’s mood in the wake of Sheila’s overtures. The statement has strengthened the perception that voting for AAP is an indirect vote for the Congress and sullied AAP’s chances at the hustings.

As soon as Dikshit’s statement was reported by the press, a worried Kejriwal attempted damage control, dubbing Congress a B-team of the BJP and alleging that Sheila may have made those insidious remarks at the behest of BJP leaders. “Yaar, please come out with more doctored CDs, rake up charges such as having multiple Voter Id cards or unpaid traffic violation fines, but please don’t hint that AAP may end up in bed with Congress after the elections,” was Kejriwal’s plaintive appeal.

He also assured his base that he will not use that dreaded phrase ‘keeping communal forces at bay’ and end up allying with the Congress in the event of a hung assembly. The Magsasay award winner however conceded that it would really suck if Congress came back to power because of AAP cutting into the anti-incumbency vote. “Yeah, that’s a really depressing scenario. That’s why people should either completely switch to the BJP or completely to AAP,” he noted.

Both BJP and Congress, however, denied that they are working in tandem to hurt AAP. Jointly addressing the press, Dr. Harshavardhan and Sheila said that if they really wanted to hurt the credibility of AAP, they would have got Sharad Pawar to endorse Arvind Kejriwal.

In doing so, the triple centurion has also managed to inspire veteran journalist Rajdeep Sardesai to do the same in the middle of his TV debates.

Rajdeep, who takes to Twitter every night to post classic Hindi songs with a “song for the night” tweet, extended his habit to TV too, thanks to Sehwag.

“I have, so far, tried many ways to trounce Arnab, but in vain. Be it the sense over sensationalism, news over noise ads when I was at CNN-IBN or our election coverage at India Today, I just haven’t been able to beat him. I’m not talking in the literal sense, by the way. Literally speaking, I can effortlessly beat anyone up, people on the streets of New York can vouch for that,” Rajdeep told The UnReal Times.

“So yes, while I was still scratching my head for ideas, I happened to see a carefree Viru humming songs while blasting bowlers left and right on Cricket All Stars. That was my moment of reckoning – I remembered that while most people hate everything about me on Twitter, my choice of gnight songs is something no one hates. So I decided to do a Viru and when Sambit Patra and Sanjay Jha had a go at each other in yesterday’s debate, I started humming Dekho Dekho yeh hai jalwa. The feedback I got after the show was mind-blowing. Even the Modi bhakts and trolls told me they loved my humming and wanted me to do more of those. For the first time, I feel confident of defeating Arnab. Melody over madness, folks!” the India Today anchor added.

At an interview recorded today, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rajdeep mentioned that he began to hum So Jaa Rajkumari when Dr.Singh was speaking. At a news report of PM Modi’s trip to Turkey, Rajdeep added that he sang Hawa Hawai.

Arnab, however, added that he was unfazed by Rajdeep’s latest tactic. “This is the age of rap, dubstep etc. Basically, its the age of anything but melody. If at all it gets to a stage where my viewership takes a jolt, I can always scream out some metallica and iron maiden songs and head bang.

As the rather public spat between two Congress stalwarts – Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee – snowballed into a crisis for the UPA government, Soniaji stepped in, as she often does, to bring closure to the issue.

Hours before Chidambaram and Pranabda declared to the media that the ‘issue was officially closed’, Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee are seen sitting in Sonia Gandhi’s room, looking rather agitated, even as a patient Sonia Gandhi attempts to calm them down.

Chidambaram (agitatedly): Soniaji, ask him why did he write that letter saying nasty things about me!

Pranab (indignantly): Soniaji, ashk him why did he bog my offish!

Chidambaram: Soniaji, this is not fair. I wrote “I won’t bug Pranabda’s office” 1000 times like you asked me to. The matter was closed then. He cannot carry a grudge and take revenge like this.

Pranab (throws up his hands): Beeg deal. I will olso write “I wont write nashty things about Lungi Anna” 1000 times.

Chidambaram (turns to Pranab angrily): Hey, who the hell are you calling Lungi Anna?

Pranab (sneers): You, who elsh, Lungi Anna Lungi Anna Lungi Anna!

The two square off and start slapping each other’s hands like little girls.

Sonia (interrupts): Guys, guys. Come on. If I wanted to play kindergarten teacher, I would rather call Rahul. At least he’s adorable. Behave, guys.

The two stop squabbling and sit down with glum expressions.

Sonia: Okay, look. Both of you are equally important to me, guys. You two are like Sherlock Holmes and Watson. Brave, resourceful and brilliant.

Chidambaram (to Pranab): You see that? She means I, as the Home Minister, am Sherlock Holmes, and you are my sidekick Watson.

Sonia: (just as Pranab turns to her indignantly) Err… thats not quite right. Lets say you are my Batman and Robin.

Pranab (to Chidambaram): You see that? I wear black. So she calls me Batman.

Chidambaram: Thats rubbish. Robin is much shorter. You are Robin, you chintu fellow.

Pranab (frustrated): Soniaji, dish won’t work. You have to choosh charactersh that are equal.

Sonia: Umm. I see your point. Okay, how about this? Manmohanji can be Shrek and you two can be Donkey and Puss-in-boots.

Pranab: Obviously, I am Push-in-bootsh, as lungi doesn’t wear boots. He doesn’t even wear pants! Ha ha ha (laughs uproariously)

Incensed, Chidambaram jumps on Pranabda, and the two start scrapping again.

At that moment Rahul Gandhi comes in, looking quite upset. He flings his blackberry in one direction, his man purse in the other direction and flops onto the sofa with a heavy sigh.

Sonia: What happened, beta?

Rahul (in a whining tone): Mamma, Diggy chacha just sent me an SMS that he is resigning from the post of my mentor. Now who will be my side kick in my padyatras? He is not even picking my calls!

Sonia: Oh… my poor baby. Don’t worry, Mamma will find you a new mentor

Rahul: Yeah. And I want two of them this time. I think it would look better on TV if two bigshots walk slightly behind me on either side during my padyatras… just like in Rajnikant movies.

Sonia (exhaling slowly): Hmm. Let me think.

Sonia slowly lowers her gaze from Rahul to the floor, as she ponders over what Rahul just said. A second later, she tilts her gaze sideways to look at Chidambaram and Pranab. Chidambaram’s and Pranab’s eyes widen, and their faces take on expressions of absolute terror. Panic-striken, they look at each other and then back at Sonia Gandhi.

Chidambaram (hastily): We are good. No issues between us.

Pranab (almost at the same time): Yeah, Chiddu is my best friend.

Sonia: Good. Now shake. (The two ministers immediately shake hands). Hug. (The two ministers immediately hug). Good. You can go.

Chidambaram and Pranabda put their arms around each other’s shoulders, sing Airtel’s ‘Aakhir har ek friend zaroori hota hai’ and walk away from the room.

3469,0,"It is reliably learnt that BCCI, the governing body of cricket in India, has agreed to completely abide by the ICC backed Decision Review System, which includes use of ball tracking, snickometer and hotspot to eliminate human error in judging appeals. In addition, the world’s richest cricketing body has also agreed to foot the bill for deploying these cutting edge technologies for the first three years during international fixtures.

In return, the BCCI expects the ICC to amend the laws relating to the simplest mode of dismissal of a batsman – that of being ‘clean bowled’. The changes to the law include:

* Any right handed opening batsman with more than 2 triple centuries in Test cricket and 1 double century in ODIs, will not be deemed out clean-bowled, unless the stumps are uprooted. The existing law says that it is enough if the bails are disturbed. Going forward, mere dislodging of bails will not be sufficient. At least one stump has to be uprooted.

* Any batsman, who has scored more than 100 international centuries will not be given out bowled, unless both off-stump and leg stump are uprooted at the same time. In essence, the middle stump and bails are being taken out of the equation. The laws applicable to middle stump will be similar to what happens during a free hit in ODIs. Even if the middle stump is uprooted, batsman can take runs and this will be added to the total. In addition, any bowler, who disturbs the middle stump of the said batsman two times or more during an innings, will be disqualified from bowling in the match again.

The ICC President, Mr. Alan Isaac, said his organization will be more than happy to incorporate these changes requested by the BCCI to reset balance in the game between bat and bowl and make it more of an even contest. He wistfully added that had these laws been amended earlier, many a great batsman would have extended their careers by a few more years, if not decades, and many a batting record, including one pertaining to the highest average in Test cricket that came agonizingly close to breaking the 100 runs/per innings barrier, would have been reset.

Other cricketing boards have also submitted their wish-list of reforms to strengthen the foundations of the gentleman’s game. The Australians want to outlaw LBW decisions against batsman with over 40 Test match hundreds. The Pakistan cricket board wants to do away with the cumbersome practice of displaying a cricketer’s age as it takes the focus away from the game itself.

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front.","In Rajinikanth’s big plan for Tamil Nadu politics, he won’t be the CM face",2180,2.064220183

Opener Liton Das maintained his superb form as Bangladesh thrashed Zimbabwe by nine wickets in the second Twenty20 international to clinch the two-match series 2-0 in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Liton hit an unbeaten 60 off 45 balls, his second fifty on the trot, which followed two brilliant centuries in the preceding one-day international series, as Bangladesh reached 120-1 in 15.5 overs after restricting Zimbabwe to 119-7.

Chasing a modest target, Liton struck eight fours as he took the excitement out of the game in a 77-run opening stand.

Naim, who replaced the rested Tamim Iqbal, made 33 runs before he became the only batsman to be dismissed in Bangladesh’s innings as Tinashe Kamunhukamwe took the catch off Chris Mpofu at mid-wicket.

Soumya Sarkar remained unbeaten on 20 and finished the game off alongside Liton with a single from Mpofu as Bangladesh reached their target with 25 balls to spare.

Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad heaped praise on Liton for his consistent performance throughout the series.

“The way we played is pleasing to see. Especially Liton has batted outstandingly well. It shows his maturity and hunger,” he said.

Former skipper Brendan Taylor earlier hit an unbeaten 59 off 48 balls with six fours and a six to give Zimbabwe innings some respectability.

Taylor posted 57 runs with Craig Ervine, who made 29, for the second wicket but the Bangladesh bowlers maintained a tight line to put Zimbabwe under pressure.

Al-Amin Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman claimed 2-22 and 2-25 respectively for Bangladesh.

Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams urged his teammates “to stay positive.”

“Things happen quickly in T20 cricket. It’s just not happening for us at the moment. (We) need to reflect on ourselves,” Williams said.

For developed countries, the economy has always been the fulcrum of politics. In India, “voters do not cast their vote, but they vote their caste” is a popular saying. The 2019 elections have introduced a new narrative — good economics is good politics through social empowerment.

Putting the citizen first is the guiding principle of good governance. It is this ideology that brings stakeholders, the government and the citizens closer to each other. Good governance is the key to a country’s prosperity and progress. For this to happen, it is important that the citizens become active participants in governance. Swachh Bharat is a textbook example.

The redressal of public grievances assures the citizens that their vote has not gone wasted. Technology is an important tool for good governance as it ensures transparency and accountability which result in the betterment and welfare of all citizens. It also leads to the simplification of processes. The best example is the self-certification of startups introduced by the Narendra Modi government, exhibiting trust in their citizens. Digital India ensures that government services are available to the citizen with little human interference.

These features of good governance were the hallmark of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance-I government. Social empowerment, which came through good economics, is now good politics.

Voters choose a stable government with a strong, decisive leadership. Now, development has become the buzzword. With the coming of age of social media, people can make more informed choices in many areas. Understanding this, Modi has mastered the skill of optimising social media as a tool to connect with the people.

For the first time, we are seeing a government that is determined to improve the socioeconomic status of the people. Niti Aayog selected 100 districts and called them Aspirational Districts, focusing on health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development. These core areas have a direct bearing on the quality of life and the economic productivity of citizens. The prime minister himself, along with the Niti Aayog, monitors the outcomes on a continuous basis with the state governments.

In Uttar Pradesh, eight backward districts have been selected as aspirational: Balrampur, Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharth Nagar, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. They are already showing positive results. Such microplanning has never been seen in Indian political governance. Known popularly as the “Modi Development Model”, it was adopted by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath. A state once known for bad roads, negligible electricity, the lack of doctors and teachers, farmers burdened with loans, and poor law and order, has turned around by adopting good economics with good politics. Within a year, the Adityanath government had received proposals worth Rs 4.68 lakh crore. Uttar Pradesh is gradually becoming the favourite stop for investors in India.

The new narrative for political parties has become development. The focus of voters is now performance and the economy has become an undisputable way to indicate growth and success. The electorate feels a direct connect to something tangible. The 2019 elections have given a new dimension to the phrase, good economics is good politics, but via social empowerment.

The septuagenarian posed for the selfie by plastering a child-like grin on his face against the backdrop of thousands of downcast supporters. The veteran Gandhian immediately posted the selfie on Instagram and Facebook , tagging the entire nation and broadcasting the following message:

This is the impish face of revolution #passjanlokpal

The selfie has injected a dash of irreverence to an otherwise grim situation in which the social leader has placed his life on the line to exert moral pressure on the body-politic to excise the tumour of corruption that threatens to consume it. On receiving a few likes, Anna’s aides boasted that his selfie was much more popular than Kejriwal’s political campaign photographs. The news of Anna’s selfie made it to page three of some publications, thereby generating much needed publicity for the anti-corruption movement.

While Kejriwal has so far borne his mentor’s cussedness with forbearance, he now seems to have given up on Anna. Kejriwal used the oldest trick in the school boy’s book, sneakily dipping his thermometer in hot milk to avoid meeting his estranged mentor.

Meanwhile in Ralegan Siddhi, the veteran Gandhi stood naively on the stage, his giant portrait in the background dwarfing his own self. However the spark of teenage rebellion continues to burn as strongly as did the candles at Jantar Mantar. Anna has continued to insist on legislating on the street while steadfastly maintained his self-righteous refusal to participate in the political process that he hopes to influence.

When the media did finally come around to cover the event for page four, Anna insisted that it was the front page or nothing. He adamantly maintained that the Jan media would have done it differently. Jan Media would plaster the event over the entire first page leaving no room for other events.

If there were any perceptions about the threat of coronavirus in the city, its cricket fans certainly didn’t show it. Mumbaikars thronged to the Wankhede Stadium in numbers to relive some of their golden memories of watching the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Brian Lara and Yuvraj Singh in action.

There were doubts about the response to the initiative of gathering veterans to play a tournament at a time when the world is reeling from the fast-spreading virus. However, to the amazement of all the players, a packed Wankhede greeted the India and West Indies legends on Saturday night.

Playing to promote the ‘Road Safety Week’, both teams were studded with some big names. But, most of all, the crowd had turned up to watch Lara and Tendulkar turn back the clock. Much to their delight, the two best batsmen of their era didn’t disappoint.

West Indies Legends batted first and Lara set the tone with two extravagant lofted drives off Zaheer Khan. At the score of 17, he was out, stumped by keeper Sameer Dighe off Irfan Pathan, but he had given the crowd what they had come to see with four beautifully timed fours.

When India’s turn came to bat, chasing 151, Tendulkar came up with the perfect response to the Caribbean master’s cameo, treating his home crowd to his trademark strokes all around the wicket en route to a 29-ball 36.

To add to the fun, Tendulkar’s opening partner, Sehwag, also showed glimpses of his former self during a typically destructive 57-ball unbeaten 74 to power the home team to a seven-wicket win. Tendulkar and Sehwag’s entry into the ground was greeted with a thunderous applause and Sehwag livened up the proceedings by smashing the first two balls of the innings for fours, the second a glorious front foot cover drive on a bent knee.","Road Safety World Series 2020: What coronavirus?

Former skipper Faf du Plessis’ long experience of playing in IPL and international cricket in India will come in handy during the upcoming three-match ODI series, feels South Africa head coach Mark Boucher. The series starts in Dharamsala on February 12. Du Plessis, who last played an ODI during the 2019 World Cup, had an indifferent T20 series against Australia, with scores of 24, 15 and 5. “If you go to a place like India, you need to find a balance between youth and experience. I think Faf is really doing well in ODI cricket for South Africa. The last time he played, he got a hundred. He knows the Indian conditions very well,” Boucher said during the team’s pre-departure press conference on Sunday.

The South African team reached India on Monday morning and will take a chartered flight to Dharamsala on Tuesday. Boucher feels that having Du Plessis also means he will have some selection headaches, which is a good thing to have.

“It’s a good headache to have. Just him being around the squad will add a lot of value and experience as well. We will look at conditions and then put together combinations. Why you would want to have Faf is because he has done really well in those (Indian) conditions.”

While South Africa lost the T20 series 1-2 to Australia, they blanked the visitors 3-0 in the ODIs, which gives them confidence going into the series against India. “T20s are important this year given we have the T20 World Cup. But in general, Proteas and Cricket South Africa (CSA), we need to find ourselves growing.

“We have just beaten a very good team now. We needed confidence and it will certainly give us a lot of confidence.” The former wicketkeeper said that Indian conditions will be tough for a lot of visiting players, who will be touring the country for the first time.

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

3481,0,"Social networking giant Facebook, which has come up with new features that help its users to help deal with breakups by regulating their interactions with their exes, among many other things, has sought help from the BJP and the Shiv Sena to conduct what they think would be a comprehensive testing of the features.

“Well, it’s quite obvious that today, every time, a break up happens somewhere in the world even before you can finish saying the word break up. It has been observed that a lot of people do inane things on Facebook in the process of trying to get over their exes – be it stalking, or blocking them, or posting nasty stuff and so on. We’ve seen many cases of bizarre behavior. So we decided to come up with some features to sort of regulate this process of our users trying to get over their failed relationships. We’ve done our fair share of testing but I don’t quite think that it’s rigorous enough. To get it comprehensively tested, we needed a couple that keeps breaking up and reuniting at regular intervals and who better than India’s BJP and Shiv Sena to do that?” Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg told The UnReal Times correspondent Mark Zuckerpandian.

“The idea was suggested to us by none other than PM Narendra Modi. He was the one who gave us a lot of new test cases which were hitherto unthought of – for example, the Shiv Sena breaks up with the BJP and reunites even before it is fully able to dissociate itself from the hangover of the relationship. The Shiv Sena threatens to break up again and the BJP doesn’t give a damn. It announces that it will announce its breakup soon, but then the next day, Sena chief Uddhav is seen hugging CM Fadnavis at a function. Whew! This is the most unpredictable relationship I’ve ever seen and it’s that nature of this relationship that makes it the ideal testbed for our features,” Zuckerberg added. The Facebook founder also mentioned that he had sought opinions from Bollywood director duo Abbas Mastaan, who told him that even they couldn’t come up with such unpredictable twists in their Race movies.

And that’s not all – Physicist Kip Thorne of Interstellar fame also corroborated Zuckerberg’s claims, asserting that all applications of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle on this relationship are in vain. While the BJP and PM Modi are gung ho about their new partnership with Facebook, the Shiv Sena has replied in the negative.

“Who is the BJP to go to Facebook and hit the like button for this partnership on our behalf? If Zuckerberg wants us to help, I am sitting right here at Matoshree. He can come here and talk to me and we will discuss. We have several conditions upfront – there should be Marathis and no Biharis working on these features, these features should not be usable by Pakistanis and so on and so forth. If they are not met, we will hesitate no further and break up with the BJP,” Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray thundered.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena NCP spokesperson Rahul Narvekar reached out to Zuckerberg, declaring that he could be of good help in testing the features and that he has the right qualifications for such a purpose.",Facebook seeks BJP’s and Shiv Sena’s help in testing its new “post relationship breakup” features,3124,1.440460948
3482,0,"After Congress President Sonia Gandhi directed heir apparent Rahul Gandhi to play a greater role in Andhra Pradesh affairs, the Nehru-Gandhi scion has decided to focus his energies entirely on this important southern state, which holds the key to the Congress recapturing power at the Center.

“Dude, I am giving up on UP. Way too much population, way too many castes, and way too competitive. AP, my aides tell me, is easier to crack,” said Rahul, who has gone in for a complete image makeover to come across as a genuine Telugu bidda.

This includes changing his name to ‘Rao-lo Gandhilu’, so that Andhra people can better identify with him and a tonsured scalp, courtesy a visit to the temple town of Tirupati, where the Nehru Gandhi scion sought Lord Balaji’s blessings to revive his sagging political fortunes. “You see, the lesson we learnt from the UP debacle was that facile image makeovers like sporting a beard or tearing up electoral manifestos of opponents need to be augmented by more convincing theatrical interventions,” informed a close aide.

There was pressure to change his name to Rahul Reddy or Rahul Naidu but Gandhilu wisely chose not to convey any caste affiliation with his new moniker and thereby remain above the fray of petty caste politics.

Gandhilu said that he would continue with his time tested policy of visiting the downtrodden, and spending time with them over lunch and dinner to try and understand their problems. In an attempt to prove his point, he visited actor Ram Charan Teja, after hearing about his recent movie “Racha”, which is reported to be moving towards disaster at the box office. The grapevine also has it that the Congress leader would be visiting the struggling IPL team Deccan Chargers’ star player Daniel Christian, which should also reaffirm his party’s secular credentials.

Gandhilu kick-started his campaign by addressing a gathering at Ramoji Film City, in which he sought to convince film producers & actors about the benefits of FDI. Gandhilu observed that courtesy his Government’s FDI policy, international film houses would be able to invest in Tollywood and more importantly, Telugu movies would feature buxom Hollywood stars like Kate Winslet in item numbers and even full-fledged roles. “Why should Tollywood only import Katrina and Kareena for item numbers and itsy bitsy roles? Andhra people will now be able to enjoy the word’s leading voluptuous babes cavorting with mega stars like Chiru and speaking in chaste Telugu,” thundered Gandhilu, to a hearty round of applause.

However, Tollywood superstar, “Prince” Mahesh Babu, who was also present, retorted, “Re Gandhilu, Tirupati ke laddoo na raa?” perhaps to remind everyone who AP’s real prince is.

When asked when he would take over the party’s affairs in the state, Gandhilu replied with a wide grin, “Rape chestaanu” (will do it tomorrow), much to the shock of BJP leader Shushma Swaraj, who rebuked Gandhilu for lowering the level of political discourse. “There is a limit to rhetoric. How can Rahul ji stoop to such levels. We demand a clarification of why he used such unparliamentary language,” said the BJP leader.

Rahulo Gandhilu responded to this misdirected and misinformed attack with aplomb by saying “Light theesko, ma.”

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Also Watch l How Jyotiraditya Scindia’s induction will help the BJP

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Also read: What may have triggered Jyotiraditya Scindia to quit Congress

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party.","As Congress scrambles to save MP govt, buzz grows of internal rift in BJP",3065,1.827079935

It’ll be summer soon, and that means it’s time to start exploring fellowships, volunteer programmes, internships, maybe even start-ups. Added to the long list of options, as students try to expand their horizons and make their CVs more impressive, are the spaces of culture, heritage and urban studies.

Organisations operating in these spaces are responding with programmes for undergraduate and postgraduate students, and they say applications have already started coming in.

The work typically involves conducting surveys and research for white papers, assisting in urban planning projects, organising events and even engaging with the public at events, walks and trails.

Organisations in Mumbai to aim for include the Godrej India Culture Lab, Khaki Heritage Foundation, and the globally run Young Leaders for Active Citizenship (YLAC).

Exchange of ideas

The Culture Lab in Mumbai has a national fellowship programme and invites undergraduates, postgraduates and PhD students to apply for its two-month, full-time opportunity. Since the Lab’s focus is on urban-rural narratives, digital India, educational alternatives, dissent frameworks, environmental policies, and identity politics, students from any discipline who are working in or at the intersection of such themes are welcome to apply.

Selected fellows will assist in organising events, conducting research and producing white papers. The programmes are held in June-July or July-August, depending on the candidate’s academic schedule, and students are required to work 40 hours a week.

“The fellowship will take students beyond academics and push them to think in ways that come from a multidisciplinary approach,” says Koninika Roy, catalyst at India Culture Lab. “Since the India Culture Lab is all about a cross-pollination of ideas, students will get to learn a great deal by interacting with experts, working on the thesis for their own college projects (if any) and showcasing their work to a wider audience.” All fellows are paid a stipend.

Policy-making

For students in Classes 11 and 12, set to begin senior college, YLAC, which focuses on transforming learning systems and preparing younger generations to lead change, conducts a High School Achievers’ Programme every summer. Two modules are available — one with a focus on developing critical thinking through debates in political science, sociological concepts, philosophy and economics; the other with a focus on collaborating with NGOs, going on field visits, engaging with local communities and using academic skills to document and address social issues. The three-week programme is held in May in Bengaluru and in June in Mumbai and Delhi.

For college students interested in policymaking and politics, there is a month-long programme called Policy in Action, held across Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi and focused on developing core skills of advocacy and policy analysis. Students work closely on live projects with Members of the Parliament (MPs), who are invited as guest faculty. The sessions are conducted over the weekends and students work on projects remotely.

All fellowships require students to pay, but scholarships are available.

Siddhaarth Sudhakarna, 25, a senior product analyst, had enrolled in the Policy in Action fellowship last year. “I wanted to learn from the people actually working on national policies. We were all assigned to an MP or a planning agency to work on a topic. I was given a policy brief on judicial reform and how the system can be made more effective,” he says. As a software engineer he had no clue how to proceed. “But we had a team member who was a lawyer and guided us with questions and how to formulate them. The YLAC team also helped a lot, offering domain expertise. There’s so much about the Indian system that we should know as citizens, but we don’t,” Sudhakarna adds.

Know your city

For those interested in culture, heritage and culinary history, Khaki Lab by the Khaki Heritage Foundation has opportunities this summer for college students. “We have film screenings, food trails and panel discussions coming up and we would like college students to collaborate with us to organise these events and in the process, learn about the city’s forgotten history,” says founder Bharat Gothoskar.

Alisha Sadikot, a city historian and founder of the Inheritage Project, has two final year tourism students from Ruia college interning with her for the coming four months. “I have worked with their class before to do workshops and walking tours and that led to this internship opportunity. They had to intern, as part of their degree programme, with an agency in their field. The students will work with me and assist in my programmes and also develop one individual project idea of their own,” Sadikot says. “They will explore the wider fields of public history, urban heritage and engagement as part of their degree in travel and tourism, with a view to also exploring evolving employment opportunities in the field.",Make your summer count.

MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray 's son Aaditya, the first elected representative from the Thackeray family, may act as the 'shadow CM' instead of being part of the cabinet led by his father, sources said.A Sena functionary said that two persons from the same family occupying cabinet berths could affect the image of the party, so Aaditya may not take up a cabinet position though he will be very much a part of the top team in the party and in the Sena-led government. Keeping Aaditya away from the cabinet could also be beneficial from the party point of view, the functionary said, as the 29-year-old Thackeray scion could facilitate talks and solve issues at the organisation level. He could also visit various districts to interact with the party cadre across the state, said the functionary.Aaditya was elected from the Worli constituency and took oath as a debutant legislator along with other MLAs at Vidhan Bhavan on Wednesday.Apart from Eknath Shinde, who will be sworn in today, contenders for ministerial posts from the Sena include MLAs Sanjay Rathod and Ashish Jaiswal from Vidarbha, Dada Bhuse and Tanaji Sawant from Marathwada, Gulabrao Patil and Dadaji Bhuse from North Maharashtra, Shambhuraj Desai and Prakash Abitkar from Western Maharashtra, Pratap Sarnaik (in addition to Shinde) from the Thane-Palghar belt.Other contenders are Anil Parab, Ravindra Waikar and Diwakar Raote from Mumbai.In Video: Will provide stable government to Maharashtra: Aaditya Thackeray","Aaditya Thackeray may not get cabinet berth, but will be in top team as 'shadow CM'",1697,2.180318209

The film will be a sequel to the smash hit Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, the 2001 film directed by Mr. Johar.

As per sources, the scene of Thanos crying in the film instantly reminded Karan Johar of his own films and he started thinking how he can adapt the script for Bollywood audience.

Confirming the news, an employee of Dharma Productions said, “Karan Sir has produced remake of a Hindi film, Agneepath, now producing remake of a Marathi film, Sairat, so now he wanted to go international and produce a remake of a Hollywood film. Since it is a very ambitious project, he has decided to direct this one as well. For a long time, he was searching for the right script for the sequel of K3G as well and the family drama in Infinity War struck the right chord.”

“I can’t give out too many details but the film will focus on the family drama in Thanos household. The dynamics between Thanos, Gamora and Nebula will be showcased in the film. Fans of the original K3G will be able to relate to the film instantly with Thanos being similar to Bachchan Sir, Gamora similar to SRK and Nebula being Hrithik Roshan.

Inflation is back on the economic agenda. The annual growth in wholesale price index (WPI) in the quarter ending September 2018 was 4.98%.

This is the highest since September 2014, which was the first full quarter after the current government assumed office. To be sure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 3.88% in this period, after having grown at more than 4% in the last three quarters.

Both CPI and WPI have been rising

The political context is important here. Inflation was rising at a fast pace — CPI was growing in double digits — before the 2014 general elections. The current trajectory of crude oil prices and rupee’s exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar, both of which affect inflation, is also similar to the pre-2014 trajectory.

However, there is one key difference in the rising inflation under the present government and its predecessor.

Rising inflation under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) II came on the back of high food prices; this has not been the case under the present government. Chart 2 shows the annual growth in food and non-food component of the CPI and the primary food articles component of the WPI.

Until March 2014, both CPI-Food and WPI-primary food article components were growing at a faster pace than the non-food component of the CPI.

The WPI-primary food component is a useful proxy for growth in prices received by the farmers, as they sell their output in wholesale, not retail markets.

Its growth has been falling at a faster pace than that of the CPI-food component in the recent period.

UPA II inflation was driven by food prices

This trend has important political economy implications. A relatively slower growth in food prices, especially in farm products means a worsening of terms of trade for farmers.

This corroborates the narrative of rural distress under the present government.

But it also means that net buyers of food grains, even if they are not so well-off, are not hit hard by inflation. Exorbitant prices of pulses and vegetables were an important part of the economic narrative in the last phase of the UPA-II government. This is not the case right now.

These trends can have political implications.

Successive rounds of the Mood of the Nation survey conducted by Delhi based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies-Lokniti show a marked difference in changing levels of support for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in villages and big cities.

Support for the NDA went down by nine percentage points between May 2017 and May 2018 in villages, while it increased by two percentage points in the big cities. Things could have been different had the urban poor been hit hard by rising food prices.

BJP has bigger support in cities

So, is keeping food inflation in control a political masterstroke by the present government? Another set of statistics could help put this question in context. A 2014 paper by Rahul Verma and Sanjay Kumar compared the gains in BJP’s vote share and seats in rural, semi-urban and urban areas between the 2009 and 2014 elections. The biggest increase in vote share for the BJP was in urban areas, where it increased by more than 14 percentage points, almost two percentage points more than the increase in rural areas.

Keeping food prices low may benefit the BJP as far as urban seats are concerned.

But it’s worth remembering that the BJP won almost five times more seats in rural areas in 2014 than the urban areas. This is because rural India has six times more Lok Sabha seats than urban India. This explains why rural distress matters in Indian politics.",How the inflation equation could impact politics,3661,2.185195302
3492,0,"A nation sighed heavily as Team India lost the third test in the ongoing India-England Test series and thereby relinquished the number one ranking. However, the sigh might just be the sigh of relief as a metaphorical albatross weighing a truckload of bricks was lifted from the collective consciousness of the nation.

Nobody feels this more than India’s beleaguered captain MS Dhoni who over the last few years has donned more hats than Queen Elizabeth. “Well of course, it is good to be number one, but frankly speaking it was getting a little tiresome” said Dhoni with his characteristic smile. “Just like getting a girl to be your girlfriend is a lot more fun than maintaining her as a girlfriend, we would rather be an underdog and chase the top dog”. On a personal level, MS Dhoni admitted that the reduced expectations could finally help him stem the rate of graying of his facial hair and (at least) extend his reign as the #1 marketable cricketer of the world.

The loss also brought to an end what has arguably been the golden era of genteel domination. Unlike the lethal West Indies of the 80s, or the ruthless Australians of the 90s, who dominated other teams by absolutely pulverizing them into submission, this Indian team believed in charitable domination – in giving its opponent every opportunity to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat, and thereby keeping the fans from the competing nations interested till the very last ball is bowled. This has been acknowledged unanimously by cricketing legends. “Yeah mate, they’re a bunch of nice guys. You gotta give them that” said Ian Chappell. “But to me, the most amazing thing about this team is that they managed to stay number one so long with so few match winning bowlers!”

Further, it is not mere coincidence that the health of Test cricket questioned by one and all some time back is now seen to be in good shape (It obviously is, if the ICC is considering Timeless Tests) a mere two years after India at the top of the rankings. This inference is backed by hard data as well. An analysis of the clichés from Ravi Shastri’s commentary over the last decade reveals that the percentage usage of the cliché “Cricket is the real winner” was as much as four times in the Indian era as compared to the Australian era.

In the minds of many, India’s grace (on the field obviously) as champions has set sky high standards for the new champions. “Well, the English clearly have huge shoes to fill. It’s their call on whether they want to be known as a rude, arrogant bunch like the Aussies, or the gracious test-cricket saviours that are the Indians. If it is the latter, then these 200 plus run victories are simply not gonna cut it” said Peter Roebuck. “They can still make amends by taking the Oval test to the wire”",Independence from #1 test team ranking: Celebrating an era of charitable domination,2784,1.652298851

Milind Deora, contesting from Mumbai South as Congress candidate and challenging incumbent MP Arvind Sawant (Shiv Sena-BJP), released a video last week as part of his election campaign. The video has since travelled far and wide, and raised a number of questions. The brouhaha over it says something about the dichotomy in the business-politics relationship.

In the video, Mukesh Ambani and Uday Kotak are among those who endorse Deora to represent the constituency. Ambani says to the camera, “Milind is the man for South Bombay. Having represented South Bombay for 10 years, I believe Milind has in-depth knowledge of the social, economic and cultural ecosystem of the constituency”. This must be the first such public endorsement by the nation’s most wealthy and powerful industrialist. It is certainly a departure from the past in which industrialists were shy to proclaim their political preferences.

Commentators saw in it the portents of changes, the shifting of political winds as it were, against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If only a change of government and party in power were as simple as a video endorsement, politicians would not be juggling electoral arithmetic and there wouldn’t be a booming electoral economy. The 2019 general election will cost an unprecedented ₹50,000 crore or $7 billion, according to New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. That business and industry share a symbiotic relationship with politics is an open secret. For a number of historical reasons, both sides were content to keep it away from public glare. In a nation with deep poverty till recently, politicians aligned themselves with their majority voters but they simultaneously conducted the business of politics behind closed doors. The 1991 economic liberalisation and subsequent impacts have allowed this relationship to be aired. Ambani’s and Kotak’s endorsement should be seen in this light but that’s part of the story. The other part is in the relationship between India’s wealthiest and its political class. Ambani, as Raj Thackeray told a Mumbai audience this week, is a powerful businessman and knows which direction the wind is blowing. Ambani is India’s richest and the world’s 13th richest man with a net worth of more than $50 billion, according to Forbes this year. He is unlikely to put all his weight behind one political party or a candidate. The family is known to keep warm relations across the political spectrum. The dissonance comes from Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s repeated references to Prime Minister Modi’s government as “suit-boot ki sarkar” and Gandhi’s decision to keep industrialists at arm’s length. But the Congress party, especially Deora, is a realist. That’s why he had Ambani endorse him; it could help swing a close election. Besides, Deora’s family through his late father Murli Deora and the Ambanis go back a long way in the business-politics relationship, and are also part of south Mumbai’s swish set where business and politics seamlessly merge.

The video is the tip of the berg. What should concern us is how big businesses have managed to game the political system and how industrialists wear both hats at the same time. The book “India’s Porous State: Blurred Boundaries and the Evolving Business-State Relationship in India” by Christophe Jaffrelot, Atul Kohli, and Kanta Murali, identified three ways in which business plays a role in India’s politics.

It states, first, with business leaders as MPs, the representative power of business in the institution increases. According to the book, second, it enables business to make policy and influence how policies are implemented. Third, many of these business leader-MPs sit on parliamentary committees which have jurisdiction over their businesses thereby creating conflicts of interests. They cite dozens of examples including that of Vijay Mallya who sat on three Parliamentary Committees when he had business interests in all three sectors. From barely 14% in 1991, businessmen and industrialists formed 26% of the Lok Sabha, the book stated. Now that is cause for reflection.","Lok Sabha elections 2019| Big business in politics: Story of rising power, presence",4156,2.093358999

HISAR/GOHANA: Prime minister Narendra Modi on Friday during a campaign rally in Hisar took a swipe at Pakistan over the issue of water and said that he always accomplishes what he decides to do. Islamabad on Thursday had warned India that any attempt to divert flow of rivers will be considered an act of aggression.“Ek baar thaan liya, use kar ke hi rehta hoon. Mein Hisar ke bhaiyon aur behanon ko kehta hoon, aap ke haq ka paani ab Pakistan nahin bahega. Aur Modi hai, yeh kar ke rahega. Aur iske liye har zaroori kadam uthane shuru kar diye hai (Once I decide to do something, I always accomplish that. The water over which Haryana farmers have the right will not be allowed to flow to Pakistan now. I am Modi and I will accomplish this. We have started to take necessary steps for this),” he said.In a direct dig at Pakistan’s response to his statement at an earlier rally in Haryana on stopping water flowing to the neighbouring country, Modi said: “Aur mein paani bolta hoon toh aag wahan lagti hai (I talk of water here and it upsets them there).”The Prime Minister said that his government would invest Rs 3.5 lakh crore in five years to cater to the need of water for drinking and irrigation purposes.“I will put maximum emphasis in the next five years on the water under the Jal Jeevan Mission. We are planning to spend Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next five years so that our mothers and sisters, and farmers don’t have to face the shortage of water. Our effort is to ensure that farmers do not have to rely only on weather,” said Prime Minister Modi, while addressing an election rally in Hisar.The Prime Minister said that the traditional water system should be revamped in villages and a system should be developed where the household water is recycled and is used for irrigation. “And I’m hopeful that the country will be successful in doing so by 2024,” said Modi.He addressed two public meetings in Haryana on Friday, first in Gohana in Sonipat district and later in Hisar.Modi also slammed the opposition parties, saying that its leaders are busy fighting among themselves and cannot give stability to Haryana. “When the BJP government in Haryana was taking decisive steps for the development, what was the opposition doing? They could not fight with us. So, they were busy fighting among themselves. They destabilised their parties for self-interest. Can they give stability to Haryana,” asked Modi.Modi said Hisar was moving towards becoming the aviation centre of the country. “Earlier, people used to demand trains but now a washing yard for aeroplanes has been built in Hisar. The six-lane expressway between Delhi and Hisar has also been approved,” he said.In his address both in Gohana and Hisar, Modi didn’t forget to remind the public that Monday being a holiday owing to polling, making it an extended weekend, they should not miss the opportunity to exercise their franchise. Referring the number of athletes Sonipat has produced, he said: “This region has made India proud in every field, be it fighting in the wrestling ring or fighting against terrorism. Sonipat means Kisan, Jawan aur Pehlwan.”Patting chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s back, Modi said corruption was rampant during the Congress’ rule. Even in sports, there was corruption. “But it all changed after 2014. Since then the government has taken several steps in the field of sports.”In Video: I accomplish what I decide: PM Narendra Modi to Pakistan on water threat",I accomplish what I decide: PM Modi to Pakistan on water threat,3719,2.097337994

“Hooda sir did his best. He kicked out Ashok Khemka and got a clean chit for Vadra, but the certificate by Priyanka ji is priceless,” a Congress leader from Haryana told Faking News.

Coming soon – a new and improved Vadra.

“Robert Vadra got lucky, again,” he added.

Party sources say that after Priyanka publicly defended Robert Vadra, Congress leaders were filled with new enthusiasm and energy to defend Vadra on his controversial land and real estate deals.

“When party leaders, many of them ministers in the government, had run to TV studios and journalists to defend Vadra, questions were raised as to why these people were feeling obliged to defend a private citizen. But now all the family loyalists feel vindicated,” a party source revealed.

Sources further reveal that there was some confusion among family loyalists after opposition spread rumors that Vadra could be suspended from the family to keep the image of the family clean, which has been the party’s mission and objective since India’s independence.

But now with Priyanka supporting her hubby with full force, the party has got the signal loud and clear that Vadra too was a clean, honest, secular, and progressive person, who should be written about in a favorable manner by historians and commentators.

“Congratulations sir, you are the epitome of honesty and a source of inspiration for every budding entrepreneur and small farmer in our country,” a congratulatory note delivered to Robert Vadra read.

Political experts say that the emotional family talk delivered by Priyanka Gandhi, which was different from the usual family stories told by Rahul Gandhi, signified a shift in Congress party leadership.

“This clearly shows that Priyanka is better at telling stories, and thus a better leader than her brother Rahul.

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

There was a glimmer of hope when we learnt that Dr Subramanian Swamy was raring to go, but we were dumbfounded when we realized that it was to speak out against the decision and let loose a volley of cannonballs. So, in the end, we collectively took a decision to approach Mr.Jha.”

Singh disclosed that Jha has very gladly and graciously obliged. “He told us that he would go to any lengths to defend the Nehru-Gandhi family, even if it has to cut across party lines. There was one condition he made though – that he would bring up 2002 at least five times during the debate. We sighed and reluctantly agreed,” Singh said.","Modi govt requests Sanjay Jha to defend their non-cancellation of SPG cover for Priyanka, Vadra",1594,2.132998745

3505,0,"Stung by Team India’s failure to yet again make it to the semi-finals stage in this year’s T-20 World Cup, BCCI has taken the bold step of banning Indian players from playing in subsequent editions of IPL in hope of reviving the team’s fortunes in the shortest format of the game.

“Ever since we launched IPL in 2008 following India’s maiden World Cup triumph, the team’s form at the international level in the shortest format of the game has been in a slump. While players from other countries participating in IPL sharpen their skills and deliver for their nations, our players invariably seem to get burned out or worse, experience a slump in form thereafter. So in the interests of Indian cricket, we have decided to ban Indian players henceforth from IPL,” explained a glum faced IPL Commissioner, Rajeev Shukla.

The place of Indian players will probably be taken by Pakistani players, he disclosed. “Yes, we’ll allow Pakistanis to come in. If their T-20 skills can similarly deteriorate, then it will be the icing on the cake for Indian cricket,” he added, eyes momentarily lighting up before he resumed his mournful look.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has rejected the IPL commissioner’s overtures to invite Pakistani players. “Initially, we felt bad that Pakistanis were banned from playing in IPL. But now, in hindsight, we are grateful to the Indian board for having kept them out for the sake of Pakistani cricket. So our message to IPL commissioner is ‘hum pe ek ehsaan karne, ki ham pe koi ehsaan na karna’,” said PCB chairman Ashraff Zaka.

A few Indian cricketers have not reacted well to the news. Batting prodigy Rohit Sharma has made it clear that he has no intentions of quitting the league. “It would be very ungrateful of me to quit the league that I owe everything in my life to. I thank the people for whatever little love and support I received from them while playing for India, but I’m afraid it (representing India) can’t go on anymore,” said Sharma, who is popularly known as the Bradman of IPL. He also claimed the support of a dozen cricketers that included Ravinder Jadeja , Murali Vijay and Vinay Kumar.

Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri refused to comment on the issue citing contractual obligations.

Employees of an IT company went berserk and ransacked their office beyond recognition after they realized that the system administrators had blocked access to Cricinfo and other cricket based websites on office computers. The management had already disallowed watching sports or even news channels during international cricket matches involving India for over a year now, leaving the employees to get updates from Cricinfo and other websites.

A pall of gloom descended over the employees of SA Technologies Limited around lunch time when they discovered this new decree, but the employees went violently furious by the end of the office time around 6.15 PM, when they realized that they had missed the legendary innings of Sachin Tendulkar – the first ever double century scored in a one-day international cricket match.

“Come on man, don’t we have basic human rights guaranteed here? The whole nation was rejoicing and here we had no idea what was happening. This is criminal. It is high time “right to watch cricket” is declared a fundamental right.” Aadeesh Deshpande, one of the aggrieved employees complained.

Some people believe he is legend, some think he is God, others don’t have a right to life

Employees have been sitting outside their office since 6.30 PM and demanding compensation from the management and the owners of the company for denying them a chance to witness this historical moment. The amount or the nature of compensation is not yet known, but the management has promised to gift authenticated VCDs of Sachin Tendulkar’s innings to all the employees.

Meanwhile, Cricket fans from all over the country too have come up in support of these employees and have pushed for constitutional reforms in the country so that no one else goes through the same torture in the future.

“If one can’t declare a new fundamental right of watching cricket, at least declare Sachin as God, what more proof is needed now?” said one of the Sachin fans, arguing that if Sachin was declared God, stopping people from watching cricket would amount to stopping someone from practicing their religion, and hence unconstitutional.",Employees ransack office after having missed Sachin’s double century,2141,1.447921532

NEW DELHI: The results of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections should make BJP worry about its prospects in Jharkhand. The ruling party may be forced to tweak its strategy when Jharkhand goes to polls in December.The reason for BJP’s worry may originate from the fact that Jharkhand shares some common political situations with Maharashtra and Haryana which went to polls on October 21.After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the Narendra Modi government came to power, while Maharashtra and Haryana were the first two states to go to polls in October, Jharkhand had faced elections in December the same year.Second, riding on Modi wave, BJP won elections in Jharkhand too.Third, for the first time, Modi and BJP president Amit Shah experimented with social engineering in the three states. In all the three states, BJP installed unconventional chief ministers.Devendra Fadnavis, a Brahmin, took over as the chief minister of Maharashtra which is dominated politically by Marathas. Similarly, Manohar Lal Khattar, a Punjabi, took over the reins of the state where Jats have always dominated the politics.After being carved out as a separate state from Bihar in 2000, tribal-dominated Jharkhand had seen five chief ministers - Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda, Shibu Soren, Madhu Koda, Hemant Soren. All these five leaders belong to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category.However, after the 2014 Jharkhand assembly election, BJP chose non-tribal Raghubar Das to head the state.Das comes from the OBC category. He is a teli - a caste which was traditionally engaged in the profession of oil-pressing - became the first non-tribal leader to become the chief minister of the state.Thursday’s results in Maharashtra and Jharkhand were below BJP’s expectations. It had hoped to win 75 of the 90 seats in Haryana and 145 of the 288 seats in Maharashtra.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, in order to offset the damage due to caste equations besides economic slowdown, joblessness and agrarian distress in both the states, depended heavily on nationalistic issues in their campaign.The two harped on nullification of Articles 370 and 35A changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir. They talked of the 2016 surgical strikes and air strikes in February in retaliation to Pulwama terror attack. They also discussed banning instant triple talaq.Amit Shah promised to implement National Register of Citizens (NRC) on the national level by 2024.However, caste politics played a major part in checking BJP’s juggernaut.The BJP had to bear the brunt of going against the caste equations in Haryana and Maharashtra - in fact more in Haryana than in Maharashtra.Haryana was sharply divided between Jats and non-Jats. The Jats went against BJP which kept the party from touching the majority mark of 46 seats.On the other hand, a weakened Congress, which was hardly expected to cross even the double digit, became the second largest party by winning 31 seats. The credit goes to the party installing former chief minister Bhupinder Hooda , a Jat, just before the elections.The other Jat-led party - Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) headed by Dushyant Chautala - was the third largest party winning 10 seats.Similarly, going against the tide of caste proved challenging for BJP in Maharashtra.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar , who is considered as the tallest Maratha leader, weaned away the community members.It did not help BJP much even though it went out of its way to woo the Marathas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah invoked Marathas’ tallest and historical icon Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in several of their election rallies in the state.But they could not control the damage completely.As in Haryana and Maharashtra, BJP is likely to face the trouble of the voters getting divided between tribal and non-tribal supporters.The opposition parties, particularly tribal-dominated and former chief minister Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and Lalu Prasad’s RJD will try their best to wean away the tribal voters from BJP.By the time Jharkhand elections are held in December, nullification of Article 370 and banning instant triple talaq will get older and, therefore, lose their sheen.BJP is likely to change its discourse in Jharkhand to overcome the sentiments against installing a non-tribal as CM, economic slowdown, joblessness and farmers’ distress.Besides tribal identity, joblessness is likely to become a major election issue in Jharkhand which has several industrial towns such as Jamshedpur and Bokaro. Several factories are facing the impact of economic recession and have been forced to either shut down or curtail shifts.Raking up nationalistic issues may have controlled some damage to the BJP governments in Maharashtra and Haryana. But it may not be enough to surmount the challenges in Jharkhand.","Election results 2019: Why Maharashtra, Haryana outcome poses risk for BJP in Jharkhand",5190,2.157996146

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought the Union government and the state of Haryana’s response on a plea filed by Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala , seeking directions to provide him a security cover through a central security agency. In his petition, Dushyant has informed HC about threat to his life from an international gang.When the matter came up for hearing before Justice Sanjay Kumar of HC on Thursday, additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain appeared on behalf of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and told the HC that government is assessing the perception of threat as claimed by Dushyant. Jain further informed that it is a state subject and Centre provides security only in those cases where the perception of threat is very high. He, however, said that matter is under examination of central agency.The Haryana government counsel informed the court that already an additional security personnell has been provided to Dushyant after his complaint. However, the petitioner’s counsel informed that as gunmen cannot accompany Dushyant in the chopper, no security personnel has been provided to him when he lands in any area for campaigning in assembly polls.During hearing, Justice Kumar orally asked the state government to examine if any security personnel can be provided to him at the place where his chopper lands.HC has now adjourned the hearing of the case for Friday, asking the counsels for Union and state government to seek instructions from the respective governments on the issue.In his plea filed through advocate Naresh Shekhawat, the former Hisar MP, who is now contesting assembly polls from Uchana assembly seat, claimed to have received a call from a person calling from Dubai. According to the petition, he has been threatened not to campaign vigorously in the state assembly elections, else he would face dire consequences. According to Dushyant, the man who allegedly threatened him claimed that he was a member of an international gang. After Dushyant’s complaint, an FIR has also been registered in this regard by Jind district police.","High court asks Centre, Haryana government to respond to Dushyant Chautala’s plea for security",2321,1.551055579
3511,0,"With the race to the Rashtrapathi Bhavan entering the final phase, Sonia Gandhi called for a crucial meeting at her 10 Janpath residence with Dr. Manmonhan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Rahul Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. What happened in this crucial meeting? The UnReal Times brings you the details.

Seen sitting at the head of the table in a mammoth chair is Sonia Gandhi in a regal posture. Across the table at the other end, Mamata Banerjee is seen slouching on her chair, noisily filing her fingernails. Pranab Mukherjee and Rahul Gandhi are sitting on either side of Sonia Gandhi whereas Dr. Manmohan Singh is sitting midway on one side of the table throwing nervous glances at Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee in turns. Sonia’s bodyguards and some Congress workers are seen standing at a distance of a few feet around the table in a circle.

Sonia Gandhi: Okay, so what are our options now?

Manmohan Singh: Madam, first there is PA Sangma.

Sonia Gandhi: That Nepali?!? No way will I make a foreigner the President of India!

Manmohan Singh: But Madam, Sangma ji is not a foreigner. He is from Meghalaya. Besides you also… (Sonia turns to glare at Dr. Singh)

Manmohan Singh: Er.. right Madam, we cannot have a Nepali as the President.

Sonia Gandhi: Glad you agree. So who else?

Manmohan Singh (nervously smiles at Mamata Banerjee): Er.. Didi had a suggestion for the Presidential candidate as well. Didi, if you will tell Madam .

Mamata Banerjee (looks up at Sonia): Vuee vuant Shomnath Bonorjee ash Preshidunt.

Sonia stares back blankly at Mamata for a second, then turns to Pranab Mukherjee quizzically

Pranab Mukherjee: Wot shee meansh ish Shomnath Bonorjee kud bhee a ghud condidate.

Sonia stares blankly at Pranab, then turns to Dr. Singh

Manmohan Singh: Somanth Chatterjee Madam.

Sonia Gandhi: Ah I see. Well, what can I say? Obviously I cannot trash the suggestion instantly seeing that it comes from Didi. But let’s keep it in our consideration set, shall we?

At that point the meeting is interrupted by a loud knock at the door.

Voice outside: Alak niranjan! Kya is Baba ko ghar se kuch milega?

Sonia Gandhi: Whats this noise? Who’s that?

Pranab Mukherjee: Shome poor Baba, Madam, letsh ignore him.

Sonia Gandhi: Hmm. So as I was saying…

Voice outside: Alak Niranjan! Kya is Baba ko ghar se kuch milega?

Sonia Gandhi (irritated): Uff, what rubbish yaa! Rahul, go find out who it is and what he wants

(Rahul walks to the door and opens it to find Baba Ramdev standing there with outstretched arms. “Come to Baba,” he says with a smile)

Rahul Gandhi: Mummy, its Baba Ramdev. He wants a hug and some black money from abroad.

Sonia Gandhi (impatiently): Well, hug him, and ask him to ‘aage badho‘ for black money.

Rahul Gandhi does so and Baba Ramdev moves on. The meeting continues.

Sonia Gandhi: Okay. Let’s continue. Who else?

Manmohan Singh: Pranab da Madam. Given his distinguished career, and the fact that he has no more chance to be the PM thanks to the performance of my bumbling government, he deserves to be made the President Madam.

Sonia Gandhi: Hmm. I hear you Manmohan ji. But…

Manmohan Singh: Yes Madam?

Sonia Gandhi (sighs deeply): Rajiv ji used to say Pranab da will make a lousy President. In 1984, after Indira ji’s assassination when Rajiv ji asked Pranab da on who should be the PM, he said the seniormost Congress leader should be the PM.

At this, there’s a collective gasp in the room, as everyone turns to look at Pranabda. After a brief silence…

Pranabda (sniffs softly): Madam, I am so shorry! That was a long time ago. I wash young and foolish! I have learnt my leshon now Madam. I’ll never say crap like that again! Boo hoo! (Slams his head on the table and sobs loudly)

Sonia Gandhi: Okay Pranab da, let’s try this again. After the 2014 elections, if there’s a hung parliament and there’s no clear winner, who will become the Prime Minister?

Pranabda (immediately): Rahul, Madam.

Everybody claps.

Sonia Gandhi (satisfied): Okay, he’s good to go. I hereby announce Pranab da as our Presidential candidate.

3512,0,"The Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal made a sensational revelation today that Lord Shiva is actually an AAP supporter. A study conducted by AAP’s internal committee confirmed this claim.

Addressing a press conference, the AAP supremo said, “We were always aware of our huge following across the globe but it came as a pleasant surprise to learn that even Lord Shiva has been supporting our party ever since its inception.”

“We concluded this after studying the report which suggested that we have an identical approach to solve critical issues like Lord Shiva. For example, Lord Shiva consumed poison to save the universe just like what our Bhagwant Mann is doing to save the youth of Punjab.”

“But how?” we sought a clarification.

“He is on a mission to drink every single drop of alcohol to control rising alcoholism, and if we come to power, we will employ similar measures to curb the menace of drug abuse as well in Punjab.”

“But isn’t AAP just a 4-year-old party?”

To this he said, “Yes, AAP as a party is relatively new in Indian politics but its ideologies are not. People have been following the values of AAP since time immemorial.”

Emphasizing on Lord Shiva’s political inclination, he said, ““Lord Shiva is regarded as limitless, transcendent, unchanging and formless. Who else other than an AAP supporter could possess these qualities? Hence, Shiva is an AAP supporter.”

This news has given AAP’s election campaign in Punjab, Canada, and Goa a new lease of life and people are attending their rallies and visiting AAP offices across the country in numbers to have a glimpse of the party workers. Even experts are predicting them to sweep all seats in the upcoming assembly elections.

Meanwhile, fresh evidences are emerging from different parts of the world that lend credence to the notion that AAP’s values and ideologies were followed in ancient times as well. During an excavation, archeologists have found Aam Aadmi caps and brooms at the site of Mohenjo Daro, which indicates the presence of AAP party workers during Indus Valley Civilization. They have also found WiFi towers under the ground, which they believe were fully functional during that period.

This development, however, has forced Ashutosh Gwarikar to defer the release date of his movie Mohenjo Daro, as he will now have to re-shoot part of the movie to portray AAP’s contributions in Mohenjo Daro and its way of life.","“Lord Shiva drank poison to save the universe, which confirms he is an AAP supporter” : Kejriwal",2416,1.821192053

“It was all going fine. Even the greatest of movie reviewers couldn’t come near my shadow. But the onslaught of Arvindji was too much to handle. Many people across the country began to follow his movie reviews and no one was paying heed to my insightful critiques. His latest review of Drishyam was the nail in the coffin. I just knew instinctively, that I had to stop right there and quit honorably. So that’s what I did,” Adarsh told The UnReal Times.

“I heard from sources that the CM has a lot more movies lined up – Rogue Nation being the next one. He’s planning to watch them first day first show itself, I’ve heard. I sometimes watch the matinee show or even the night show, especially for movies that are bound to be real lousy. And Sajid Khan movies tho, I don’t watch at all. But Arvindji is on the job every time. I simply couldn’t have gone on,” Adarsh added.

Sources added that the Delhi CM’s movie reviews have amazed PM Narendra Modi too. “Yaar, this guy goes to movies more frequently than I go on foreign tours! I’ve some catching up to do,” the PM apparently said.

A lawsuit claiming $5 million has been filed against the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) by a company that acquired the rights to hold the Afghanistan Premier League (APL) in 2018.

The board last year postponed the 2019 edition of APL after the league’s commercial partner failed to pay the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) rights money.

The board had terminated the agreement, citing concerns about the integrity of people associated with Snixer Sports, the partners.

“In our endeavour to safeguard the same, we were left with no other option but to resort to legal remedies against the biased and illegal conduct of ACB,” an official of the management company, Snixer Sports, told The Dawn about the lawsuit filed at an arbitration court in London.

“Each franchisee spends close to 1.5 million USD per team and with 5 teams its 7.5 million. Around 2 million will be spent by promoters every season to sustain the league, which pushes the total league cost to around USD 10 million per season. There is no market due of APL season 1 and Snixer has cleared 100 per cent market payments in 60 days of the league commencement despite facing losses of over USD 3 million in the inaugural season,” the official added.

Meanwhile, the board has stated that they terminated the contract because Snixer Sports failed to pay the dues as per the mutual agreement.

“Snixer Sports and people connected to them possessed a severe risk to the integrity of the league. The ICC Anti-Corruption Unit is aware of these risks and are investigating several cases,” ACB spokesperson Mohammad Ibrahim Momand said.

“The ACB is happy that they claimed because we don’t have to pay them, in fact they (Snixers) owe ACB dues of the last (APL) season. They were a risk for APL integrity as well, first of all they have to clear our dues and then our legal team will deal with their legal team or with the court as required,” he added.",Lawsuit claiming $5 million filed against Afghan cricket board,1955,2.148337596
3517,0,"It has come to light that Indo-Guyanese cricketer, Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, who yet again proved to be a thorn in the flesh of the Indian cricket team with his obdurate batting in the Kotla Test, may have an all too real Bihari connection: As per records with the Purnia District Administration (Purnia is a district in North East Bihar), Shivnaraine Chanderpaul’s great great grand uncle, Pawan Kumar Chanedrapal, had emigrated to Guyana circa 1873. This makes Shivnaraine a bona–fide Bihari from his mother’s side.

It also makes Shivnaraine the greatest cricketer ever of Bihari origin or from Bihar, even without taking his staggering batting record into account, considering that Bihar has not produced many Test cricketers to begin with. Quickly acting on this, Bihar’s Nitish Kumar Government has decided to fete the West Indian with the inaugural ‘Bihari Cricketer of the Decade’ award. “We were looking to honour Bihari Test Cricketers but were told that there aren’t any. Just when we were about to settle for Dhoni despite his shady Bihari roots (Dhoni hails from Uttrakhand and lives in Jharkhand), I was informed that Shivnaraine’s ancestor was from Bihar. My joy knew no bounds!” gushed Bihar CM Nitish Kumar.

Biharis have reacted to the news with joy and Chanderpaul posters are actually outselling Tendulkar’s in many pockets of Bihar. The million dollar question now doing the rounds is what Shivnaraine’s caste is. Purnia MLA, Ashok Singh, conjectured that he could be a Bhumihar or a Kayasth but does not rule out his being a Kurmi either. RDJ supremo, Laloo Yadav, however, contends that Chanderpaul is a Yadav and that the Bihar Government is doing a disservce to the Yadav community by not officially declaring the great West Indian’s caste affliation.

To avoid any further politicization of the issue, the Nitish Kumar Government is trying to establish Chanderpaul’s caste but this is proving to be tougher than anticipated. For one, the district administration is only in possession of Chanderpal’s great great grand uncle’s emigration record and not his birth certificate which was unfortunately lost when the district’s birth certificate office was inundated during the great Kosi flood of 1905.

When the Bihar Government’s Chief Secretary tried to discreetly ask Chanderpaul what his caste was, the West Indian, whose knowledge of Indian culture and especially its caste groupings is evidently sketchy replied, “No, I am not interested in getting cast in any movie. Cricket remains my top priority.”

Subsequently, the Nitish Kumar Government has decided to invent a new caste for the great cricketer – “Kirkitstud” – to put the caste controversy to rest, at least for the time being.",Shivnaraine Chanderpaul feted by Nitish Kumar for being best cricketer ever of Bihari origin,2714,1.694915254
3518,0,"In Sonia Gandhi’s absence, the Congress leadership comprising the PM, Chidambaram, Pranab da, Kapil Sibal, Digvijay Singh and Rahul Gandhi – convened in 10,Janpath to formulate strategies to tackle the various crises confronting the rudderless Government. Fortunately, the meeting was bugged and recorded by Chidambaram, who was kind enough to share it with The Unreal Times. We present below an unabridged version of the recording:

Prime Minister (wiping the sweat trickling from the triangular area of his turban): Madam ji shouldn’t have left us during this time. What do I do with so many people gunning for me?

Chidambaram: Mr. PM, it is in times of adversity that you have to put up your bravest front. Not speaking much doesn’t mean you are dumb.

Prime Minister: I am fed up of finding new skeletons in my bag.

Rahul Gandhi (excited): Oh Uncle, where did you find the skeletons? Did you visit Bhatta Parsaul?

Digvijay Singh (in a frustrated tone): Rahul Baba, it’s a phrase in English language. You should have completed that damn course in videsh I must say.

Chidambaram (now adjusting the pleats in his veshti): Can we raise the matter of right wing terror through Diggy Raja and see if we can distract the people? If it backfires, we can always go back to the “It’s Diggy’s personal opinion” card.

Pranab Mukherjee: Kali maa, PC ! Haaw do you know about deesh idea when I had discoshed it in my chamber only today?

Chidambaram (passing an impish smile): Pronob da, it’s sheer coincidence, don’t get “bugged”!

Rahul Gandhi: Yeah, the bugs only bite the aam aadmi. Pronob da you are khaas aadmi. Chill!

Digvijay Singh: Rahul Baba for God’s sake, bugged doesn’t have to do anything with the khatmals.

At this point, Kapil Sibal’s mobile phone rings to the tune of Britney Spears’ hit number “Oops I did it again…”. Just as Pranabda starts tapping his feet and swaying gently, Sibal cuts short the tune by taking the call.

Sibal: Hello… What?…. No, no I do not want to see another Lokpal..What? Trilokpal? Is that another bill? Ohh… an aam aadmi. Tell him to….

There is a commotion in the room as Rahul Gandhi jumps to snatch the phone from Sibal.

Rahul Gandhi: Hello ! I would like to meet the aam aadmi. Be it Lokpal, Jokepal or Trilokpal

Digvijay Singh: First ask if he is from UP. That is your jurisdiction. You don’t need to worry about the aam aadmis of the whole country.

Prime Minister (on an altogether different tangent): Just because I am not speaking doesn’t mean that I don’t listen either. I am getting headaches now. Last night Karuna ji called to recite a poem about father-daughter relationship… then I had a hard time fending questions from Gurusharan ji on daily chores. After a tough night, what do I get to hear in the morning? Madam ji is out of India for 3 weeks!

Digvijay Singh: Didn’t you hear my latest on right wing terror theory? I explained in detail how the right wing terror groups caused Madam ji to fall ill, because of which she had to go to the US. Madam ji is out for three weeks. Let’s cook up something. We are facing a lot of flak for 2G, CWG and terrorist attacks.

Chidambaram: What I suggest is this. Let us announce bringing out VDCA and VDTA schemes for the corrupt and terrorists. The schemes – voluntary disclosure of corruption acts (VDCA) and voluntary disclosure of terrorist acts (VDTA) will grant immunity to those who come forward and tell us all about their deeds – we did something similar with tax evaders you see. This way we’ll show to our countrymen that we are serious about the two issues the opposition is making a lot of hue and cry about, and also save our skin by stopping any further damage to the Cabinet that is already looking rather depleted.

Pranab Mukherjee: What eef it torns out that 90% of the MPs ashoshated with corrupshon dishclosh about their dealings? What faish will we show to the neishoan?

Kapil Sibal: Pronob Da, its simple. The nation forgets everything very soon. Didn’t you see my experiments with Anna and Baba? I swung the balance easily. Time’s a great healer. There are manifold benefits of the schemes. Firstly, the schemes will guarantee that people like Anna Hazare do not hijack prime time on National television as they will be left with nothing to expose. Secondly, we can paint the people declaring themselves under the schemes as being influenced by Rahul ji’s vision. Thirdly, the cabinet will be saved. With half of our ministers being sacked on corruption charges, the day is not far when we’ll have just our honest PM ji managing everything on his own.

Rahul Gandhi (dreamily): My vision is to eat in 500 Dalit homes by the time UP elections come. I haven’t thought beyond that.

Digvijay Singh: Baba, sometimes I feel that I should return to MP and begin life afresh… because with you, it’s always like coming back to where it all began.

Rahul Gandhi: It began with Kalavati!

Prime Minister: Why don’t you come and take my seat Rahul Baba? It’s time you did so because my chair is one place where you do not have to speak and that will serve you better!

Chidambaram: So gentlemen of honor, we decide here that Sibal drafts the schemes, Pronob Da does the damage control in the Parliament and outside of it, Diggy and I talk about right wing terror to distract everyone.

Rahul Gandhi: And me? I am supposed to take the decision in Mom’s absence.

Chidambaram: You could… um… continue visiting aam aadmis and having dinner with them.

Prime Minister: Will I get to know what’s my role too?

Kapil Sibal: The role that you enact to perfection. Keep quiet!

Since making his debut in the 50-over format in 2016, Jasprit Bumrah has had a meteoric rise and has become the leader of India’s pace attack. His unmatched accuracy, ability to keep a lid on runs coupled with wicket taking abilities, make him an asset for captain Virat Kohli. The extent of Bumrah’s outstanding start to his ODI career can be gauged from the fact that he is the second fastest Indian to the 100-wicket mark, missing Mohammed Shami’s mark by just one match.

His performances on flat Indian tracks have also been a highlight of his short career so far. But ever since his return from injury, sustained after India’s tour of West Indies last year, the paceman has not been at his best. In the six ODIs he has played this year, Bumrah has managed to pick only 1 wicket and averages a rather unbelievable 287. The three-match India vs South Africa series thus provides a perfect platform for the paceman to return to form.

Bumrah played 3 ODIs against Australia at home in January, and picked up only 1 wicket in the entire series, which India managed to win 2-1. But the real shocker came in New Zealand as he failed to pick up a single wicket in the three matches, and also went for runs. The direct impact was seen in the result as India were whitewashed in an ODI series after 31 long years.

The paceman though holds a good record against South Africa and that is where Indian fans can hope for a revival. He has picked up 12 wickets in 8 matches against the Proteas, but the impressive part lies in the economy. Bumrah has conceded only 3.83 runs per over against South Africa. That shows how difficult it is to get him away.

The Indian team is reeling from the impact of the twin whitewashes, in ODIs and Tests, in New Zealand and needs a good series against South Africa to get back to wining ways. Bumrah and Virat Kohli will be the two players the team will look at to get them out of this hole and both are ready for the challenge.",India vs South Africa: Chance for Jasprit Bumrah to end uncharacteristic slump in ODIs,2000,1.85

However, he has put forward one condition; Kashyap will have to explain the plot of his film ‘No Smoking’ in return.

Narendra Modi watching No Smoking

Earlier, The Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India had announced that movies featuring Pakistani actors will not be screened in single screen theaters in Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat. This announcement is likely to affect Karan Johar’s upcoming release ‘Ae Dil hai Mushkil’ and Kashyap came out in support of the film. In a series of tweets, he asked why PM Modi shouldn’t face action as well for his visit to Pakistan if we are boycotting everything from there.

“During one of his recent visits, Modi ji saw this film No Smoking during the flight. Ever since he saw that, he has been moving around in a confused state of mind. He just couldn’t understand what was happening in the film. He asked all of us in the PMO but even we didn’t have a clue. Only No Smoking we understand is that board in front of which we smoke”, a PMO official said.

“These questions by Anurag Kashyap have provided the perfect opportunity for Modi Ji. He can finally ask Kashyap to explain the plot and in return, Modi ji will answer all his questions on the ban or boycott of Pakistani artists. Hopefully, Kashyap will explain the plot to Modi Ji’s satisfaction and he will stop asking us to see the film again and again to understand the film”, he added.

Meanwhile, Ram Gopal Verma has vowed to never ask any questions to Narendra Modi fearing that he will be asked to explain what ‘RGV ki Aag’ was.","Narendra Modi agrees to answer Anurag Kashyap's questions, asks him to explain plot of 'No Smoking' in return",1742,1.607347876
3523,0,"Modi government’s decision to hit back at Pakistan rename 7, Race Course Road to 7, Lok Kalyan Marg has kicked up a fresh controversy. Fresh from a surgery that slimmed and trimmed his tongue, Arvind Kejriwal put it to immediate use by delivering a strong tongue-lashing to PM Modi, claiming that his decision to rename India’s most famous address is proof of his appeasement of IPL founder Lalit Kumar Modi.

“Sab mile huey hain ji!” declared the Delhi CM in a video address that was posted on AAP’s Facebook page. “Modiji is fooling no one when he says that LKM stands for Lok Kalyan Marg. The people of this country can clearly see that it stands for the corrupt Lalit Kumar Modi, against whom Modiji refuses to act.”

Kejriwal’s act was quickly followed by AAP spokesperson, The Ashutosh, who tweeted angrily: “Why the Modi is distrackting the public from Uri attacks, by renaming the Race Coarse Road to the Lol Kalyan Marg ?! Will the Modi answer?”

Virulently anti-AAP Times Now editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami too chose to echo the Delhi CM’s message, claiming a Times Now #LalitGate impact and further went on to demand EAM Sushma Swaraj’s resignation. Rival channel India Today wasn’t far behind, with journalist Rajdeep Sardesai overcoming the tyranny of distance and taking the next flight to Montenegro for another Lalit Modi exclusive.

Strangely, Kejriwal’s rant hasn’t angered the BJP as much as it usually does. “For once, we don’t mind his nonsense, to be honest. Particularly if it helps move the focus of our Bhakts from our response to the Uri attacks. I hope they start going after Kejriwal on Twitter instead of Modiji,” said BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli.

A PMO source later said that PM Modi was tempted to tweet that LKM really stood for LK Advani and MM Joshi, but wisely chose to desist.

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Also Watch l How Jyotiraditya Scindia’s induction will help the BJP

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Also read: What may have triggered Jyotiraditya Scindia to quit Congress

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party.","As Congress scrambles to save MP govt, buzz grows of internal rift in BJP",3065,1.827079935
3525,0,"When an ordinary person gets trapped in an elevator, he/she presses the red button if there’s one, or calls someone he/she knows to arrange for rescue. Then he/she waits patiently, perhaps with a hint of anxiety, until the rescue team arrives and gets him/her out. Now how might our celebrities respond if they happen to get trapped in an elevator? (Click here for Part I and Part II in this series)

Manohar Lal Khattar

The understated Haryana CM waits patiently as the rescue team pries open the elevator doors and gets him out. As he walks out of the elevator, cameras clicking away all around him, Sagarika Ghose shoves a mike in Khattar’s face and asks, “Sir you are the first non-Jat CM to be trapped in an elevator. How does it feel?”

K Chandrashekar Rao

Soon after KCR gets trapped in the elevator, his party TRS takes to the streets alleging that this is a grand conspiracy by Chandra Babu Naidu who is jealous of the KCR’s good governance. TRS issues a call for a bandh and million march on the iconic Tank Bund bridge. Stray incidents of stone pelting are reported in Osmania University.

Speaking to media outlets on his phone from the elevator, KCR, in another inspired bout of rhetoric, says that he is ready to be a Hitler to those who do not maintain elevators properly and threatened to break the neck of the lift operator. Worried that TV9 and ABN Andhrajyoti might make fun of this incident, cable operators immediately black out the two channels.

Eventually, the elevator gets repaired, KCR walks out and promptly announces 5 lakh each as compensation to the rest of the people stuck in the elevator along with him.

Amit Shah

One moment the elevator is smoothly purring along. The next moment it lurches to a stop, drawing gasps from its occupants, and throwing them off-balance. Anxiety slowly sets in, as occupants realize that the lift is stuck and wouldn’t open.

Amit Shah, however, is completely unperturbed. He coolly walks out of the other elevator, nodding to the rescue team he’d called 15 minutes earlier when he’d received information that the lift will get struck.

Tarun Tejpal

Minutes after the elevator lurches to the stop, Tarun Tejpal presses the panic button and calls for rescue. A team rushes to the building immediately, only it isn’t the rescue team but the Goa police. They wedge the elevator doors open, and haul Tejpal away.

Arnab Goswami

Screeeech!

The lift comes to a halt.

For a second…just one second, Arnab is silent. Then his eyes and skin take on a shade of green, his jaw gets set and a maniacal gleam enters his eyes.

“Did you just get stuck, Mister elevator?” Arnab asks in a low growl, dripping with menace.

The elevator obviously doesn’t respond. The green in Arnab’s eyes turns brighter. With Newshour’s soundtrack playing in his mind, he launches into his opening tirade.

“GOOD EVENING. TONIGHT I HAVE FIVE QUESTIONS FOR MISTER ELEVATOR!”

“QUESTION 1. WHY DID YOU TRAP AN HONEST TAXPAYER IN YOUR CLUTCHES?”

“QUESTION 2. WHY DO YOU OPEN YOUR DOORS FOR POWERFUL POLITICIANS, BUT NOT FOR THE ORDINARY TAXPAYER. WHY THIS HYPOCRISY, MISTER ELEVATOR?”

The elevator’s doors now begin to quiver ever so slightly. Arnab pulls a sheaf of papers from his jacket pocket and waves them threateningly.

“QUESTION 3. I HAVE DOCUMENTS THAT SHOW THAT MAINTENANCE PAYS RS. 5 LAKHS EVERY YEAR ON YOU, MISTER ELEVATOR? WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY?”

“QUESTION 4. DID YOU NOT FUNCTION WELL DURING CONGRESS-NCP GOVERNMENT, MISTER ELEVATOR? WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS POLITICAL? THE NATION DEMANDS TO KNOW, MISTER ELEVATOR!”

The elevator’s doors are now rattling uncontrollably. Arnab goes for the kill.

“QUESTION 5. ARE YOU TRYING TO DODGE MY QUESTION, MISTER ELEVATOR?”

Suddenly, the elevator’s doors fly outwards with a loud crack, along with part of the wall. Arnab steps through the yawning opening, adjusts his tie and says, “That’s it for tonight on your channel, ladies and gentlemen. See you tomorrow. Good night.”

Meanwhile, a tweet goes up from Times Now’s official Twitter handle: “TIMES NOW IMPACT: Mumbai buildings renovate their elevators after Times Now report”

MUMBAI: A 40-point common minimum programme (CMP) was finalised by Shiv Sena NCP and Congress on Thursday in the first concrete step towards government formation. It will now be shared with the chiefs of the three parties, who will confer over the weekend and the final blueprint is expected by November 19.With the draft CMP wrapped up, attention has turned to power sharing, and a broad consensus seems to be emerging on Sena getting 16 cabinet members, NCP 14 and Congress 12. The Speaker is likely to be from Congress, and will get a deputy from Sena, while the legislative council chairman’s post will go to NCP, with the deputy’s chair, again, for Sena.The top posts seem to be far from decided. A senior Congress leader said: “Shiv Sena has staked claim for the CM’s post. It is not yet clear if it will be for five years or it will be by rotation for two and half years, or it should be for an equal period among Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP.” Stressing that all posts and cabinet berths will be decided by consensus, the leader added that a decision on deputy CM will be taken after deliberations among senior leaders of all three parties.As efforts for government formation seemed to pick up momentum in Mumbai, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court, alleging that the change in Sena’s stand, which had fought the polls with BJP, was “nothing but betrayal of people’s trust reposed in the NDA”. It may be listed for hearing in the next few days. In the tri-party camp, the mood was upbeat. “We are determined to provide a stable, non-BJP government as people of Maharashtra do not want a mid-term poll,’’ said Congress’ Vijay Wadettiwar.Talking about the draft CMP, former Congress CM Prithviraj Chavan told TOI: “We took note of Shiv Sena’s manifesto as well as our own manifesto and drafted the CMP. It is not an election manifesto, but an action plan for providing clean and transparent administration. Contentious issues have been dropped.”On Thursday, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray first held a meeting with Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat and NCP’s Jayant Patil on the CMP. It was followed by a joint meeting of senior Congress and NCP leaders, and later in the evening, Congress, NCP and Sena leaders met to finalise the draft CMP at the office of Chhagan Bhujbal’s MET education trust. Congress leaders Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde, Manikrao Thakre and Wadettiwar, NCP’s Jayant Patil, Nawab Malik and Bhujbal, and Sena’s Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai were present.Chavan, Malik and Shinde said the draft will be submitted to Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray in a day or two. The three are expected to jointly deliberate on the contents and finalise the document by Sunday. Once approved, Uddhav may meet Pawar on Sunday itself, and subsequently, they are likely to meet Sonia in New Delhi on November 19. “We feel that once the final document is ready, Pawar, Thackeray and Gandhi will meet in New Delhi to finalise the future course of action, particularly formation of government and power sharing,” said a senior Congress leader.Though Maharashtra is under President’s rule, the situation is quite different from the time election results were announced three weeks ago when Sena snubbed BJP. Following the intervention of Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Uddhav had knocked on Pawar’s doors. After several rounds of discussion, Pawar took the lead on government formation with a brand new political construct by speaking to Sonia. Her trusted aide Ahmed Patel was deputed for negotiations, and it led to the draft.In Video: Final call early next week, Congress-NCP, Shiv Sena finalise draft CMP","Maharashtra News: Congress-NCP, Shiv Sena finalise draft CMP, final call early next week",3912,2.300613497
3527,0,"The Dr Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi power sharing arrangement that has governed India for the last nine years is to be taught as a case study in leading B-schools across the world to illustrate the concept of the principal agent problem. In political science and economics, this refers to the “difficulties in motivating one party (the “agent”) to act in the best interests of another (the “principal”) rather than in his own interests.

IIMA’s Professor Carol D’Souza said that first year MBA students studying the conflict of interest and misaligned incentives between corporate management and shareholders find it easier to understand the concept when it is presented in terms of the problems that arose after Sonia Gandhi (the “principal”) hired Dr. Manmohan Singh (the “agent”) as the Prime Minister of India.

To begin with, there seemed to be a perfect convergence of interests: Sonia wanted Dr. Singh to provide good governance and thereby “keep the seat warm” for Rahul Gandhi while Dr. Singh wanted to do the same to bolster his reputation and legacy. However, in due course, Dr. Singh began to lose interest in his job since he seemed to have absolutely no incentives in delivering results. All credit was attributed to the Nehru-Gandhis while Dr. Singh took the rap for missteps, killing whatever little enthusiasm he had to begin with. Consequently, policy paralysis and lack of coordination marred the image of the government, much to the dismay of Sonia.

The problem was further exacerbated, as text-book theory predicts, by information asymmetry: Sonia, like most normal people, can’t comprehend economists’ statements and Dr. Singh is one.

The principal agent problem can be mitigated to some extent by the threat of termination or pulling up the agent in public. Rahul Gandhi, probably realizing what was happening, tried to do that by calling the ordinance drafted by Dr Singh’s cabinet as “nonsense that deserves to be torn up” but in vain. “Things have reached a point of no return,” disclosed a PMO official, “in that Dr. Singh does not give a rat’s ass any more. He simply doesn’t give a shit. The only thing keeping him going is to log as many frequent flier miles as he can before he calls it quits. He is least worried about his party’s diminishing electoral prospects.”

3529,0,"Kapil Sharma, one of India’s most celebrated stand-up comedians, had lost much of his show’s TRP during the Indian general-election period owing to the extremely hilarious comedy speeches Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi used to give in his public rallies. However, as Congress suffered its worst ever defeat, Rahul Gandhi stopped speaking in public and hasn’t spoken inside the parliament yet. Media analysts opine this has brought Indian humor and light comedy fans back to Kapil Sharma and his titular show.

Kapil Sharma had openly admitted back in March that if there was one person whom he considered a threat when it comes to comedy, it was Rahul Gandhi. “I mean, listen to his speeches”, Sharma said, “they’re so hilarious that I never stood a chance against him. I have, to this day, no idea how RaGa came up with such mind-blowing jokes. He’s just amazing because he doesn’t even have to prepare a bit. If Congress had won the election and he had started speaking more often, I’d considering retirement.”

But luckily for Sharma and other comedians for whom stand-up comedy is their means of livelihood, RaGa has now stopped giving public speeches. Colors TV had accused AajTak and other news channels of robbing the user base of their popular show “Comedy Nights with Kapil” by repeatedly telecasting Rahul Gandhi’s speeches. But TimesNow had rejected their accusation as baseless and far from reality saying they never used RaGa’s speeches to boost their TRP as they had their own dark-comedian in Mr.Arnab. “We never ever, ever ever, never never ever misused RaGa’s power of inducing laughter riots,” the channel’s heavily influenced statement made it clear.

BJP spokesperson told The UnReal Times that their party wished to have Congress as the main opposition party and RaGa to be the leader of opposition so that a humorous ambiance will be created inside the parliament. “Everybody wants to have some light time after a serious session,” he added, “what better way to relax than listening to RaGa speak at the end of every session? It sure lightens the mood and relaxes everybody. I tell you a humorous speech at the end is a must after a long day’s work.”

Colors TV rivals are contemplating starting a comedy show with RaGa and Digvijay Singh as its main hosts. Zee TV’s strategic head Varun Bhatnagar says, “Imagine RaGa and Digvijay Singh on the same stage. Give them a solid subject to speak about, say RSS or ‘secularism’ or ‘women empowerment’. I’m sure it’ll be one hell of a laughter riot. Would anyone even consider changing the TV channel? I’d watch its tenth re-telecast also.”",Kapil Sharma gains back traction as Rahul Gandhi stops giving public speeches,2611,1.838376101

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the opposition performing better than expected in Haryana and Maharashtra elections, Congress has decided to seal an election alliance with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) for Jharkhand assembly elections, putting to rest the indications of breakup after the Lok Sabha rout.The alliance, sources said, is likely to be clinched without much fuss and would be finalised before the process for assembly polls gains momentum.Sources said the initial talks between Congress and JMM have removed the post-LS confusion and resulted in an in-principle decision on election partnership.The discussions on seatsharing would start soon. Congress would be the junior partner to JMM and may settle for 25-30 seats in the house of 81. Uncertainty looms over JVM of Babulal Marandi joining the fold though talks are on with the party.In the LS polls, BJP swept the state across regions, decimating the “grand alliance” of JMM-Congress-JVM.While BJP is seen as positioned way ahead of its rivals for the assembly contest, the opposition is taking hope from the performance of Congress in Haryana where it ran the ruling party close. Even in Maharashtra, where NCP and Congress were seriously hobbled by lack of personnel following months of defections to BJP, the opposition was not decimated as was expected by the ruling camp.The lessons drawn by opposition strategists from the recent assembly polls are that electorate may be differentiating between national and assembly polls, and that BJP can be challenged in states despite its parliamentary landslide.It is the only source of optimism for opposition whose expectations in Jharkhand were dashed by the Modi juggernaut few months ago.Moreover, like Haryana and Maharashtra, BJP in Ranchi has an unconventional chief minister in Raghubar Das , a non-tribal in what is viewed as a tribal state.The JMM-Congress alliance seeks to mobilise the tribals under the Sorens while hoping to eat away at the OBC and upper caste votes through the national party. The two allies are likely to revert focus to “tenancy law amendments” that the Das government had to roll back under sustained pressure from the tribal agitation.","Congress to seal deal with JMM, be junior partner in Jharkhand",2480,1.85483871
3531,0,"After Wankhede pitch curator Sudhir Naik, it is the turn of Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray to get abused by Team India director Ravi Shastri. In a unique case of the hunter becoming the hunted, Uddhav was accosted by Ravi Shastri in the wee hours of dawn today and splashed with ink for ‘failing to dig up the Wankhede pitch on the eve of last Sunday’s SA-India ODI clash’.

According to stunned Shiv Sainiks, a highly enraged Shastri barged into Matoshree, accompanied by Bhajji, Mishy, Bhuvi, Mohit, and proceeded to give Uddhav ‘the fully Monty’. “He flashed and flashed hard at our leader, Uddhav, and it wasn’t pretty,” a yet to recover Sainik told The UnReal Times about the incident.

Still smarting from the bludgeoning at the hands of de Villiers & co, Shastri and the bowlers have squarely laid the blame on the Shiv Sena. And why not? They have their reasons. After managing to shoo away Pakistani delegates, umpires and commentators, the Indian think tank was fully confident that the Shiv Sainiks would overnight dig up the pitch as well in protest against the participation of Pakistan born leg spinner Imran Tahir. Much to their chagrin, what they found the next day was a pitch as smooth as Priety Zinta’s face with table tennis bounce…and the rest, as they say, is history. Shastri remained unapologetic about ‘throwing the kitchen sink’ at the Sena chief.

The writer sneaked into the Indian dressing room and managed to speak to Harbhajan Singh, who said, “I remember playing that Kotla Test in 1999 when Shiv Sena had dug the pitch,” a still fuming Bhajji recalled. “It was turning square and we all known what Kumble paaji did there. Our very own Mumbaikar team director Ravi Shastri told us that Shiv Sena would dig the pitch as Imran Tahir, a Pakistan-born player was playing at Wankhede. Let alone digging up, they didn’t even roughen it up. The ball was just not turning!”

The Sena later hit out at Team India and Shastri for laying the blame for the team’s inadequacies elsewhere and defended its failure to dig up the pitch overnight. “Now look, we know our cricket like any avid Mumbaikar and don’t need lessons from Shastri,” a Sena leader told The UnReal Times. “Just look at Imran Tahir’s bowling averages. We thought digging the wicket may in fact help him spin it more and given the Indian batting’s inconsistencies, we decided against it.”

Taking a dig at the Mumbai Indians spinner Harbhajan, he said, “Bhajji is a crap. Indian bowlers should learn to hit targets from us. Learn some throws by watching how accurately we throw ink on the faces of people!”

In a related development, Amit Mishra, along with Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Mohit Sharma, later visited the Marine Lines police station and registered an FIR against AB de Villiers for molesting them on the field.",Wankhede flat track: Frustrated Ravi Shastri now lashes out at Shiv Sena for not digging up the pitch,2808,1.994301994

Sonia: Ahmed, enough is enough. I can’t take this anymore. I’ve decided to speak my mind.

Rahul: Wow mom! You’ll give interview? Why don’t you just leave it to Ahmed uncle to inform the media that you are unhappy?

Sonia: No beta. This time it’s different, it’s serious. They say it’s my Bofors. I need to prove them wrong. This is no Bofors.

Ahmed Patel: That would be great ma’am. How will you prove?

Sonia: Simple, I need just two minutes. Bofors deal was for howitzer guns and this is for helicopters. That deal was with army whereas this is with air force…

Ahmed (suppressing a giggle): Oh that kind of interview! Then we need to get the right journalist.

Sonia: Who do you have in mind?

Ahmed: Rajdeep. Bechara, he wouldn’t mind sitting on the footboard of a bus and interviewing. Of course, he will crib for years. But he’ll do it. He just needs a chance to get even with Arnab.

Sonia: Call him.

Ahmed Patel calls Rajdeep on phone.

Rajdeep: Salaam-Alaikum Ahmed bhai. Kya haal hai?

Ahmed: Wa-Alaikum Salaam. Ma’am wants to give an interview on the AgustaWestland issue.

Rajdeep: That’s great Ahmed bhai. You’ve chosen the right journalist. After sense has prevailed over sensation.

Ahmed: Tera yehi bakwaas sun sun ke thang aachukka hun. Ma’am wants sensation. No problem if there is no sense. We want the message to reach people.

Rajdeep: Ok ok ok…don’t get angry. I have a good offer for you. You can reach a large audience.

Ahmed: Offer?

Rajdeep: Haan…buy one get two free. If Sonia ji gives me interview, Sagarika write about in her blog and I will promote the blog in twitter. How does it sound?

Ahmed (irritated): Bhaad mei jao tu aur tera offer. Phone rak!

Rajdeep: Yeh kahan aa gaye hum, yun hee saath saath chalte…Listen to Lata. Gnight, shubhrathri.

Ahmed: (after disconnecting Rajdeep) Ma’am, let’s try Barkha.

Sonia nods her head and Ahmed calls Barkha.

Barkha: Yes Ahmed bhai, kaise yaad kiya? Generally, you call me at the time of deals or cabinet formation. Now you’re out of power…

Ahmed: Sonia ma’am wants to give an interview on the chopper deal. If you could…

Barkha: That’s a good idea. Happy always to help you guys. Can we do this interview day after tomorrow?

Ahmed: Why? Are you travelling?

Barkha: No, no…I’ve checked all the middle class restaurants in Cannaught Place…Narula, Khan Chacha, Nathu’s, Pind Balluchi…all are busy.

Ahmed: What has that do with the interview?

Barkha: Nowadays I shoot interviews only in restaurants. Like Biryani pe Baat and Politics in a Plate, I will do a Sonia’s Such over a Sizzler… Or how about Discussion over Dhokla…Sounds very desi naa? Italian Bahu over Idli-Sambar—still better naa?

Ahmed shakes his head and disconnects the phone.

Sonia: What happened?

Ahmed: She has become mad. We’ve to think of someone else. How about Vikram Chandra?

Sonia (raises her voice): Noooooooo…….

Ahmed: Why? What happened?

Sonia: Poor guy. Vikram reminds me of Rahul. The same pathetic, buddhu look…

Rahul (complains): Mom, you too? Like Subramanian Swamy? This is not fair…

Sonia: I’m sorry beta. Slip of the tongue. I didn’t mean it.

Ahmed: How about Prannoy Roy?

Sonia: He sounds so tired I go to sleep watching his interview. How will I give interview to him?

Ahmed: Don’t worry about that. He can plant a girl in the audience who can ask convenient questions…like…Is it an RSS conspiracy? Or, are the Hindu males plotting against an ablaa naari?

Rahul: Mom, don’t take risk with college girls. Remember what happened to me in a Bengaluru college…you can never be sure about these youngsters.

Sonia (sighs): Hmm…what can we do? We do not seem to have many options.

Ahmed: Shall I try with Bhupendra Chaubey?

Sonia: Does he interview politicians?

Ahmed: Of course he does. What makes you think he doesn’t?

Sonia: No…I thought he interviews only Sunny Leone and…

Ahmed: Ok. How about ‘krantikari’ Punya Prasun Bajpai…

Sonia (irritated): The idea is to clear my name, not to make myself a joke.

Ahmed: Shall we ask Sanjay Hegde to do the interview?

Sonia: But he is not a journalist.

Ahmed: Haan…he is not a party spokesman, still doesn’t he act as one? I suggest we ask him to take your interview and NDTV will telecast anything for us. (calls Sanjay Hegde) Sanjay we want you to interview Sonia ma’am.

Sanjay: But I’m not a journalist.

Ahmed: I know yaar…but you are more than a journalist.

Sanjay: I don’t know who I am. You guys don’t think I am a lawyer. You rush to Singhvi and Sibal with your corruption cases. Agusta didn’t think I could be a journalist when they decided to ‘manage’ twenty journalists. I lose everywhere. You’ve reduced me to a ‘stepney’ spokesman for congress. (a self-loathing Sanjay disconnects the phone.)

Ahmed (exhausted): Shshhhhhh… We have exhausted almost all known anchors. Only Arnab is left.

Sonia: Nooooooooo…Let’s settle for our time tested formula.

Ahmed raises an eyebrow.

Sonia (sighs): Tell the media I am unhappy.

3533,0,"Bigg Boss season 3

Faking News has got exclusive access to the list of housemates for the third season of the reality show Big Boss. Our investigative reporter risked his life to get this list so that our readers’ insatiate needs for more knowledge and wisdom are satisfied. As expected, the list of housemates has got all the required ingredients to make the show controversial and a big hit internationally.

Shiney Ahuja Even though he might have denied it, it has been confirmed that Shiney Ahuja got bail from the court to allow him to participate in the show. Shiney needs a lot of public sympathy and he is expected to cry and faint and ask for forgiveness from every Indian for his conduct. People would be able to forgive him by sending ITSOKBABA as a keyword from their mobiles. It’s rumored that Shiney will not be voted out at least in the first two weeks of the show, so that more and more people can SMS and forgive him. Each SMS will cost just 10 rupees.

Shiney’s maid Yes! A surprise from the highly creative and innovative team of Big Boss, who have often been accused of being dorks for producing an unoriginal show. They have finally convinced Shiney’s maid to come on television and recount her experience. Contrary to what people have seen on television, Shiney’s maid actually has a clear face and not pixilated as seen in the photograph here. It’s rumored that she will have an out of court settlement with Shiney during the show, with 10% of the settlement money going towards the welfare of maids working in Bollywood actors’ houses.

Justice Dinakaran In thick of controversy and corruption charges, Justice Dinakaran is just another surprise packet for the Big Boss 3. Dinakaran is expected to be voted out in the first week itself as he too prefers the same, for he is too busy with legal affairs. But the one week will allow him to connect with the ordinary citizens of India and pitch himself as being a worthy contender for the post of CJI. Big Boss producers are hoping that supporters of Ramdas Athawale will again break their office furniture over Justice Dinakaran being voted out for being a dalit.

Urmila Matondkar There was a time when prefixes and suffixes like ‘sexy’, ‘hot’ and ‘nude’ were added by internet surfers with her name in Google, but now keywords like ‘Himesh’ and ‘make up’ accompany her name. Disappointed with this inexplicable shift and drop in public interest, participation in Big Boss 3 comes as a big relief to Urmila. She’s expected to tear apart Ram Gopal Varma during a hearty chit-chat with Big B. According to lastest reports, Ram Gopal Varma had refused to cast Urmila in his next venture, which is remake of Big B’s blockbuster Mard.

Boochar Tau As the head of the most powerful Khap Panchayat of India and MTV Youth Icon of the Year, Boochar Tau is expected to protect the honor of the show. Tau will be an exception to all the housemates till date as he will not cry, whine or sob during the show, but he’s expected to induce these emotions upon other housemates, especially the women housemates. Boochar Tau is rumored to be the person who’d settle the case between Shiney Ahuja and his maid, but producers have vehemently denied any such development taking place on the show.

Manoj Kumar The veteran actor would complement Boochar Tau on issues of honor and self respect. He’s expected to expose the deadly intentions of China, Pakistan, USA and SRK on the show. It’s widely being speculated that Manoj Kumar will announce his decision to produce a film in partnership with Dev Anand during his stay at Big Boss’ house. Apparently it’s the Indian version of Men in Black with Manoj Kumar and Dev Anand being in the lead roles. There would also be an item number by some Hollywood celebrity in the movie, sources say.

Britney Spears Another exotic addition to the show after last year’s experiment with Jade Goody, who unfortunately is no more on television. But like Goody, Britney too will have an early exit from the show without being voted out by the Indian viewers. According to the script, Manoj Kumar would ask her for a screen test for the item number in his movie and she would oblige by singing and dancing. Apparently she’d perform “hit me baby one more time” and will be hit by Boochar Tau by his lathi (bamboo stick) on head, leading to her emergency exit.

Andrew Symonds While Britney might be out early, to retain the international appeal of the show, Big Boss 3 will see the Australian cricketer-fisherman Andrew Symonds as a housemate. Symonds will try to tell the cricket crazy nation of India how he deserves sympathy despite all the controversies surrounding him. Apparently Manoj Kumar will have a heated exchange with him over the issue of racial attack on Indian students down under and end up calling him a monkey, which will leave Symonds in tears, reminding us of what happened to Shilpa Shetty in Big Brother.

Kalavati After pulling out of the Maharashtra assembly elections, Kalavati, the finding of Rahul Gandhi’s discovery of rural India, has finally decided to become a housemate in Big Boss. The NGO supporting her candidature as a housemate will share the SMS revenues with the producers of the show to further the cause of poor people in the country. Producers claim that they are trying to convey a message to the general public by inducting Kalavati as a housemate – the message that Indian political system needs the provision for a negative vote – just like people vote in Big Boss.

Piggy Another innovative and creative addition by the Big Boss producers. Piggy, the cloned pig, would the first non-human being to star in any version of Big Boss in any part of the world. The producers claim that they are trying to convey yet another message around the world – that Swine Flu has got nothing to do with sweet little pigs – and it will be proved so, with none of the housemates getting the deadly disease at the end of the show. Like Shiney Ahuja, Piggy too will not be available to be voted out for the first two weeks of the show.

Meera The Pakistani actress’ inclusion as a housemate is another attempt to add international flavor to the third season of Big Boss. Meera is expected to divulge secrets about her controversial marriage and how she was asked to apologize and pay a fine for kissing an Indian on screen. Meera could further court trouble as experts foresee further fine levied on Meera for cohabiting with a pig (Piggy in particular), which is a haraam animal according to Islamic tenets. Meera is excited over the prospects.

Baba Ram Rahim While most people believed and speculated that it would be Baba Ramdev as a housemate in Big Boss season 3, our investigative team has learned that it’d be another spiritual guru, the controversial Baba Ram Rahim of Dera Sachcha Sauda, who would participate in the show as a housemate. Baba Ramdev had apparently refused the offer as he’s already signed another reality show where homosexuals would be treated live on television through yoga. Inclusion of Baba Ram Rahim is expected to push the TRPs in Punjab, Haryana and Canada.

Munaf Patel Yes, there will be two cricketers as housemates this time (Andrew Symonds being the first one). Munaf is expected to share his experiences as a part of the Rajasthan Royals team and cry over the last year title loss. It’s rumored that Shilpa Shetty will make a special appearance in the show and console Munaf. Bobby Darling, the national transsexual, will also make a special appearance on the show and fight with Munaf for breaking his/her heart. Bobby will publicly ask every viewer to vote Munaf out.",Exposed and Exclusive: List of housemates for Big Boss season 3,7626,1.442433779

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:29 IST

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday urged every household in Jharkhand to contribute at least one brick and Rs 11 for construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, while addressing an election rally in Bagodar, which votes on Monday. The chief minister’s call comes a month after Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site.He said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was responsible for ushering in Ram Rajya . “In one sweep, the PM removed Article 370 in Kashmir. Today, you can go to Kashmir, Ladakh, Jammu, to the land of Ma Vaishno and Baba Amarnath and buy land. If someone has given you that right, it is PM Modi,” he said.He said after abrogation of Article 370, there was no loss of life, despite fear-mongering by Congress, RJD, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and CPI(ML).Commenting on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Yogi said India has never been biased towards anyone on the basis of caste or community, but the situation is the opposite in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “Minorities in these countries were thrashed and thrown out, their women exploited, their properties looted. They came to India looking for refuge and the government has granted them citizenship,” he said, adding opposition parties who were opposing this bill were speaking the language of Pakistan.“They are objecting to sheltering poor and harassed people and speaking in support of illegal immigrants who are looting your rights. Should we accept Pakistan’s language? Should these parties get your votes,” he asked, adding if someone has no respect for Ram, one cannot be friends with them,” he said.Seeking votes for BJP, Yogi Adityanath said parties like Congress, RJD, CPI(ML) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha only worked for themselves. “They instigated terrorism and Naxalism.

3540,0,"After his election campaign in UP earlier this year, Robert Vadra kicked off a similar campaign for the upcoming Gujarat assembly elections. The campaign will be in the form of a motor-cycle rally through the Western state with stop-overs for functions.

The Nehru-Gandhi jamai started his campaign by paying a visit to the ancestral home of Mahatma Gandhi at Porbandar. As he emerged after paying respects to Gandhiji and got onto his Suzuki Boulevard 1800 cc motorcycle, the media scrambled to get some sound-bites. Here are excerpts:

Reporter: “Sir, why did you pick up Gujarat for your campaign?”

Vadra: “Well, I am the son in law of the Gandhi family. So it makes perfect sense for me to campaign in the land of Gandhi.”

Reporter: “Sir, will you join politics?”

Vadra: “If people want, I will certainly contest from the land of Gandhi.”

Reporter: “Why motorcycles?”

Vadra: “The thumping of the superbikes is to open the ears of the Narendra Modi government which has become deaf to the suffering of the masses.”

Amid the scramble around Vadra, our Unreal Times reporter managed to interview two of Vadra’s page three friends as well.

Reporter: “Sir, why did Vadraji choose to campaign in Gujarat of all places?”

Page 3 friend: “I just told Robert that there was no way I was going to risk my Hyosung superbike on the roads of Rai Bareli or Amethi. If he wanted me in, it had better be Gujarat.”

Another friend riding a Ducati said, “If you need to enjoy super biking experience, Gujarat’s roads are the best.”

The rally took its first halt at Rajkot where Robert Vadra inaugurated a gym and followed it up with a hard-hitting speech against the Modi Government.

Pointing at the advertisement hoarding for the gym, Vadra declared, “BJP is unfit to rule. Vote for a fit Congress government.” Flexing his pectoral muscles, he added, “Gujarat needs a strong leader”.

Vadra’s entourage stopped over at Ahmedabad where Robert Vadra, in a hard hitting public speech, tore into Narendra Modi’s tall claims about making Gujarat business friendly. He said, “My land deals in Haryana and Rajasthan were approved and completed in 2 days flat. I have started a process of buying land in Jamnagar a week back and still the deal is not complete. Modi is lying and misguiding people with false claims of speedy projects approvals. Respectable businesses like DLF are unwilling to invest in Gujarat precisely because of this red tape.”

He added, “In Congress party, no one is above the law. When charges were leveled against me, Finance Minister P. Chidambaran, who has so many more important things to do, personally went through my tax records to prove my innocence. Compare this with BJP where no single leader has even bothered to go through Mr. Gadkari’s tax records, leaving that thankless job to a sidey like Gurumurthy.”

From Ahmedabad, the rally proceeded to Vadodara where Robert Vadra gave a seminar titled “The spirit of entrepreneurship – lessons for the budding entrepreneur.”

Surprisingly, the auditorium was already filled to twice its capacity with more people jostling to come in. An overjoyed Congress leader said, “Vadraji has given such seminars in other states too but we have never seen such an amazing turnout. In some places, we had to round up idle people and pay them to attend this seminar. But today, we will have to start turning people back as there is simply no place left in the auditorium. Now I am sure that Congress will sweep Gujarat polls.”

Meanwhile, as the organizers started turning back people from the seminar, they got agitated and violent at the prospect of missing Vadra’s seminar. Extra policemen had to be called in to control the situation. Even BJP leaders were shocked at this sudden spurt in support for Vadra, their confidence giving way to panic.

If there was an invisible pro Congress wave, we at The Unreal Times wanted to be the first ones to pick it. Our correspondent spoke to a lot of the glum looking entrepreneurs who missed out on Vadra’s seminar to try and understand why the Gujarati business community had taken such a fancy to Vadra.

Here are some opinions from a cross-section of Gujrati voters on why they admire Vadra and wanted to attend his semiar:

Bharat Rathod, a garment manufacturer from Mehsana: “Only a Gujarati can appreciate the importance of converting 50 Lakhs to 300 crores in 3 years.”

Tulsi Parikh, a diamond trader from Surat: “That he did this amid the global economic slowdown is really commendable.”

Ashish Shah, a restaurant owner from Kalol: “My banker tells me that I can at best get loans at 10 percent interest with my credit rating. I wanted to learn from Vadraji how to improve my credit rating so as to be eligible for Zero percent interest rate.”

Narendrabhai Parmar, a manager from a company in Halol: “Due to high amount of development, it is difficult and also expensive to get skilled people in Gujarat. I just wanted to know how Vadraji managed to set up such a successful venture with just a handful of employees.”

A chemistry professor and an amateur alchemist, Rasayanbhai Chemicalwala: “I want to learn the secrets of alchemy from Vadraji, particularly the conversion of brass into gold.”

After the seminar, Vadra’s supporters proceed to the main office of the Vadorara Municipal Corporation and handed over a petition demanding that the city of Vadodara be renamed as Vadra.

The seminar ended with Vadra being treated to a sumptuous helping of aamras, made from preserved mango pulp gleaned from the orchards of Valsad. “Umm…my family just loves mango people, err I mean mango pulp,” he said, as he took a second helping.",Motorcycle diaries of Robert Vadra’s election campaign in Gujarat,5643,2.073365231

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Maintaining that the BJP had the support of all 54 NCP MLAs to form a government in Maharashtra, the Centre on Monday asked the Supreme Court for two to three days to file a reply to the plea against the governor's decision to invite Devendra Fadnavis to become chief minister.The Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP has filed a plea against Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari's decision to swear in BJP leader Fadnavis as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.The Centre told a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna that the governor had in absolute discretion invited the largest party to form government on November 23.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court the Maharashtra governor is not supposed to conduct a roving and fishing inquiry to ascertain which party has numbers to form government.The question is, he said, can a party come and seek the court's intervention to hold floor test within 24 hours.Mehta said the governor was cognizant of the facts and the situation after poll results that had led to President's rule being invoked in the state.The apex court, after perusing Koshiyari's letter inviting Fadnavis, said it has to be decided whether or not the chief minister enjoys support on the floor of house.The solicitor general explained that the governor had invited Shiv Sena , BJP and NCP for government formation and President's rule was imposed only after they failed.As the hearing began on Monday morning, Mehta submitted letters of the governor and Fadnavis as asked by the bench on Sunday.The apex court said it is not considering the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress' combine's plea that they be invited to form government in Maharashtra.","Maharashtra politics: Have support of all 54 NCP MLAs to form government, Centre tells SC",1896,1.793248945
3548,0,"The disastrous results in Varanasi cantonment polls make it amply clear that the Modi wave has died down. If sections of the populace are still not convinced, here are 10 points that may help them come around to the irrefutable fact.

India losing 2-0 in Australia: India lost to Australia despite Virat Kohli and Murali Vijay’s fine form and the absence of Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma in more than one Test. The boys were clearly affected by the pernicious effects of the deteriorating Modi wave.

Lack of snow in Kashmir: Last year, it snowed right on time in the Kashmir valley, thanks to the strong Modi wave prevailing in the country. No such luck this year. The valley remains devoid of snow, disappointing the visiting tourists. This, coupled with the recent election results of Jammu & Kashmir shows that the Modi wave is unable to carry either votes or clouds to India’s northernmost state.

Ashutosh spelling words correctly: AAP’s superstar on Twitter, during the peak of the Modi wave, murdered every possible word in the English language. But now, he strings together typo free and even grammatically correct sentences in his tweets! The Modi wave on Twitter is nowhere as disruptive as it was once.

Ravi Shankar Prasad no longer demanding resignations: At the peak of the Modi wave, Ravi Shankar Prasad was at the peak of his powers too, demanding resignations left, right and center on the National TV debates. Howev er, months have passed now without him demanding a single resignation. Th is cannot but be a symptom of the terminal decline of Modi-wave.

Rajapaksa losing Sri Lanka polls: When the Modi wave was at its peak, leaders from across South Asia came in droves to bask in it, and click photos with the man of the moment. Sri Lankan premier Mahinde Rajapakse struck a friendship with Modi, and the two often resolved prickly issues over late night phone calls. Seeking to ride the wave, Rajapakse called for snap polls, but ended up suffering a shock defeat. It is now evident that the Modi wave couldn’t save his friend.

Chetan Bhagat’s book not doing as well as expected: Chetan Bhagat, India’s best-selling author and a Modi fanboy has reportedly seen a drop in sales in his book. Since Chetan’s storyline and writing is impeccable as ever, the only blame that can be attributed to this weaker than expected performance is the diminishing Modi wave.

TCS sacking people instead of hiring whole campuses: A company that earlier used to bring trucks to campuses and hire engineers of all shapes, sizes and CGPAs is now actually firing people. Yes, read that again. TCS is firing its developers. Such a thing would have been inconceivable during Modi’s peak. That’s how much the Modi wave has weakened.

Modi not following any new handles this New Year: Every New Year’s day, for the past four years, Modi would follow dozens of new Twitter handles. He would do so because he was confident of gaining enough new followers to maintain his followers-following ratio. This New Year, however, Modi did not follow any new Twitter handles. Clearly he doesn’t expect to gain new followers at the same rate, which in turn, shows that he himself believes the Modi wave has died down.

Sambit Patra replacing Jha as Arnab’s bashing bunny: At one point of time, Sambit Patra was hailed as a great spokesperson. Okay, that might be stretching things a bit. But let’s just say he wasn’t Arnab’s primary bunny. Sanjay Jha was. 7 months after Modi’s victory, Sambit Patra has pretty much taken over Sanjay Jha’s spot, and is getting bashed left right and center in The Newshour. To add insult to injury, Sanjay Jha occasionally makes sense these days. Clearly, the Modi wave is not able to save its spokespersons anymore.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday accused the BJP-led government of monumental mismanagement of the economy, saying it has moved from "" recession to crisis mode"" and the fiscal deficit was far more than the estimates.Addressing a press conference here, party leader Anand Sharma said the government in its second term was expected to address problems of agrarian distress and give a boost to the economy but there has been a crash in production, the collapse of demand and huge number of layoffs.He said sectors passenger vehicle sales had come down by 23.7 per cent in September.""Capital goods formation, if it was hovering around zero for the most part of this government, now it has collapsed and is the lowest since 2012. The manufacturing has hit a five-year low. There is a contraction in industrial output. It is minus 1.1 per cent,"" he said.Sharma said capacity utilisation of factories was not above 60 per cent, which has led to a large number of retrenchments in sectors such as auto, textiles and leather which are all labour intensive.He said the auto ancillary sector, where India is a global leader, has also been badly hit.""Not only the numbers are shocking but we know the government has failed to deliver despite fall in commodity prices since 2014. The windfall gain of this government only from petroleum products has been more than 2.6 lakh crores per annum,"" he said.Sharma said if about Rs 10 lakh crore of GST refunds , refund to exporters and unpaid bills of PSUs are added than ""fiscal deficit is not 3.3 per cent it is beyond 8 per cent"".He said direct and indirect collections were nowhere near the half-way mark.""The government is guilty of monumental mismanagement of Indian economy. We are staring at a huge revenue shortfall. Where will the GST come when factories are shutting down and production has been scaled down by factories. When you have complete collapse of all four engines of Indian economy, we can only term it as a crisis,"" he said.Sharma said the credit flow to the commercial sector has come down by 88 per cent.""It is unheard of in Independent India.

In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

The story had barely begun to die down when word got out that the Congress Party has embarked on a similar drive to find Rahul Gandhi a bride. As one party elder put it, “Gone are the days when you could say that you are celibate in service to the nation. This is kalyug! If you are in the public eye and not married, the public assumes you are gay. That may work in America, but in India, it is not good for your electoral chances! Besides, it is Sonia Madam’s wish that before our Rahul Baba is crowned prime minister, we should find a Sati Savitri to take a seat beside him on his rightful throne.”

Our sources report that a high-level committee chaired by senior Congress leader and Rahul Baba’s mentor, Digvijay Singh, was swiftly formed and put into action. Committee members included party faithfuls, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Jairam Ramesh and also, for his experience in bride-hunting, Shashi Tharoor.

Following intense deliberations, the committee presented Sonia Madam with a list of Top 10 criteria for an ideal Gandhi bahu. Let it be said, you saw it here first!

Top 10 criteria for Rahul Gandhi’s bride:

10. She must be well versed in modern Indian history. (Rahul Baba’s father is Rajiv Gandhi, whose father is Feroze Gandhi, who is unrelated to the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi.)

9. She must know Hindi or, like Sonia Madam, have the ability to master new languages as an adult. (Rahul Baba likes to talk to aam aadmi in Hindi and can’t have his wife wondering whether he’s talking to Mango Man!)

8. She must be “convent-educated” and know that a diphthong isn’t some thong dipped in water. (Rahul Baba is Raul to near and dear ones, and we can’t have anyone butchering his pet name!)

7. She must love Italian food and know how to pronounce it. (Rahul Baba is half-Italian – duh! – and loves ordering pizza.)

6. She must be strong enough to carry a heavy duffel bag while travelling. (We don’t talk about it much, but Rahul Baba does not like to check baggage at airports.)

5. She must have the ability to remember routes and schedules of local trains. (Rahul Baba likes to ride them on a whim, and even his handlers often can’t keep up.)

4. She must be able to ride a motorcycle. (Rahul Baba likes to ride pillion as he visits aam aadmi. See also, Hindi requirement above.)

3. She must not be a fan of high heels. (Rahul Baba likes to go on padyatras, also known as long, meandering walks across varied, uneven terrain.)

2. She must be a practitioner of yoga. (Rahul Baba likes to show up unannounced for dinner at modest Dalit homes, and his wife can’t show discomfort while sitting cross-legged on the floor.)

1. She must stay away from modeling for towels. (The last Gandhi bahu who did that didn’t quite get along with her saas, and Rahul Baba’s relationship with his mother is important to him.)

BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday hailed the Lok Sabha election results as a testimony of people choosing politics of performance over politics of ‘dynasty, casteism and appeasement’.

“After the sixties, democracy in this country was under the grip of dynasty politics, casteism and appeasement. It is for the first time in 2019 that the country has pushed these things out of politics and has reposed faith in politics of performance,” he said addressing the NDA Parliamentary Parliamentary in the Central Hall of Parliament after election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as leader of the NDAPP to head the government again.

Shah thanked all the allies and the MPs for unanimously choosing Modi as prime minister again and said, “This euphoric mandate is massive and historic. After 1971, for the first time, a Prime Minister is returning to the post with an even bigger majority after completing a first five-year term.”

He also asserted that Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister of the country exemplified the spirit of the constitution.

“After Modi became Prime Minister, the poorest of Indian felt that the spirit of the Constitution can turn into reality and a person from poor background become Prime Minister. It was a Narendra Modi experiment when people wanted him to replicate the development model of Gujarat in the whole country. This experiment of people has been successful.”

Shah outlined various people-centric initiatives of the NDA governments first term and said, “The 50 crore poor who were looking for their place in the country’s system were previously not able to find it. In the five years, Narendra Modi has uplifted the 22 crores poor of the country and it is their blessing which has come as this historic mandate.”

He also talked about the surgical strikes, while criticising those who questioned it the first time.

“When the first surgical strike happened, people felt that a government has come which can answer the country’s enemies inside their homes. Initially the defence pundits of the country called surgical strike as a fluke but after Pulwama attack the air force personnel’s took the revenge through air-strike”, said Shah.

Shah also said that it is people’s expectation to see India emerge as a world power and hopefully same will happen in the second term of the Modi led NDA government.

Earlier during the NDA meeting, Narendra Modi was elected as the leader of the NDA.

He was greeted by SAD’s Parkash Singh Badal, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar, BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari after being elected as the leader of NDA and BJP at the NDA meeting.

Modi-led NDA swept the elections and won 352 out of 542 seats in the 17th Lok Sabha elections. In the official count, the BJP has secured 303 seats, 22 more than in 2014 elections. (ANI)","‘Modi uplifted the poor of India, this historic mandate is their blessing’: Amit Shah",2882,1.769604441

Impressed by Shastri’s ability to be reassuringly staid and always on the message with metronomic precision, McKinsey’s Jason Chandler, Senior Partner from the firm’s Sydney office, invited the 1984 Champion of Champions, who recently completed 10,000 mentions of ‘flashes and flashes hard’ in international cricket commentary, over for a case interview.

The Unreal Times presents transcripts of the case that Shastri cracked to bag the coveted job at the firm:

Jason Chandler: Hi, Raavi, thanks for coming over to interview with us; must say your commentary has grown on me over the years and I have come to enjoy the punditry you bring to the table.

Ravi Shastri: Thanks, Jason. It’s much more than punditry. I would call it Shastrigiri – the fine art of using clichés to deconstruct and describe complex periods of play for the benefit and edification of millions of viewers.

Jason stares back awestruck, before regaining his composure

Jason: Why, that is fantastic, Shastri…I mean Raavi. We expect our consultants, as premier thought leaders, to be at the forefront of coining new business phrases to analyze the world of business, and thus, life itself.

Jason quietly ticks off a box from a list of “Must have attributes in a consultant” and mutters to himself “the guy can talk with a straight face, dresses sharply and has a ‘I’m a cool dude’ look about him. Just need to check if he ticks the box against ‘cracking a case interview’”.

Shastri (to break the silence): Its quite an electrifying atmosphere out here, Jason

Jason (slightly taken aback): Er..yeah. Ok, Raavi, I’ll give you a relatively simple business problem to solve given that you are no ordinary candidate. A leading international beer company has just entered the Indian market, but has been struggling to grow. The CEO has hired McKinsey to advice him on how to increase his market share. Assume you have been deputed on behalf of McKinsey to advice him. What are your first thoughts?

Shastri (almost instantaneously): Just get the feeling that this could go down to the wire, Chandleri

Jason: Uh..please call me Jason. But yeah, you are right. Go on.

Shastri (in his best monotone): As the captain, he’s got to mix it up, Jason. Experience will be invaluable on Indian conditions, and you’ve got to believe in yourself

Jason: Absolutely. He must believe in the product. What strategy would you suggest to him?

Shastri: Branding is the key, Jason. No half measures there. He’s got to flash and flash hard. And I would recommend he take the aerial route when it comes to distribution. He must know where the top line is, if his growth is to shoot up like a tracer bullet.

Jason: Hmm. Interesting… What do you think would be the result, if the CEO were to actually take this advice and implement it? Would his market share grow, reduce or stay the same?

Shastri: At this stage, all 3 results are possible, Jason. In the end, McKinsey is the real winner.

All the partners gaze at each other and nod. Then they all stand up and start clapping in unison

Jason: Brilliant! You’re absolutely right Raavi, it just doesn’t matter what the result is! You have understood the consulting business to a T!

Jason (picks up a microphone, and stands at the doorway to address the rest of the candidates): Ladies and gentlemen, we have had a cracker of an interview. Over 30 candidates have been interviewed. Over 300 questions have been asked. And in the end, one person held his nerve and proved to be the winner. Congratulations Ravi Shastri!

Overjoyed that someone had paid tribute to his signature style of commentary in this manner, Shastri removes his shades to wipe the tears of joy streaming down his gaunt face.

Jason (shaking Shastri’s hands): Before we end Raavi, do you have any questions for us?

Shastri: Yes (pauses)… Do you like Indian curry?

The former Indian skipper will now substitute the microphone for a laptop and will be working with a confectionary company in Adelaide to help them increase market share.

Shastri’s career change has been welcomed by his colleagues in the commentary box although Ian Chappell seemed a trifle begrudging. “Well, Raavi will make a fine consultant but what I don’t get is why they did not select me when I interviewed with them a couple of years back! I have more experience, I am tactically shrewder, I can communicate better, I even had better CGPA at college! Not fair that he makes the cut just because he is better looking than I am,” whined Chappell.",Ravi Shastri cracks McKinsey case interview; to retire from cricket commentary,4796,2.773144287
3557,0,"Anderson may be guilty of offences graver than “pushing and abusing” Sir Jadeja, which is a level 3 offence under the ICC Code of Conduct. The England fast bowler allegedly failed to address Sir as Sir during the course of a colorful exchange of views. Anderson may face a mere two Test ban for the first offence but if found guilty of failing to address Sir Jadeja by the requisite honorific, he could be slapped with a life ban. “It’s a very grave charge, one that completely goes against the spirit of the game. This could spell the end of Anderson’s career, I’m afraid,” an ICC lawyer opined.

The disturbing incident allegedly took take place during India’s second innings when Anderson managed to get Sir’s prized wicket and proceed to give him a send-off. However, in the process of telling him where the pavilion is, Anderson failed to add ”Sir” at the end of the robust exchange. Sir walked away in a huff, seething with rage. The Indian dressing room reacted with shock after Sir informed them of what had transpired. “Colorful exchanges are fine, these things happen. But Anderson crossed the laxman rekha in not addressing Sir as Sir. After the internet knighted Sir, even the potty-mouthed Aussies have been scrupulous about addressing him with respect,” a member of the Indian camp disclosed.

With the alleged altercation now threatening to snowball into an even bigger controversy than the infamous Monkeygate incident, the ICC has flown in a special lawyer to mediate between the two sides. The English Cricket Board (ECB) for its part is completely backing Anderson. “Jimmy is incapable of behaving so ungraciously as to fail to accord the respect that is due to Sir Jadeja in light of his legendary exploits with both bat and the ball. The truth, according to Jimmy, is that there was a lot of background noise when Jimmy was telling Sir where the pavilion was and the ‘sir’ part may have been lost in the din. Jimmy is devastated that such grave charges have been leveled against him and he is determined to clear his name through due process. The ECB fully stands behind Jimmy,” the official ECB press release stated.

Considering that Anderson’s career now hinges on the legal outcome, the Indian team is being cajoled into withdrawing the charges and only pressing ahead with the relatively lesser offence of “pushing and abusing” Sir Jadeja.","Charges against Anderson graver than initially reported, he may have failed to address Jadeja as Sir",2365,1.649048626

After England skipper Joe Root revealed they won’t be shaking hands with their Sri Lankan counterparts in their upcoming two-match Test series, the England and Wales Cricket Broad (ECB) have gone a step further and asked players to refrain from ‘any unnecessary public engagements’ on the tour. The two teams are scheduled to play two Tests in Sri Lanka — first Test in Galle starting March 19 and second Test in Colombo starting March 27.

The ECB urged players to avoid taking selfies and signing autographs for fans amid coronavirus outbreak which has gripped the entire globe. In their bid to keep the players away from virus, the England board asked players to keep their distance from fan engagements. They also urged the fans to ‘maintain good levels of hygiene’.

“Whilst we acknowledge that this will be disappointing for some supporters, we stress that this a measure to protect the ongoing wellbeing of the England Test squad and is a decision which has not been taken lightly.

“In addition, England players and staff are also being instructed to avoid shaking hands where a ‘fist pump’ or a personal greeting will suffice. Players will no longer participate in handshakes with each other or the opposition,” the statement added.

Earlier, skipper Joe Root had stated his team will not go for fair play handshakes on their tour of Sri Lanka, amid coronavirus threat. This came in the aftermath of England players being hit by gastroenteritis and flu problems on their tour of South Africa recently.

3559,0,"A day after BJP cabinet minister from Madhya Pradesh, Kailash Vijayvargiya remarked that women who cross their Laxman Rekha will face consequences just like Sita crossed hers and was kidnapped by Ravana in the Indian epic Ramayana, he was summoned to the quarters of party president Nitin Gadkari for a one-on-one session. What transpired during the meeting? The UnReal Times correspondent Bharat Sanghi brings you the transcript:

The camera zooms in on a confident Vijayvargiya striding towards Gadkari’s office. He spots veteran BJP leader LK Advani emerging from Gadkari’s office and walking in his direction.

Vijayvargiya (cheerfully): Good morning, Sir!

LK Advani: Here to meet Nitin? Haha! This reminds me so much of my school days, when I’d get called to the principal’s office. It was terrifying! (pauses mid-step, as if something just struck him) Actually, I think I should blog about this. Chalo, all the best, bete!

The smile vanishes from Vijayvargiya’s face. His confident gait slows down. He reaches into his trousers to pull out a handkerchief and wipes the beads of sweat on his forehead. He gazes upwards, folds his trembling hands, stammers ‘Hey Ram’, and tentatively knocks on Gadkari’s door. The door opens abruptly. A Domino’s Pizza delivery boy steps out, smiles at him and darts past him. Vijayvargiya peeks into the room, and to his surprise finds Mrs. Sushma Swaraj.

Sushma Swaraj (bellows): Arre, aise chor ki tarah kyun dekh rahe ho, Kailash bhai?? AAO ANDAR! Aaj hum tumhari mangal aarti karne wale hain!

Vijayvargiya gulps, trips over the door’s frame, and falls down. “Sambhal ke bhai, sambhal ke,” says a rather soft male voice to his left. On all fours, he turns and finds a pair of gigantic legs tapping the ground rhythmically. His eyes slowly trace upwards, past the bare legs, the gigantic thighs, the rather taut khaki shorts, the enormous torso, to the cherubic face of BJP President Nitin Gadkari, gorging on a slice of Domino’s Cheese Burst pizza, molten cheese dripping from the slice onto his shorts.

Sushma Swaraj (loudly): Arre, aap aaraam se pizza khaayiye, Gadkari ji! Isko main sambhaaloongi!

Nitin Gadkari (chomping on the slice): No, no Sushmaji. Aap jaayiye, main dekhloonga isko.

Sushma Swaraj takes a deep breath and proceeds to throw a bloodcurdling stare at Vijayvargiya. Luckily for him, she is interrupted by a Hare Krishna ringtone on her cellphone. She makes her way out of the room, dancing to the bhajan. Vijayvargiya sighs stands there, motionless. Gadkari adds oregano seasoning to the remnant portion of his slice and feasts on it for a few seconds.

Nitin Gadkari (eyes closed, sways in pleasure as he chomps on): Mmmmm…Aaahh! Yummmm! (opens his eyes to find Vijayvargiya staring at him) Oh! Tum! Aao aao, beitho!

Vijayvargiya (trembling): N..n..nahi Sir…t..t…theek hai…

Nitin Gadkari: Abe, yeh kya Manmohan Singh ki tarah theek hai, theek hai kah rahe ho… BEITHO!

Gingerly, Vijayvargiya lowers himself and seats himself on the very edge of the chair.

Nitin Gadkari: Hmm…pizza khaate ho kya?! cheese burst hai …Ekdum jhakaas!

Vijayvargiya: N..Nahin Sir… aap khaayiye!

Nitin Gadkari: (looks relieved) Okay…one minute, let me wash my hands and get some Diet Pepsi…

Vijayvargiya: Okay Sir (looks here and there, pulls out his handkerchief to wipe his forehead).

Nitin Gadkari (comes back, places one can of Diet Pepsi on the table, opens another one and takes a long swig before turning back to Vijayvargiya). Arre, itna pasina kyun choot raha hai bhai? AC chalaun kya?

Vijayvargiya: Nahin Sir ..nahin Sir ..rehne dijiye ..main theek hoon..

Nitin Gadkari: Okay (stretches his arms, rolls up his sleeves a bit and lands a good natured slap on Vijayvargiya’s shoulder) Toh bolo, Kailash bhai, kaise ho aaj kal?

Vijayvargiya: Theek hoon Sir

Nitin Gadkari (takes a sip of Diet Pepsi): Good. Kya karte rehte ho free time mein?

Vijayvargiya: err …free time mein, Sir…T…TV dekhta hoon Sir! TV!

Nitin Gadkari: Wah! The idiot box, hmm….kya dekhte ho TV mein?

Vijayvargiya: Ra ….Ramayan, Sir!

Nitin Gadkari: Excellent! (tries to take another swig from his can, realizes it is empty, and flings it out of the window) Chalo, thodi der TV dekhte hain !

Gadkari reaches for his remote and switches the TV on. CNN-IBN anchor Sagarika Ghose appears, interviewing Digvijaya Singh on his response to comments by various BJP leaders. Gadkari changes the channel. This time, it’s Barkha Dutt, who, close to tears, announces that Javed Miandad has cancelled his trip to India.

Nitin Gadkari: Oh! Miandad nahin aa raha hai! Kailash bhai, pata hai Miandad kaun hai?

Vijayvargiya: Umm…woh..woh …Pakistan cricketer Sir?

Nitin Gadkari: Haan… aur Dawood Ibrahim ka rishtedaar bhi! Dawood Ibrahim pata hai kaun hai? Wohi jiska IQ Swami Vivekanand jitna hai lekin kaam bilkul alag! HAHA! (bursts out laughing)

Vijayvargiya: Yes Sir. Hehe (joins in the laughter nervously)

As Vijayvargiya titters, Gadkari stares at him. All of a sudden, with an agility belying his size, he leaps forward and grabs Vijayvargiya’s face by the jaw.

Nitin Gadkari (stares at Vijayvargiya’s lips): Arre…yeh kya hai? Itni dryness?

Vijayvargiya (terror-struck): Sir…Sir..

Nitin Gadkari: Ek minute… mere paas ek acha sa lip gel hai… usko lagata hoon

Vijayvargiya (by now pale): Sir, please.. Sorry..Sorry..

Nitin Gadkari: Abe yaar ..fikar mat karo…. this is not Sagarika Ghose’s lipstick. Lip gel hai, dryness ke liye.

With what appears to be something other than lip gel, Gadkari draws a thick white line across Vijayvargiya’s lips from left ear to the right, and lets go of Vijayvargiya’s face.

A rather pale Vijayvargiya looks at his reflection in the mirror.

Vijayvargiya: Sir…yeh.. yeh..

Nitin Gadkari (look at him via the mirror and mutters menacingly): Har insaan ka ek laxman rekha hota hai, Kailash bhai. Us line ko cross nahin karna chaahiye.. samjhe?

Vijayvargiya opens and closes his mouth uselessly, unable to comprehend what just happened.

Nitin Gadkari (slams his fist on the table): SAMJHE?!?

Vijayvargiya (breaking into fits of sobs): Y..y..y…yes Sir…

Nitin Gadkari: Good… ab main teen tak ginunga. Uske pehle yahaan se kat lena! EK! DO!..

Vijayvargiya leaps up and rushes towards the door, tripping once again over the door’s frame. He doesn’t bother to get up and crawls on all fours until he gets round the corner, after which he gets up and runs for dear life, past a rather surprised Sushma Swaraj.

Sushma Swaraj (entering Gadkari’s room): What was that? (spots Gadkari’s fist bleeding and shrieks) HEY BHAGWAN! Your hand, Gadkari ji! Ramlal, doctor ko bulao! ABHI! ISI WAQT!

Nitin Gadkari: Chodiye na, Sushmaji… just a scratch… main theek hoon.

Sushma Swaraj (reluctantly walks out): Theek hai …take care! Let me know if you need anything!

The two leaders stare at the NDTV headline “Major blow to Modi as Gadkari injures fist”, shake their heads and chuckle. Sushma exits. Nitin stares fixedly at his table for a second before…

Nitin Gadkari (bellows): RAMLAL! DHOKLE LAO! Aur woh Rajasthani.. kya naam hai uska…Banwari Lal Singhal ko andar bhejo!

Ramlal: Jee Sir!

Now Kejriwal will be conducting recruitment drives in various MBA and Engineering colleagues of Delhi and would hire individuals in bulk.

When we went to confirm this with Kejriwal, he said, (strictly off record) “We realize that our senior members were not being productive and were creating a lot of trouble. We have taken motivation from one of the most successful industry of India i.e. IT industry. Just like them we have laid off( forced out) few of our senior members and would hire trainees in their spot. This will be a win-win situation for all the people as these trainees would be doing what they are told to do and would not be using any additional mind of their own which can cause trouble to us and along with that we will also be improving the employment percentage in Delhi as we know most of the MBA and engineering students are jobless.”

When asked about senior leader’s future, Kejriwal said, “they are experienced people, they can get a job anywhere easily. They might get even higher package and other perks in companies like BJP and Congress.

“Advani ji will announce the dates and venue of the Chintin Shivir in his blog, which will formally launch our march towards achieving a hat-trick of general election losses,” a BJP leader told Faking News.

“What’s the point of winning elections?”

Party sources confirm that after losing the 2004 elections – the reasons for which are known only to Sir Ravindra Jadeja, though many political experts claim to know the same – BJP decided to focus on developing core-competency in making Congress appear marginally better in comparison on the national level.

“Our strategy worked and we lost in 2009 too!” one of the poll strategists of the party recalled, “Despite terrorist strikes, cash for votes, and economic slowdown by the UPA-1, we managed to convince the voters not to choose us.”

“However, Congress decided to raise the bar as UPA-2. They have managed to look far worse – so much of corruption, arrogance, thoughtlessness, and general bullshittery all around. We have a big challenge to make them appear marginally better,” the strategist explained why a Chintan Shivir was needed.

The Shivir will find out innovative ways through which BJP can meet their target of third successive defeat in the general elections.

“We will have various discussions and sessions during the Shivir. Sessions such as ‘How to lose votes to Kejriwal’, ‘Has Manmohan Singh resigned yet?’, and ‘Rahul Gandhi jokes’ are being organized,” a BJP leader revealed.

“There is no discussion or session planned to elect a Prime Ministerial candidate,” the leader added, “Keeping the confusion going about the PM’s candidate is one of the key factors that we believe will help us lose the next election.”",BJP to hold Chintan Shivir to find new ways of losing another election,1967,1.881037112

Pundits have termed it as the closest India will probably get to closure for 26/11 and have bracketed PM Singh’s speech with Obama’s address to the nation in the aftermath of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden.

Sitting at his desk in the PMO with a photo of Gurcharan placed in the background, Dr. Singh stared purposefully into the cameras to brief his fellow countrymen about details of Operation X. The tone was somber, the demeanor serious, the resolve steadfast. Here are excerpts from his historic address:

“Good evening. Today I can report to the Indian people and the world that the prison authorities at Yerwada conducted a successful operation that has killed Ajmal Kasab, the LeT terrorist who was responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent men, women and children in Mumbai four years ago.

As we all know, Ajmal Kasab was convicted and sentenced to death after a painstaking, 2 year long, judicial process that was stunningly swift by Indian standards. After that the case went into limbo as Kasab’s mercy petition gathered dust on the desk of the President.

Then, in November, President Mukherjee miraculously rejected his mercy petition and the operation picked up steam.

Today, at 7:30 AM, I woke up and logged on to my twitter account under the handle @PMOIndia to discover that Kasab had been hanged.

As I was kept in the dark, the jail authorities at Yerwada prison launched the targeted operation at 7:30 AM. A small team of Indians carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Indians were harmed.

Later, I called up President Sonia to inform her about the successful operation and we both agreed that this is a historic day for our country in the fight against terrorism.

Tonight, I want to thank all the countless bureaucrats and ministers who worked tirelessly to expedite the processing of Kasab’s mercy application, especially Union Minister Shinde whose alacrity in signing off on Kasab’s file is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the Indian people.

I must also thank President Mukherjee for his professionalism and courage in quickly acting on Kasab’s petition.

Of course, we are not any safer from terrorism emanating from across the border since the dastardly events of 26/11/2008 but when did that ever worry us.

With this, I end my address. May God bless America..oops I mean Jai Hind.”

To take forward his image makeover as the angry, righteous man of Indian politics to its logical conclusion, The UnReal Times presents five ideas that, with a little help from his fawning Congress colleagues and that paragon of selflessness Dr. Manmohan Singh, will confer upon Rahul a stature rivaling some of the tallest leaders in Indian history.

UPA okays an ordinance ceding Kashmir to Pakistan; Rahul tears up the ordinance:

Under the leadership of Dr. Manmohan Singh, the UPA cabinet draws up an ordinance ceding Kashmir to Pakistan elegantly justifying it with words such as peace, trade, tranquility, friendly relations etc., and sends it over to the President. While the President ponders over it, Manish Tewari calls for a press conference. Three minutes into his holistic defense, Rahul Gandhi leaps from the first floor of a balcony overlooking the podium, and lands right on top of Manish Tewari. With bloodshot eyes, Rahul hollers that this ordinance is nonsense and he will not condone ceding territory to execrable Pakistan. With tears in their eyes, the nation’s youth stand and applaud patriot Rahul’s nationalist sensibilities.

Government allocates 10,000 crores to corruption in Union Budget; Rahul tears up the budget speech:

Finance Minister, P Chidambaram explicitly allocates a substantial sum to commissions, kickbacks and various other avatars of big ticket corruption, eloquently arguing that since corruption is anyway an undeniable reality, it might make sense to explicitly budget for it and thereby take a step forward towards limiting it. Five seconds into Chidu’s follow-up quote from the Bible, Rahul Gandhi leaps from his seat onto the table, reaches Chidu in a blur of motion, snatches his budget speech and tears it to shreds. As the principal opposition watches awestruck, anti-corruption crusaders across the country wonder if they may have got a new messiah to show them the way.

Robert Vadra attempts to fix another deal with DLF; Rahul Gandhi destroys the contract:

Real estate shark tycoon Robert Vadra and his friends from DLF and the Haryana government go on a biking expedition countryside. Vadra stops at a random location, smiles devilishly and says, “Nice place. I’ll take it.” Nodding hastily, his DLF friend draws up a sanction letter for a zero percent loan, and his friend in the Haryana government draws up the papers for the mutation of the deal, when suddenly out of nowhere, Rahul Gandhi parachutes into the area, snatches the papers from dumbstruck officials, crumples them into a ball and swallows it. After washing it down with some Thumbs Up, Rahul Gandhi says, “This is nonsense!”

CBI gives clean chit to Dr. Manmohan Singh in Coal scam; Rahul Gandhi tears up the clean chit:

After a thorough investigation, CBI declares that there isn’t enough evidence or reason to pursue the probe on those accused in the Coal scam, and proceeds to give a clean chit to them one by one. Just when the CBI spokesperson gets to Dr. Manmohan Singh and is about to announce his innocence, an enraged Rahul Gandhi storms towards the spokesperson, grabs the clean chit from his hands and rips it into pieces. The journalists break into spontaneous applause, the loudest applause coming from Dr. Manmohan Singh himself.

Congress sends Sanjay Jha to defend UPA in NewsHour; Rahul beats him up:

For the umpteenth time, Sanjay Jha appears on Newshour, mouthing irrelevant inanities at some times and outright bullshit at others, even as a frustrated Arnab Goswami holds his forehead and screams, “You are not answering my question, Mr. Sanjay Jha!” Thirty seconds into the drivel on one such night, Rahul Gandhi suddenly appears in Sanjay Jha’s panel, roars like the Hulk himself, and proceeds to club a terrified Sanjay Jha to within an inch of his life. He then pushes the unconscious form of Sanjay Jha off his seat, takes his place and answers Arnab’s, and therefore the nation’s, each and every question to the point.

During an interaction with Congress party workers and assorted Rahul Gandhi loyalists, the Union Rural Development Minister found himself on the backfoot and turned contrite. “I agree I f***ed up,” Jairam told hurt members of the Rahul Gandhi fan brigade. “No question of it, my statement has hurt the entire party and if you want me to apologize, I will apologize.” The MIT trained Minister also went on to credit Rahul Gandhi for asking him to apologize. “I spoke to Rahul after I made those remarks and he told me that what I said was nonsense. I am grateful for Rahul once again showing me the right path.”

Jairam Ramesh’s controversial remarks had triggered disquiet across the country with hot-headed members of the TNYC picketing the house of Bangalore based Ramesh Ramanathan, an I-banker turned social worker who runs the NGO, Janagraha. Later Ramesh Ramanathan said he was expecting the attacks. “With a name like that, and with Bangalore being so close to Chennai, I knew I was toast, yaar,” he told The UnReal Times. Chennai based Tennis great, Ramesh Krishnan, was also accosted by some disgruntled TNYC youth, according to reports.

In related news, the UPA regime is mulling a new scheme “Rajiv Gandhi Rahul Gandhi Bhashan Suno Yojana”, under which anyone who can sit through five minutes of Rahul Gandhi’s speech will get Rs. 500 and a voucher to have biryani at any restaurant of their choice. “It is a brilliant scheme that admirably combines the twin goals of poverty alleviation with Gandhi family marketing. First, only the truly desperate will want to avail of the scheme, thus minimizing targeting errors. Second, we can hope to fill venues for Rahul baba’s rallies to at least 35% capacity after spacing out chairs,” a senior Congress leader privy to the scheme revealed.

Key members of the outfit trickled into the meeting room one by one, resolve evident on their faces. They took their seats around the conference table, engaging in nervous small talk as they waited for their mentor.

The year-long speculations about the fate of one man were to be put to rest today. The decision that would inevitably be taken today was likely to send ripples across the fraternity.

Modi’s fate would be sealed today.

The chatter in the room came to an abrupt halt, as a bespectacled elderly gentleman entered the room.

The man was a giant in his own right; a man to be reckoned with, having had sway over the organization for several years, singlehandedly shaping the narrative and direction of the organization.

Of late, however, he was increasingly perceived as selfish and ill-motivated. His extraordinary defiance, despite the overwhelming tide against what he believed in, had alienated his fans. The negative press about him hadn’t helped his or the organization’s cause. His colleagues now secretly admitted that he was beginning to be a liability for the outfit.

Would he or would he not take the bold decision on Modi? This was the question on everyone’s minds. It was all in his hands. His wish would be the organization’s command.

“Well?” he demanded.

A member cleared his throat nervously. “Er… sir, I think it’s about time he got what he deserved. I think you should go ahead and announce it,” he ventured.

“Announce what?” barked the old man.

“Um… whatever you think is right, sir,” the member quickly backtracked, not having the nerve to upset his senior.

The room relapsed into silence for a brief period.

“I am just wondering,” began a skeptical member. “How much support does he have in real life? His primary strength seems to stem from social media, where he goes on tweeting about every single thing on earth and with his select band of followers, carries on a hate campaign against anyone who takes him on.”

The old man seemed to agree with this assessment, for his features palpably relaxed, alleviating a bit of tension in the room.

“Exactly,” he said. “Does he have any support at all outside the internet?”

“We have some recent evidence that he does have a reasonable foothold in the north-western parts of the country,” pointed out Arun Jaitley.

“That may be so, but is it significant enough to avoid doing the right thing?” shot back the old man. “Let’s not forget what’s at stake here – the fate of the organization; perhaps the very future of this country. We must do what is necessary.”

Jaitley nodded in agreement and fell silent, as did the room.

A member, who had hitherto been silent, suddenly spoke up. “Boss, this is our only chance. It is now or never. This might spark a huge controversy, but we have to take this gamble. We have to give Modi his due. He has been asking for it. Make no mistake, should we choose to avoid giving him what he deserves, the organization will suffer, and we’ll all be blamed for its eventual destruction, and taken to task by the powers that be.

Clearly discomfited by the member’s plain speak, the participants fidgeted in their seats.

At this point someone knocked on the door. The old man walked up to answer it. A rotund face sporting a toothy grin peeped in. “Shukla ji!” greeted the old man, out of earshot of the others.

Congress MP, Rajiv Shukla, leaned closer to the old man, and whispered into his ear. “Let’s e-seal his fate,” and disappeared as quickly as he’d come.

The old man shuffled back to his table slowly and sat down heavily in seat.

“Gentleman,” he intoned. “The moment has come.”

“We have argued. We have fought. We have had our differences, but the time has now come, for all of us to stand united for the sake of one man. Modi!” thundered the patriarch.

“Wow,” muttered a member under his breath. “This is big!”

“Your unity has reassured me,” continued the bespectacled statesman. “As far as taking this risk goes, enaku risk edukkardhu ellam, rusk saapadra madiri,” he asserted in Tamil, and bit into a piece of crunchy rusk on his plate. [Translation: ‘Taking a risk is as simple as eating rusk for me’]

“Oh my God, he’s actually gonna do it,” muttered a member hands cupped over his mouth. Arun Jaitley, overcome with emotion, wiped a tear off the corner of his eye.

“On behalf of the BCCI, I, N Srinivasan, hereby order that Lalit Kumar Modi be handed a life ban, with immediate effect.”

The members broke into spontaneous applause. Jaitley rushed to the President and enveloped him in a bear hug.

The erstwhile acting head of Delhi left for Hawaii hours after most Exit Polls predicted an outright AAP victory.

“I don’t know what came over him. One moment he was sitting at the edge of his seat watching the news, biting his fingernails. The next minute he started jumping up and down like a crazy man, then rushed into his room, shoved a few clothes into a handbag and fled out of the house,” said a bewildered Mrs. Jung.

The Lt Governor was later clicked in Hawaii, wearing shorts and a floral shirt, and checking out the birds while sipping on a martini.

“Goodbye to this thankless job! Woohooo!” screamed Jung, when The UnReal Times rang him up for a quote. “For a while, the opinion poll projections and the way the campaign was going really worried me. I thought we’ll end up with another hung house and I’ll end up governing it for another few months getting called Ambani agent, Modi agent and what not. But the Exit Polls put paid to all that. And when Today’s Chanakya predicted a decisive majority, I knew my ordeal was over!”

“Now Arvind can sit on the CM chair and govern that dumb state while I sit on this hammock and while away my time” Jung signed off.

Despite the exit polls projections, Jung still remained the target of the Aam Aadmi Party, even after he reached Hawaii. “The Jung sud answer who paid for the Hawala vacation !!!

3570,0,"Initially, BCCI mandarins were quite eager to push through a proposal for restructuring global cricket administration including two divisions in cricket, more share of revenues by the big three and so on. However, they have modified requirements, given the dire straits to which the Indian ODI team has plunged, not winning even one of their last seven overseas ODIs. At the same time, given that the cricket World Cup has been scheduled in Australia/New Zealand next year, the BCCI has made just one request from ICC: the defending champions, India, will play a part of all their matches in Australia or New Zealand as the case may be. However, the Indian innings will happen only in India. Suppose, India are playing Australia. Then if Australia are batting first, the innings will happen in whatever ground in Australia. Once that is completed, the teams will adjourn to India and the Indian innings will happen and India will chase the same score.

Explaining the rationale, BCCI head Mr N. Srinivasan said that this is nothing new. World over, the Indian IT companies have introduced the Offshore model. By this, all work does not have to happen in the same high cost location. Australia may be good in batting under their conditions and India are good in batting in Indian conditions. The global delivery model makes sure there is a team in India that does all work, when the clients in US are asleep. Same way, when people in Australia are asleep, the Indians will bat.

Clarifying the logistics, Mr Srinivasan said that India is even willing to chase in all matches. To save time, the top 5 batsmen of the Indian team will be permanently stationed in India and their fielding done by substitutes, permanently placed in Australia. Opposing team will start at 5.30 am IST and finish their innings by 9 am IST. Then the players will take a flight and come to the Indian venue. They are expected to reach India by late afternoon. By 6 PM the Indian innings will start in India and the match will be completed on the same day.

This would help the Indian batsmen, as they will think as if they are playing the World Cup in India and play more confidently. It is true that the bowlers will be impacted by jet lag. However, Mr Srinivasan hinted that if anything, the bowlers may do a better job with a slight jet-lag.

Given how successful the on-site/offshore model is in the IT industry, Mr Srinivasan said that BCCI should have pushed for it much earlier. He said based on their performance, we can look at this in other matches as well as in tests.

It is learnt that India does not have to bat at different grounds. For the sake of simplicity, the matches will be held only in Rajkot, Indore and Bangalore, where Indian batsmen have scored individual double centuries.

BCCI said that to facilitate this, they will also buy a Boeing 747 that can transport the teams without any loss of time. BCCI considered an Airbus A 380, but it did not fit in with the ground strategy as it cannot land near Rajkot or Indore.

Welcoming this move, Cricket Australia said, “It is the most exciting development in cricket since the IPL. By playing across time zones and three countries, we are having a real world cup.” They are also relieved that BCCI will not boycott the world cup under the new arrangement.

Australia captain Meg Lanning says the defending champions’ rocky road to the Twenty20 World Cup final against India has them ready for the “biggest game” of women’s cricket in Melbourne on Sunday.

Since losing their tournament opener to India, the hosts lost talismanic all-rounder Ellyse Perry to injury and scraped through a string of do-or-die games, including the rain-hit semi-final against South Africa, to reach the Melbourne Cricket Ground decider.

Lanning said the testing campaign had them in good stead to take on Harmanpreet Kaur’s undefeated India.

“It hasn’t been an easy road to the final but I wouldn’t have had it any other way,” Lanning told reporters at the MCG on Saturday.

“We’re sort of match and battle-hardened, really.

“The last four games have been cut-throat, must-win clashes ... and we’ve had to deal with that pressure and the need to stand up when you’re under the pump.

“I’ve been extremely proud about how the group’s handled that.”

Australia, long the benchmark of women’s cricket, will bid for a record-extending fifth T20 World Cup title in front of a huge crowd at the 100,000-capacity stadium.

Organisers hope the attendance on International Women’s Day might set a record for a women’s sporting event.

“To know that game day’s tomorrow, we’re involved in the biggest game of women’s cricket that’s been, everyone’s just looking forward to the occasion,” said Lanning.

“I always dreamed of being involved in this game when I saw it was at the MCG and they were hoping for a big crowd.

“We’re not coming here just to put on a show, we’re coming here to win, that’s the attitude we’re going in with.”

Australia were comprehensively beaten by the Indians in the tournament opener at the Sydney Showgrounds, their batswomen struggling against the wrist spin of Poonam Yadav, who took 4-19.

Lanning said their would be plenty of practice against slow bowling at training and that “all options were on the table” in terms of selection changes, pending a review of the MCG pitch.

Although Australia were yet to play their “best game”, Lanning said there was little need for major changes.

“I think we’ve shown that we’re able to cope and be really calm under pressure and that’s what’s going to be needed tomorrow,” she said.

“Often in finals you don’t need to go above and beyond what you’ve already presented. It’s actually just about producing that again and making sure you do the basics really well.

“Especially early in the game when there are a lot of nerves flying around, that’s going to be really important.

“I think the team that settles the quickest will give themselves a really good chance in this game.”",‘Biggest game of women’s cricket’: Australia captain Meg Lanning ahead of final against India,2889,2.146071305

5:30 AM: Woke up to a refreshingly clean Delhi thanks to AAP’s push for clean governance. Do you remember the ‘35 officers arrested’ ads across all national newspapers last year? Corruption ceased to exist in Delhi after that.

7:30 AM: Checked with Gopal Rai ji and Satyendra ji if they were going to office. Today was my turn to take the car to office. We all carpool and follow odd-even even though it’s not mandatory.

9:00 AM: Running slightly late at work. The notifications on my twitter handle have reduced this morning as I have not yet tweeted since night. Ashutosh, Khetan and others call to check if I am doing fine. They say that I am keeping them off work by not giving them a single tweet to retweet. Ashutosh was especially worried as he uses a borrowed laptop. I promise to get into action soon.

9:45 AM: Reach office. With a view to speed up governance, I ask all my ministers to appoint their wives and children as volunteers in the Government on the condition that they will not ask for pay, perks or office. Gave a concession and allowed them to take shared government transportation to work, if available.

10:30 AM: Begin my day at work officially by tweeting through my official Twitter account. Four tweets back to back. First tweet on Modiji, second on LG ji, third on CBI ji and fourth on Delhi Police ji. Only 1 has Modiji reference. Yet these people say that I am besotted by him. 6 retweets done too. Modiji stop me if you can. Twitter is not your PMO!

11:30 AM: Call up my principal secretary. He didn’t pick up. Gosh! He is in jail. I call up a senior clean officer I have known for several years and ask him to join Delhi government. He is posted in Andaman. I ask him to report to Delhi CMO immediately. He says that it is not the protocol for appointment. He starts listing rules but I ask him to not worry about it. After all, we are here to change the rules. Political revolution has started. Bharat jaldi badlega.

12:30 PM: Receive media clippings from unbiased newspapers and news portals highlighting Delhi government’s work. Our internal survey has already revealed that only honest media enterprises in the country publish AAP’s achievements. All others are sold out. I retweet several tweets to let people know about the wonderful work done by Delhi government. 224 honest citizens ‘like’ it while 336 corrupt ‘Bhakts’ abuse within 20 minutes.

2:00 PM: Order for lunch. I am shocked to see Gujarati thali in my cabin. Modiji is trying to take over my life. I tweet asking people if it is true!

3:00 PM: Receive invitation to participate in Dharna outside Home Minister’s house. Decline it by saying they should contact the new kids on the block, Hardik Patel or Kanhaiya, instead.

4:30 PM: Seek updates from the “Interns”, earlier called Parliamentary Secretaries, on their respective Mohallas. These secys run across the city from pillar to post and gather details about hospitals, etc. in the city for free throughout the day.

5:30 PM: Just saved 150 crores for government by striking down the request to build a flyover. Roads already exist, why add burden to benefit contractors and others? Construction is the root cause of corruption. Most contractors are Modi agents.

6:00 PM: Shoot off a letter to LG asking him to file fresh enquiries and FIRs against Delhi government. The whole secretariat wears a deserted look at this hour. Met Satyendra ji in the pantry making his own tea. PM Sir Modiji has paralyzed an elected government like never before. Worse feeling than being in President’s rule. Spend the next few minutes flying paper planes in the cabin for FREE while Modiji flies abroad spending crores of public money. Judge who’s saving and who’s wasting!

6:30 PM: Vishu of #KVNasha fame and Ashu of #Kanshiram fame pick me up to go to theatre to watch a Hindi film. If you are wondering how I get time to watch movies, the reason is Modiji. He makes sure to keep me off work, especially on Friday evenings. So, I just found a way to utilize the time. I ask my driver to take the other ministers in my car.

8:00 PM: Request Vishu to stop singing his own parodies during the interval of the movie and ask him to approach Vishal instead. I tweet a #ProudOfYouAshu tweet when he informs me that he is writing his autobiography The Ashutosh and the Secret Behind 83B (@ashutosh83B).

9:30 PM: Visit Bengali Market for Paan pe Charcha with my intellectual friends including Ashu and Manish. A concoction of Kattha and Choona invigorates minds. Someone tweets our photo. ‘Likes’ pour in. We are fully democratic and let people know what we are doing at all times. No secrets here!

10:30 PM: Reach home. Watch TV with family. I am just a common man after all. My favorites are re-runs of Raghu’s Roadies and other Krantikari news channel stories.

11:15 PM: Dinner is served. Another tiring day fending off Modiji comes to an end.

Accordingly, they have taken inputs from the product owners of Hotspot thermal imaging, Hawkeye, the ball tracking system, and Snickometer to introduce the following changes:

1. There is a lot of interference for the signal from the batsman. It is not only with the tapes, but also stuff like pad, trouser and gloves worn by the batsman that cause problems. A Hotspot representative said that all these are intentionally used by the batsman to mask the hotspot. While players of other games wear shorts or mini-skirts, only in cricket they wear trousers. He has recommended that batsman should be dressed as little as possible. He has recommended that all batsmen carry a bat and are dressed in swimming trunks, to get accurate decisions.

2. This still leaves the bat open for manipulation. The recommendation is to subject batsmen to airport grade security before going out to bat. The ICC is seriously exploring options to have the batsman undergo a full body frisking and put the bat through equipment similar to the metal detectors. This will ensure no foul play with the bat.

3. Snicko technologist has said that they would need a larger microphone to capture and amplify the audio. So a small audio booth will be erected around the batsman, stretching from silly point to short leg. This microphone would enlarge the signal.

4. Cock-eye, the fourth generation algorithm, which, among other fancy things, will also solve the Schrodinger wave equation of the travelling ball to estimate the probability of the red-cherry, which as we all know is also a wave, hitting the stumps, while plotting its trajectory. This should put to rest scurrilous speculation about the accuracy of ball tracking trajectory and improve accuracy of LBW reviews by 1000%.

5. While agreeing to these suggestions, the ICC is also supposed to be in touch with the SETI group. SETI is the program for Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, where large telescopes are focused on outer space to capture a signal for aliens. The ICC has requested SETI to focus one telescope onto the ground playing international matches, every time. The SETI group will charge $100,000 per day for deploying a satellite but the increase in accuracy will be well worth the price.

Finally, all these fancy technologies will be topped by a simple GUI which will flash “OUT” or “NOT OUT” as the case maybe to make it easier for the likes of Dharmasena. “We are sure he’ll read out the correct decision 90% of the time,” said DRS CEO, Dick Dorsy.",ICC explores DRS improvements; suggests batsmen wear swimming trunks to reduce hotspot interference,2824,2.230878187

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people.","UP govt’s ‘name and shame’ hoardings not backed by law, remarks SC at hearing challenging high court verdict",3165,1.327014218

Yet another Grandslam title and now his tally stands at an enviable 17 and consider this- he is beating players half his age. At 42, Paes seems unstoppable for yet another decade if one is allowed to indulge in hyperbole.

So, on Friday night as the world watched in wonder and showered Paes with congratulatory messages, there was a young man of 87, who watched the match with bated breath (and an oxygen nebulizer) and as Leander lifted the trophy, this man woke up with a rejuvenated spirit feeling as young as ever. In many ways, LK Advani’s and Leander Paes’ career trajectories have so much in common. LK Advani never achieved individual glory, just like Paes who was at best an average singles player. But both excelled at partnerships, Paes- Bhupati earlier and now Paes- Hingis, similarly, Advani- Vajpayee was a deadly political partnership and later his partnership with Modi was equally effective until it soured and Advani found himself elevated to the Margdarshak Mandal.

Paes has had his troubles with Bhupati in remote past in much the same manner that Advani has had with Modi in the recent past. But Paes has managed to defy that and his age to still emerge victorious.

LK Advani after watching the match remarked, ”If Leander can be the oldest man to win the Grandslam, I too can be the oldest youthful PM of India. As such people are losing faith in Modi and Rahul just doesn’t cut it. So, I can be the best alternative choice as PM for the next elections. I will form a new party if BJP doesn’t agree, just like Paes formed a new partnership. And as a tribute to Paes for having inspired me, our new party’s symbol will be a tennis racquet. We will SMASH everyone come the next election. All I now need is a mixed doubles partner who should be a foreigner!”

New York, USA. Following the uproar in India over Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan being held up for around two hours at an airport, the American security officials have finally issued a statement denying any racial or religious profiling being the reason behind the incident. But officials have confirmed that the Indian actor was detained because he indeed was perceived to be a threat to the domestic security, because of his famous stammering.

“When Mr. Khan was asked his name, he told – My name is K K K… Before he could complete his sentence, the junior security official detained him for being a suspect supporter of the banned organization. Later on we watched various interviews and movies by Mr. Khan and concluded that he stammers at the ‘k’ sound, so we let him go. Watching all those movies and interviews could have taken much more time as Indians talk a lot and make quite lengthy movies, but to our credit, we finished the business within two hours.” a security official said.

The homeland security department categorically denied any religious profiling in the incident as they argued that Shahrukh didn’t appear Muslim to them.

“His name surely is pathetic, but he doesn’t wear that tube wrapped turban. He also has no beard without moustache and he doesn’t stink like a goat. No copy of that holy book was found in his luggage and he didn’t ask for a permission to say prayers while being detained. He surely doesn’t look Muslim to us. We don’t profile anybody on religious grounds.” the security official explained.

The department also denied any racial profiling though they agreed that Shahrukh did appear Asian to them and he needed to work on his skin color and accent.

“Yes, he indeed appears very much Indian – a show off and whining boy like most of you. But we do such stuff to celebrities of all origins. I hope you know that one of our junior officials detained the legendary singer and musician Bob Dylan and asked for his identity proof.

Q: Mr. Shinde, congrats on your promotion. What do you think is the biggest challenge as Home Minister?

A: The biggest challenge is to defend our borders. I recently stumbled upon a world map. Every country seems to have a border. I don’t know if you guys realize this. It’s very, very hard to defend yourself when you have borders.

Q: That’s an amazing observation, filled with insight. Why is it so hard to defend our borders?

A: Defending borders is not easy because you tend to have foreign countries on the other side of the border. And they’re always trying to move the border when you’re not looking. For example, I noticed that there are foreign countries in the North East on the other side of our border. I plan to defend that border first. We will be monitoring closely to make sure no one moves the border.

Q: Mr. Shinde, we’re fortunate to have you in this important position. There are some people in the Congress party who are worried about you.

A: Let’s be candid. I think you’re referring to Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal. I think they are worried that I’ll steal their dumbass vote bank. I’m not worried. If I keep speaking my mind, the rest will follow automatically.

Q: You said that you were an excellent Power Minister. Would you like to add to that?

A: You see, Superman is gone. No one knows where he is. Even Batman has been retired by Chris Nolan. I think I’m the only fictional superhero left.

Q: Mr. Shinde, how do you plan to combat terrorism?

A: The biggest problem with terrorists today is that we don’t know where they are. I plan to issue ID cards to all terrorists who enter India. This will make it easier to track them. We will also have a pool of “immediate suspects,” who can be arrested within 48 hours of any attack in case we’re not able to track down these terrorists. Once you arrest someone, people are usually happy and move on with their lives.

Q: Sir, we satirists were worried when Abhishek Manu Singhvi retired from the public scene. But, God works in mysterious ways. He has given you to us. We sincerely hope that people will appreciate your genius some day. Many thanks for speaking to us.

In a separate statement, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has revealed that he now regrets making Sushil Kumar Shinde the Home Minister, describing the decision as “an example of a good-natured prank that has gone too far.”

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 74 as on Thursday.

3586,0,"In the wake of the electoral rout and strong anti-Congress wave sweeping across India – Mizoram may possibly be the honorable exception – Rahul Gandhi launched a mobile application ‘India 50+’, which sets the stretch goal of India’s grand old party achieving the magic figure of 50 Lok Sabha seats in the upcoming general elections.

After the Congress rout, fueled by Namo and AAP’s rise, Congress strategists are staring at its lowest ever tally of seats with some even suggesting that the Congress may be reduced to single digits – Amethi, a few seats in the North East, and a few others across India based on the premise that any realization of a bell curve throws up a few outliers.

Therefore, the launch of Mission 50+ is to shore up sagging morale and achieve the stretch goal of reaching 50 + seats, which combined with AAP’s rise and good showing of other regional parties, may still make Congress a player after the 2014 elections. “We don’t want to get our hopes too high but who knows, maybe Rahul baba may even emerge as the consensus candidate for PM if a third front coalition comes to power at the center. After all, third front coalitions have foisted some very scary chaps like Deve Gowda as PM on an unsuspecting nation,” Digvijaya Singh said.

The mobile app will allow eNREGA volunteers and Rahul fans to touch base, exchange notes, and generally console each other. It will also complement the website India50.com launched a few days earlier.

Diggy also pooh-poohed Dr Kumar Vishwas’s threats of bringing down Rahul Gandhi in his home turf Amethi. “Kumar reminds me of myself so I am fond of him. But he is no threat to Rahul baba. If Kumar Vishwas contests against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi it will be a comedian-turned-politician versus politician-turned-comedian contest,” the former MP CM (yes, can you believe he was one?) said with a twinkle in his eye.",Rahul Gandhi launches mobile app “India 50+” to achieve stretch goal of 50 LS seats in 2014,1880,2.074468085

The tweet was immediately re-tweeted over a thousand times by Congress supporters and trended briefly for a few minutes before getting eclipsed by the trend #PappuonTwitter.

Initially, there was confusion over what the Nehru-Gandhi scion meant with political analysts, self-proclaimed economists and sundry pundits having a field day in interpreting the cryptic tweet. “I think Rahul was flagging environmental issues,” was one line of thought while a minority felt that it conveyed sharp sarcasm, with Rahul displaying his wordplay prowess and capacity for wit. One section of left-liberals were of the opinion that it was in fact a veiled dig at Sharad Pawar or Nitin Gadkari.

Finally, Rahul mentor, Diggy sought to clear the air by clarifying that “Rahul’s tweet was what it was and nothing more ought to be read into it”. Our highly placed source in congress spelled out the sequence of events leading to Rahul’s debut on Twitter: “Rahul baba was watching Maken’s comment on TV about ‘veil of secularism being preferable to naked communalism’ when he switched to Animal Planet and got the epiphany to back up his party-man.”

Maken later clarified that was indeed referring to huge ocean dwelling mammals when he said wheels veils vales whales of secularism were preferable to naked communalism and thanked Rahul baba for dispelling any lingering confusion about what he meant. Manish Tewari later heaped praise on the Nehru-Gandhi scion. “Even I was confused and thought he was talking about veils of secularism but that doesn’t make sense, does it, when one takes a holistic view of it?” he opined.

When asked to elaborate, Captain Cool said, ”I have to be honest here. I am tired of making excuses. I want to retire and start a new career in athletics. The only thing I am good at right now is running between the wickets. I am still the best runner in the side, managing to convert safe singles into cheeky doubles and keep the score board ticking. So I can always try out for the men’s 200 meter dash in the Olympics and win India a few medals.”

Sources close to The UnReal Times have confirmed that Congress party is likely to approach ACP Pradyuman, he of the famous CID series on Sony television fame. Party sources have confirmed that they are waiting for a final go ahead by their party supremo, Smt. Sonia Gandhi to formally request the ACP to help trace the Nehru-Gandhi scion.

A senior congress leader who did not wish to be identified confirmed this development. “We initially defended our Vice President as we thought he would be back in a few days. However, days became weeks, weeks became months. Now we are finding it extremely difficult to defend his absence. I am happy that the high command has finally decided to act,” he said.

When questioned why they are not interested in approaching CBI, NIA, Interpol or even FBI as Rahul is believed to be somewhere in Europe, the leader shot back: “All government agencies are katputlis [puppets] of the Modi government and we do not trust them. ACP Pradyuman has an unblemished record of solving all cases and that too in a matter of hours. He has a great team and I am sure he will be successful in tracing our leader.”

Meanwhile, Captain Amarinder Singh, the former Chief Minister of Punjab, is said to have written an e-mail to Rahul Gandhi urging him to return. The e-mail subject read: “Ek Paheli Leela released this weekend. Please come back, let’s watch it together.”

Mukul Sangma, the Chief Minister of Meghalaya, compared Rahul to Steve Jobs. “Even Steve Jobs took a long break and came to India. He spent a lot of time in the Himalayas. He was a changed man once he returned back to the US. I expect Rahul to do something earth shattering like what Steve did to Apple,” he said.

Subramanian Swamy, a senior leader of the BJP who is known to have better connects than CIA, Interpol and FBI, tweeted, “Pappu is writing a book in Spain. He will return once the colouring of pictures is over.”

Meanwhile, ACP Pradyuman appeared delighted to be awarded the responsibility of finding the Nehru-Gandhi scion. “We haven’t yet been formally approached by the Congress party, but I am told that it will happen soon. It would be an honour to take up this case and solve the mystery. My team has some clues already. We will put all our network behind this case and help Congress trace Rahul,” he said.

When our correspondent asked what sort of clues they have, the ACP replied, “You see Mr. Rahul has fought for women empowerment. I am told he’s busy empowering women in Europe.

With many of its leaders finding themselves embroiled in tawdry sex scandals (sex blogging scandal in case of the Ashutosh), AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal has sought help from none other than the legendary Bill Clinton to deal with perception management. After all, who better than the former American President to coach AAP leaders in the art of not only squarely facing up to these sleazy allegations but turning them into political triumphs?

“These sex scandals show that the AAP movement has now come of age,” Kejriwal told The UnReal Times. “Knowing how popular our leaders are with the opposite sex, Modi and his coterie are now trying to entrap them in these sex scandals. But AAP leaders will only emerge stronger from this ordeal just like Bill Clinton ji did after his affair with Lewinsky ji,” the Delhi CM noted.

Bill has reportedly accepted the offer to mentor AAP and was formally inducted as an AAP volunteer in a simple but elegant ceremony presided over by Kejriwal in Rome. Bill will train the likes of Dillp Pandey and Sanjay Singh in not only rubbishing sexual misconduct allegations in style but also score some brownie points in the process. The former US president has also advised the Ashutosh to stick to tweeting and stop blogging.

Kejriwal will also be conducting moral building and self-control sessions for some of the leaders who are reportedly very frustrated these days. Arvind exhorted his coterie to direct its energies towards fighting the Modi regime. “If the frustration gets to you, please watch a Sunny Leone movie but for my sake, don’t do galat kaam, doston,” he urged his second rung. “If you still want to do galat kaam, make sure it is consensual.

3593,0,"Jodhpur: Famous actor and driving enthusiast Salman Khan has decided to buy a bungalow in Jodhpur to save money. Due to his frequent visits to the Jodhpur High Court in the Blackbuck poaching case, cost of his hotel stays was becoming unmanageable even for the megarich superstar.

No more hotel stays for Bhai

The case against Salman has been going on for the last 18 years and is unlikely to end very soon. Salman has to come and stay in Jodhpur numerous times. Thus, to avoid booking hotels on a regular basis, Salman will buy a house in Jodhpur.

This decision was taken after Salman was called to Jodhpur High Court twice within this month. Over the course of 18 years, Salman, his family, friends, and lawyers have visited Jodhpur hundreds of times. Sometimes for the proceedings inside the court and sometimes for the proceedings that happened outside the court. The combined hotel bill for all of them has exceeded all the collections from Dabangg 1 and 2.

After this news came out in media, property rates in Jodhpur have shot up by 200 % as fans of Salman Khan are trying to buy properties near his new house. This is the first time real estate prices have inflated since demonetization. India’s foremost expert on real estate, Robert Vadra is helping Salman Khan in buying a Bungalow in Jodhpur.

“I have good contacts with the property dealers in the state”, Robert Vadra told Faking News. “I will get a bungalow for Salman and other properties for his fans at a good price. I love helping people out like this.”

It is rumoured that Arbaaz Khan and Sohail Khan will permanently shift to Jodhpur to maintain Salman’s bungalow in his absence. This will also ensure that Arbaaz and Sohail get some permanent work.

Inspired by Salman Khan’s decision, Arvind Kejriwal will buy a house in Dharamsala near Vipassana Centre, Narendra Modi will buy a house in Washington D.C., and Rahul Gandhi will buy a house in Thailand.",Salman Khan buys a bungalow in Jodhpur to save money during his frequent court appearances,1930,1.813471503

So after intense research and analysis, we bring you the list of positives from the recently concluded Investec Test series:

1) Pankaj Singh recorded the figures for the worst debut in Test match cricket. This means we have a backup for Ishant Sharma – a tall lanky bowler, bowling in the 130s, erratic and also ‘unlucky’. The series has also thrown up another prolific Indian batsman in the form of Bhuvaneshwar Kumar.

2) Resurrection of Alistair Cook: It seems as though India have taken the onus upon themselves to make Cook the greatest English batsman. Just when it looked like Cook’s time was up, he has been given a fresh lease of life.

3) The return of Gautam Gambhir: Shikhar Dhawan’s string of failures as an opener paved the way for Gambhir’s induction. And what a glorious return it was!! The Delhi lad with a majestic 4 runs scored more than other top order batsmen in the first innings of the fourth Test. So that was one call by Captain Cool that came good.

4) Moeen Ali’s grand haul of 19 wickets has made the world sit up and take notice. The world of cricket has shown that it is possible to excel without having any talent – of picking up wickets without the ability to spin, flight, vary pace.

5) The series also threw up one of the spiciest untold stories in Indian cricket- the subliminal inconspicuous animosity between Ganguly and Dravid. Now the fans will eagerly wait for two tell-all books- one by the Bengal Tiger and one by The Wall.

6) Usually, the weather plays a spoilsport and thwarts the chances of a result in a cricket match. This Indian team is different. Spectators watched in shock and awe as the Indian team raced against nature to force a result. The sheer frenetic activity by the Indian team left even the rain gods speechless in both the fourth and fifth Tests.

7) The spectators have been saved hours of watching pointless cricket between two teams who were fighting for incompetency. This enabled them to divert their attention to more productive activities, watching movies like Kick and Singham Returns.",Positives for Team India from the England tour,2226,1.976639712

Sources connected to the BCCI speaking to wannabe media pundit PaajivsPunter said that this was the outcome of a hastily convened top secret national executive meeting at its headquarters. It has also emerged that ever since the news of the forecast of the monsoon being deficient trickled to the mainstream media, government officials were wondering what countermeasures could be used to beat the predictions proactively. A top ranking BCCI official, Sabka Lele, did not attempt to dispel these reports at this stage, as told to paajivspunter in an exclusive:

PVP: Sir, is it true that a Virat Kohli led team will tour various Indian states in the monsoon?

SL: The details are still being worked out. Very soon you will hear an announcement from the Government of India confirming this arrangement. Of course, we can certainly say that we won’t have a game in Mumbai. This program is also the reason why a second string team will be sent to Zimbabwe tour.

PVP: What is the motive behind this sudden announcement sir?

SL: What motive shotive? Virat has had a dream run with rain in the IPL all over India and his influence in Bangladesh was there for everyone to see. Why should only a privileged few have access to this water?

PVP: Is there a precedent for such a move?

SL: Haan, our president has only approved this. Our country has a long history of different practices and customs for invoking rain. Don’t you know Tansen was involved with the Raag Megh Malhar? I don’t like it that you are only pointing out our poor charitable organization.

PVP: Have the BCCI looked at ethical practices and funding for this series? Do you think there will be any takers?

SL: (Angrily) Don’t think we’ve not thought of all this. The NGO liberal intellectuals might stage a dharna protesting that we are going to eat into the income of tribal witch doctors and that there might be a PIL to see if if FDI is allowed in this industry but we are going to go ahead. We are planning to trademark this around Virat who can become the face of raincoat and umbrella brands as well. Imagine the amounts we can save with no cloud seeding with this Virat Kohli rain method (trademark pending). People will love it! We can have a tie-up with Bollywood for shoots in the rain and that is an industry which can use our expertise as well. I’m sure Anushka will love this suggestion.

PVP: Do you think the political class will object to this move like IPL 2009?

SL: On the contrary, with this path breaking idea, the governments will be falling over themselves to claim credit and will pay top dollar to stage the series at their home states. Besides, you forget that we have top executives from every political party at BCCI (winks).

PVP: How would this improve Indian cricket?

SL: Look, we have an encashable asset in Virat Kohli. Imagine if India has to save a test match abroad or is in a hopeless situation like the 2003 World Cup final- we can deploy Virat Kohli and save the day. In fact, additional revenue streams can be generated by loaning out Kohli to weaker teams who have to hide their deficiencies under the cover of rain. Any team with an interest of stalling or raining off a match can rent Kohli’s services. Plus, BCCI have got the rights to produce the sequel to The Water Diviner with Kohli and Anushka as the leads during the off season.

PVP: Don’t you think this is an additional financial burden for the weaker nations, especially in this financial climate?

SL: (Thunders) Utter nonsense! Teams are already put off by playing at a high level at the start of their cricketing journeys. We are easing their baby steps in this hard world of cricket, no? Nobody likes to watch a losing team. If they can’t save for the sake of cricket’s future in their countries, it is their problem.

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

For Thugs, aamir will take a break in real life to emulate the interval part of the movie. It seems that Aamir wants to change the spectrum of film making in India and this step will help that cause.

For emulating the break, Aamir will actually go out of house to buy Samosas or popcorn with cold drink, just like the normal audience does in middle of a movie break. According to him, this will add more authenticity to the movie and his fans will realize how much extra effort he puts in all his roles.

Director Victor Acharya is a worried man, as the shoot of the film has been stalled to accommodate Aamir’s request. It is to be seen how many days does Aamir take to resume shooting and judging by his determination it doesn’t seem to be soon enough.","Aamir khan takes method acting to new level, will take break in real life to prepare for interval part of the movie",1459,1.507882111

NEW DELHI: The opening day of Parliament saw Congress voicing its concerns over the government's decision to revoke SPG cover to Congress president Sonia Gandhi , former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.During Question Hour, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue and attacked the ruling government for its pettiness and demanded that the security detail be reinstated.A section of Congress MPs led by Manicka Tagore also decided to petition the President of India and to seek his ""intervention and support"" in reinstating SPG security. Over 40 Lok Sabha MPs signed the letter on Monday and the numbers are expected to rise with Rajya Sabha MPs supporting the cause.Speaking to TOI , Congress general secretary organisation K C Venugopal said party leaders are ""alarmed and concerned"" by the prevailing laxity in security. ""It is shocking that BJP is seeking to take political advantage out of something as essential as security. Security at the entrance of our leaders' house is lax. Even the vehicles they were using have been replaced by over 10-year-old cars .In Parliament, where everyone has access to corridors, Congress president was left unescorted, since her personal security officer is not permitted beyond the main building,"" Venugopal said .While SPG was incharge of overall security for the Gandhis, the Z Plus security detail is now divided between the Delhi Police and CRPF, with the former handling access and reception, and the latter taking care of close protection and the leaders' houses. ""Our concern for their security is because both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were assassinated as a result of security lapses,"" Venugopal said.""One year ago, IB had said Rahul Gandhi was facing threats at the hands of Khalistanis and Naxals. What happened to that threat now? We never played with their security. But since writing to the PM or home minister is pointless because they are party to the decision, we plan to take it to the President,"" Tagore said.","Cong attacks govt for removing SPG cover of Gandhis, to petition Prez",2255,2.128603104

“Had Rajiv not been his first name, I’d have probably complained to the EC or..err..ordered an enquiry into it as usual. But the fact that he shares his first name with one of India’s greatest ever leaders and noblest human beings, I’m sure that it must’ve just been an inadvertent and unintended remark, off the cuff. People named Rajiv can surely not be intrinsically bad. He has even apologized unconditionally for his remark, which shows his good nature, while opposition leaders who harbour prime ministerial aspirations still cannot apologize,” Shinde was quoted saying.

AAP plans to now field Rajiv Laxman in all debates against Congress spokespersons. “Rajiv stands a good chance of abusing the Congress to his heart’s content and getting away with it. He can even abuse Mani Shankar Aiyar and only be praised in return, akin to pulling a tiger’s tail and the tiger purring like a cat,” AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal chuckled,

Not wanting to stay behind in the scheme of things, the BJP has also reportedly decided to demote aggressive spokespersons like Meenakshi Lekhi and replace them with Rajiv Pratap Rudy. “It totally makes sense. As elections draw closer, the aggression and intensity are bound to increase and the Congress is likely to complain to the EC even for every borderline offensive remark we make. In such cases, it may help if the spokesperson saying such statements is Rajiv Pratap Rudy and not Mrs.Lekhi,” BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

The Congress high command has already issued guidelines not to target the likes of Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Rajiv Laxman, no matter how communal or abusive they are. “If you really must retaliate, make sure you don’t take their first names,” the guidelines said.

Sources say that Congress Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Shukla has taken note of Shinde’s statement and is likely to wield greater clout within the party, on the same grounds. Shukla has however denied the rumours and said, “I am very happy as the BCCI Vice-President and have no issues as long as I run the organization with eSrini mama.”

Shinde has, however, denied reports that he had forgiven Rajiv because the latter had bought him free tickets for the first day first show of the movie Rajjo.","Shinde forgives AAP campaigner Rajiv Laxman, says latter’s first name made him do so",2524,1.703645008

“Look, we know what we are up against after reading those #YoBobbysoWhite jokes. It’s probably easier getting Hafiz Saeed all gooey eyed about his Hindu roots and sporting a tika than having Bobby re-embrace his ancestral faith,” RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat conceded.

“But the thing is,” the RSS supremo continued, “there has to be a Punjabi Hindu lurking somewhere deep inside Bobby. I mean, who except a Punjabi keeps a name like Bobby? Anyway, we have over 50 years of experience in this business. If anyone can pull it off, it’s us. We’ll start by screening DDLJ for him as a warm up act. If that goes well, we’ll get him to watch Ekta Kapoor’s Mahabharat and gift copies of Amish Tripathi’s Shiva Trilogy to facilitate a soft entry as the next step in the Ghar Wapasi and take it from there.”

The RSS plans have predictably come in for criticism from secular parties. “Bobby Jindal needs to be reacquainted with India, not Hindutva,” Congress spokesperson, Randeep Surjewala, snarled.

NAGPUR/LATUR: Union home minister Amit Shah and NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday sparred over BJP's use of Article 370 as an issue in the Maharashtra assembly elections Pawar, addressing a rally at Hingna near Nagpur, said his party welcomed the abrogation of Article 370, but the BJP was exploiting it to target Opposition.Responding to the attack, Amit Shah said his party will raise the issues concerning national security.""One cannot get votes by constantly raising Pulwama (terror attack), Article 370 issues. The article was abrogated in Parliament. Today, the leaders of the BJP are asking us our opinion about it,"" Pawar said at Hingna.Shah, earlier in the day, had sought to know whether Pawar and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were in favour of the abrogation of Article 370 or against it.""Parliament abrogated the Article. Only four-five people opposed it. What they (those who opposed) said was that the decision can be taken, but the people in Kashmir should be taken into confidence first,"" Pawar said.""But the rulers today are criticising the opponents by raising the Article 370 issue instead of talking about what they are doing to resolve basic issues of people,"" he added.Why doesn't the Narendra Modi government ""show courage"" to also scrap Article 371 of the Constitution, which bars people from other parts of India from buying land in the northeastern states, Pawar said.""You scrapped Article 370, why don't you show the courage to scrap 371? We will support you...They (BJP) are misleading people in the name of 370, Pulwama,"" Pawar alleged.He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking political mileage out of air strikes on terror camps in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack in February.The former Union minister said the decision to take hard measure to combat terrorism was taken ""unanimously"" by all-party leaders (at a meeting called by Defence Minister) and not by a ""single individual"", he said.""But political mileage was sought out of the valour shown by security forces, which was not right,"" Pawar said.Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not seek to exploit, politically, the victory in the 1971 war, he said.""She gave credit to the security forces. But political mileage was sought ...(after Balakot) and the BJP benefited from it in the Lok Sabha polls,"" he added.Agrarian crisis deepened on the BJP's watch but the government did not pay heed, he said.Pawar also alleged that ""not an inch of work"" was carried out on Chhatrapati Shivaji Memorial in the Arabian sea after Modi inaugurated the work (in December 2016).Countering Pawar at a rally in Latur's Killari, Shah said the issue of national security and Article 370 was ""important"" for the BJP.""Sharad Pawar and leaders of Congress asked me is Article 370 the only issue ...

The issue of national security will be discussed in the polls,"" the BJP chief said.""You run away if you want, we will definitely appeal to people of Maharashtra on the issue of national security,"" he added.""You cannot face us on the issue of development, Pawar Saheb.

“Wow guys, what can I do for you?” asked a groggy eyed and bewildered Varun.

“No, Varun ji, what can we do for you?” responded Dr. Manmohan Singh, anxious to make a good first impression.

“Please at least sit down. You are making me nervous,” cried the young BJP MP, pinching himself to check whether he was dreaming.

“Don’t make us nevoush by ashking ush to shit in your preshence (sic),” chirped Pranab da, not one to lose an opportunity to score valuable brownie points with Varun, much to the discomfiture of the Home Minister. “Do you want shome Roshgullas?

“I think Varun ji would prefer a wholesome South Indian snack. If I may,” sneered Chidu, determined to prevent the delicate balance of power shifting in favour of his Bengali rival.

Varun didn’t realize then that he had been anointed the new Congress president because other members of the first family remain indisposed to manage party affairs for varying reasons: Sonia has gone abroad for treatment and heir apparent, Rahul, who is exhausted after hectic campaigning for the UP Assembly polls, is on indefinite vacation with explicit instructions that he ‘doesn’t want to be bugged while he is chilling out’. To make matters worse, Priyanka also refused to step in and fill the leadership vacuum citing family commitments such as helping ‘the children with homework and gardening’. Pleas to spare young Rehan to call the shots induced Priyanka to abruptly disconnect her mobile, forcing the rudderless party high command to approach the late Sanjay Gandhi’s son.

However, one Congress member who is extremely pissed with the turn of events is Robert Vadhera. “No body even bothered asking whether I was interested! After all, I am the Indian Zardari. What the f***?!?” screamed the first son-in-law, who has now decided to merge his family surname ‘Vadhera’ with ‘Gandhi’ to ensure that he is not over-looked next time the Gandhis go AWOL.

However, the amalgamation could throw up electorally detrimental dynastic names, according to famous psephologist, Jogendra Jadhav. “If Robert changes the family name to Gandhi + Vadhera = Gadhera, he can kiss good bye to the Hindi heartland, Rajdeep. On the other hand, Vadhera + Gandhi = Vandhi (vomit in most South Indian languages) is definitely unappetizing to South Indians. It’s a catch-22 for Priyanka’s definitely-not-better half, I am afraid,” observed Mr. Jadhav on CNN-IBN.

As a compromise, Robert might change his family name to the rather anglicized ‘Gandera’. “Now only people with sick minds will find fault with that name,” said Robert, hinting at the dawn of a new era in dynastic politics.","Varun Gandhi becomes new Congress President after Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka go on indefinite vacation",2856,3.011204482

Amma has acquired a fearsome reputation in the world of business for her ability to slave drive bureaucrats and party workers to launch competitive products and services. It’s even spawned a new academic discipline – Ammanomics – that is now being taught in Harvard. And so, her foray into the tech world with the Amma phone has not just Apple, but the likes of Google and Amazon worried too. Amazon is more worried actually. “Ammazon is the natural next step for Amma given the wide range of products coming out of the AIADMK assembly line,” a tense Bezos told The UnReal Times.

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people.","UP govt’s ‘name and shame’ hoardings not backed by law, remarks SC at hearing challenging high court verdict",3165,1.327014218

He got this inspiration from movies like Damini, Jolly LLB, Kanoon (1960), OMG – Oh My God, No One Killed Jessica, etc.

Mr. Bobby had been practicing law in Delhi High Court for past ten years under an umbrella outside the court. But he hadn’t tasted even a drop of success. He lost cases for all the clients whom he managed to convince in the past 10 years. Of late, he had been surviving on making affidavits, rent agreements, helping with PAN cards and driving license applications, and other such projects.

The movie that changed the way law is practiced in India.

To know the truth behind hiring of this “clap gang”, Faking News decided to conduct a sting operation on him. Mr. Bobby assured a cent percent win to our reporter (acting as a client). When questioned about his credibility as a lawyer and his past failures, he told our disguised reporter, “You need not worry at all about my past. I have learnt enough from my experiences, now I won’t commit any blunder. I have this magic wand in my hand.”

When asked more about this magic wand, he continued, “Learning is in my genes. I try to learn from whatever comes around. These movies like Damini, Jolly LLB, OMG – Oh My God and many others involving lawyers have one thing in common. Can you guess!?” he paused and continued, “In almost all of these movies, a lawyer with no winning record or past experience ends up winning the case when people and police present in courtroom start clapping after his arguments. Well, this was an enough indication for me by God.”

When asked to clarify further, he confirmed that he has hired 30 such guys for Rs. 10 each, per trial, to clap or give standing ovation to him after his final long argument cum speech.

He also claimed that he won his last case using this efficient technique. On our investigation, his claim turned out to be true. Our investigations also showed that the judge of that particular case was also a Bollywood fan. He forgot and paid no attention to Mr. Booby’s illogical arguments as soon as people in court room gave him a long standing ovation. Falling prey to Mr Bobby’s technique he ended up giving judgement in Bobby’s favor.

After Faking News’ revelation of the sting video, Delhi Police has acted and arrested Mr. Bobby and that judge for questioning.

Kejriwal and his supporters now plan to spend the rest of the night outside Tihar jail to demonstrate against his unwarranted release before May 23rd. “We planned to milk this till May 23rd. The magistrate has no right to short-circuit our plans and release him on May 22nd itself,” an irate AAP leader told The Unreal Times.

A few hours earlier, the metropolitan magistrate had rescinded her order remanding the AAP supremo to judicial custody till May 23rd. In her new judgement, the magistrate observed, “Clearly, I was mistaken about Arvind being an aam aadmi. He’s a very special kind of aam aadmi. After getting spooked by the dharna staged by a galaxy of AAP leaders and activists, I feel it was a big mistake remanding Kejri sir to judicial custody. So I order him to be released immediately without needing to pay bail. Also the defamation case filed by Nitin Gadkari stands dismissed. Knowing Kejri sir, he’ll soon be going on another expose spree and the already overburdened justice system will collapse if we keep admitting Arvind Kejriwal defamation suits.”

The judgment was greeted by howls of protests as AAP activists decried the discriminatory treatment being meted out to their leader. “Why is the Arvind being relesed soon when he not pade any bile?” a furious Ashutosh tweeted. Yogendra Yadav, ever the picture of serenity and composure, too was taken aback. “As a law abiding citizen, Arvind is clearly within his rights to continue to be incarcerated till May 23rd as per the original order.

On the other hand, we also need to look into issues of strategic national importance such as cricket,’ explained an obviously harassed-looking Supreme Court judge.

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”",Liverpool in action despite first Premier League virus postponement,4324,1.757631822

3617,0,"In a sensational move that has stunned the people of the country, the UPA government, for the first time, has chosen to name a new structure after Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh, and not Shri Rajiv Gandhi or Smt. Indira Gandhi.

The building, a large, state-of-the-art, multi-storey square hall aimed at promoting peace and harmony by propagating high-intensity meditation, will be called ‘Dr. Manmohan Singh meditation center’ (MMSMC). Congress General Secretary Digvijaya Singh elaborated on the rationale, “We all were eager to name it after Shri Rajiv Gandhiji. But it was the supremely selfless Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, who was adamant that this building be named after our PM. Tears welled up in her eyes, when she said that she was so touched by all the hard work and effort our PM has been putting in running the nation and said that no one deserved the honour more than him,” Diggy said.

“The building will take a day or two to begin operations, as we have to get a new foundation stone made and laid. Usually, there’s no delay because we have a whole godown of stone templates bearing Shri Rajiv Gandhiji’s and Smt Indira Gandhiji’s names, on which we just emboss the name of the building or road or park or area that has to be inaugurated. But in this case, a new foundation stone with Dr. Singh’s name is being made,” Diggy added.

However, there may be more to the decision than what meets the eye. A Congress insider speaking to The UnReal Times under condition of anonymity, said that the family may have been forced to do this for fear of Modi. “Already he has landed a massive blow on Congress by appropriating Sardar Patel’s legacy. Given that Dr. Singh is the architect of liberalization in India, we cannot rule out the possibility of Modi appropriating his legacy as well. So the leadership decided to pre-empt him.”

The PM himself is expected to inaugurate the building in a couple of days and will lead a massive meditation session for 2 hours, along with Art of Living supremo Sri Sri Ravishankar, before signalling the end of the session with the words “Theek Hai.”","Breaking free from tradition, Cong govt names meditation center after Dr. Manmohan Singh",2088,2.394636015

The conclusion was deduced at a local police station in Chandigarh, where forensic and medical teams examined both the pelters and the stones. “We were noting basic physical parameters of the accused and after taking X-rays, we concluded that their hearts are so dense, heavy and hard. In stark contrast, the stones looked less packed and lighter,” an official told The UnReal Times.

3619,0,"New Delhi: Congress and Trinamool Congress hav asked for resolution in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to condemn the Archie comics for killing Archie. Lok Sabha was adjourned earlier this week over the issue, but opposition has planned to raise it again for the whole of next week.

Addressing a press conference today, a Congress MP said, “We want to pass a resolution condemning Archie Comics, as it had killed Archie cruelly. We are totally appalled by this inhuman side of Archie comics and the support it receives from USA. So, we want to condemn them for killing the innocent Archie.”

A Congress leader shared this with us, saying that Archie and Rahulji have lot in common. He went on to say that Archie was an retroactive inspiration from Rahul baba and Archie copied all his styles, which is evident from R (R for Rahulji) printed in all his shirts. What he didn’t say was that Archie had a girlfriend named Veronica.

The demand was backed by many other opposition parties, especially Trinamool Congress, which insisted that this be done even if it was a Sunday today.

The press conference was followed with a protest by Congress MPs led by Rahul Gandhi. Rahul was reading an Archie comics throughout the protest, while Youth Congress leaders burnt Amar Chitra Katha copies.

“Archie sounds like Christian name, and BJP does not want to condemn someone killing a Christian. This proves that NDA is anti-minority,” Congress leader Digvijay Singh claimed.

The issue was raised by many news channels too, with many independent and unbiased journalists wondering if Narendra Modi had started showing his fascist colors after the election victory.

“Modi did not care for the percentage of voters who happened to be Archie’s fan. By this, he has forgot to live up to the mandate people gave him. Just because Archie’s fans are minority, Modi has treated them like how he treats other minorities!” claimed a senior journalist.

Meanwhile Congress has credited Rahul Gandhi as the main force behind this resolution.

When asked by this Faking News reporter for a response, Rahul Gandhi first smiled for two minutes and then said, “Yes. I was depressed by the news of death of Archie in the Archie comics. I cried for hours, until Mommy gave me juice. I said no to any juice, as I have seen protestors saying ‘death to juice’ as juice kills innocents.

Highly placed sources, who were in terrace of hospital, passed us several interesting information about stay of Kejriwal there. One such source said, “Kejriwal came here on first week of March along with his parents and was staying here for the past two weeks. The news reports and even the hospital’s medical bulletin reveals that Kejriwal came to Jindal hospital for sugar treatment. But, it is all fabrications. The truth is, Kejriwal checked in here to learn ‘Sign Language’. The photos that they display in newspapers of Kejriwal doing stuffs here is nothing but learning the sign language.”

When we asked about the reason for Sign Learning, another source, which was standing next to our primary source, said, “Kejriwalji is wary of getting caught in stings. He is now scared of each and every AAP volunteer and member. He is avoiding to talk in mobile phones nowadays. He is asking for thorough check of people visiting him. But, how many days can he continue like this? So, he has decided to learn sign language and will be using that sign language to communicate with people who will meet him in future. He is said to have told his tutor that ‘Henceforth I will sign and sign, but not resign’.”

Our Faking News team along with experts have deciphered the step-by-step training given to Kejriwal in Jindal’s hospital here. Our sources affirm that Kejriwal will discuss with anyone who comes to meet him only using these signs:

First, nose is being fine tuned to catch any ‘sting’ probability. This medicine can help Kejriwal find out anyone with camera or recorder by its smell. If found, Kejriwal will show the door(refer the 6th pic)

After the smelling part, then the sign language will start. This sign is to denote the person that “Let the discussion flow, but I will not hear a single word of it”. This means he is not interested to hear him. Will be used for party dissenters.

This sign is to persuade the person to stretch the limits of the discussion & look beyond what is in hands, i.e., announce freebies and look at Modi’s hands for funds.

This sign will be used to denote the person that the discussion is more Left than Right. Now, the direction of discussion will turn from Left to somewhat Right.

This is to bring the topic back from Right to Left. See how the Left Knee is bent upwards to symbolize that Left. The usage of alternate hand-leg is to stress the alternate form of politics that he practices.

This is ‘showing the door’ to the person, if Kejriwal is not happy with the discussion. The person should immediately leave.","Kejriwal went to Bangalore to learn Sign Language, to escape future stings: Sources",2835,2.222222222
3622,0,"PM Narendra Modi, today, undertook an aerial survey of theaters across the country screening Dilwale, after receiving a string of news reports about victims traumatized by the Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol starrer.

The development was announced by Press Information Bureau through a tweet that attached a pic of the PM peeping through his carrier’s window and taking a look at the devastation caused by the Rohit Shetty movie. The PIB also followed the report up with a tweet declaring that the PM might soon announce a relief package for Dilwale victims.

While most victims who shelled out more than 300 Rupees to watch the movie have welcomed the PM’s actions, a few remain skeptical. “You never know. He does this now, but soon, he might have dinner with Rohit Shetty and the crew,” a disillusioned victim said.

Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi took the opportunity to lash out yet again at the PM. “India mein Swades kaun laaya? India mein Chak De India kaun laaya? [Who brought Swades in India? Who brought Chak de in India?] It was because of the Congress party that Shah Rukh Khan gave his most memorable movies in recent times. And after Modi became the PM, what have we seen? Happy New Year and Dilwale! I rest my case!” the National Herald case co-accused told The UnReal Times.

The Dilwale team, meanwhile, has cried vendetta and termed the move as a vindictive act against Shah Rukh Khan’s recent claim that there was intolerance in the country. Sources, however, added that King Khan is planning to reach out to Delhi’s top movie reviewer Arvind Kejriwal, who’s also Delhi’s Chief Minister, to review the movie, so that the film gets good collections at least in the National Capital Region. “Time to get back to where my life began. Dilli and Arvindji will save my life, inshallah! We need to maximize our collections in Delhi, before the odd-even rule begins next year,” Shah Rukh reportedly said.

The Delhi Chief Minister, however, lashed out at Red Chillies Entertainment and Rohit Shetty Productions. “If you can’t make good movies, then hand your production house to us.

Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan, medium pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, all-rounder Hardik Pandya returned to the India ODI squad for three-match series against South Africa starting from March 12. Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar and Pandya proved their fitness in the recently-concluded Dy Patil T20 Cup. Meanwhile, KL Rahul, who was excellent in the limited-overs series against New Zealand, but not included in the Test squad, has also been included in the squad.

Limited-overs vice captain Rohit Sharma was rested from the series. He had suffered a calf injury which had ruled him out of the New Zealand Test series. But with youngster Prithvi Shaw in the 15-man squad, it will once again be a three-way contest for the openers slot between Shaw, Dhawan and Rahul.

Though, India persisted with Rahul as the wicketkeeper in the New Zealand series, Rishabh Pant has been included in the squad. It remains to be seen if India go with Rahul or Pant in the playing XI in the series.

This is the first series in which all-rounder Pandya has been included in since his back surgery in October. Post his surgery, Pandya had initially hired the services of Delhi Capitals trainer Rajnikanth Sivagnanam to undergo rehab with Team India physio Yogesh Parmar keeping an eye on Pandya’s progress post his back surgery in October.

But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly made it clear that all players must report to the NCA to undergo rehab.

The Indian team management then convinced Pandya to head to the NCA when he trained with the players at the Wankhede Stadium before the ODI against Australia. Having completed the process, he returned to the field in the ongoing T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai and has already hit two hundreds.

Speaking on his fitness, Pandya said: “For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”

The first ODI will be played on March 12 in Dharamshala and the second on March 15 in Lucknow. The final match will be played in Kolkata on March 18.

NEW DELHI: A day after Parliament approved the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, two non-BJP states — Punjab and Kerala — on Thursday vowed not to implement the legislation. This came even as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee called a meeting of her MPs and MLAs on December 20 to draw up Trinamool Congress’s strategy on CAB.“Terming the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) as a direct assault on India’s secular character, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said his government would not allow the legislation to be implemented in his state,” the CM’s office said in a statement.Singh said his government “would not let the legislation rip apart the secular fabric of the country, whose strength lies in its diversity.”Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the bill would not be implemented in Kerala, as hundreds of students of a college in in Kozhikode took out a protest rally and burnt copies of the bill and an effigy of Union home minister Amit Shah The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) too protested against the CAB.While asking people to oppose the bill, Vijayan claimed the law is a rejection of secularism and BJP had made it clear that its main political plank is communalism. “The Act is unconstitutional..

3625,0,"Samajwadi Party Chief, Shri Mulayam Singh Yadav, got a taste of his own medicine with the CBI doing a U-turn and refusing to ‘go slow’ in investigating allegations of the Yadav chieftain possessing assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

The CBI’s U-turn comes despite the Center directing the premier investigation agency to suspend the case in the wake of the Samajwadi Party bailing out the Singh government during the vote in Parliament over allowing FDI in multi-brand retail. Justifying the move, CBI director, Shri Ranjit Sinha, said his boys are sick and tired of Mulayam’s erratic U-turns, which in turn induces the Center to make U-turns over investigating his shenanigans.

“And as a result, our work schedule is full of U turns which has thrown our work life balance completely out of gear. For instance, currently I have nothing to do. But just when I am about to plan a nice little vacation, I might get a call from by boss, Shinde sir, asking me to reopen the Mulayam case because he has done a volte-face on a pending bill and needs to be checked. Heck man, ever since Didi withdraw support and the UPA’s survival hinges on support from the SP, our life has become miserable. Now we have decided to complete the investigation come what may, Mulayan’s U turns be damned,” thundered the CBI Director.

CBI officers investigating the case have revealed more details of the fluctuating and highly uncertain nature of their work. “In the days leading up to the FDI vote, Shinde sir was driving us hard to crack the case against Mulayam ji. We were putting night outs to get results and then suddenly a few hours before the vote in the House, Shinde sir told us to drop the case and go back to the bench,” moaned Vineet K. Gupta. As a result of the highly variable and volatile nature of their work schedules, many of the CBI officers now suffer from insomnia and BP.

Mulayam, who was apparently driving from Delhi to Agra, made a U-turn after hearing about the CBI’s decision to rush back to the capital. However, the SP chief was in such a state of panic that he made a series of random semi-U turns during the route, and is now lost somewhere in the badlands of Bundelkhand. Frantic efforts are on to locate him.","CBI does U turn on Mulayam, refuses to close case against him despite Govt’s orders to the contrary",2239,2.099151407
3626,0,"The warring constituents of the Janata Parivar, JD(U) and RJD, have finally figured out a fair mechanism to decide the seat sharing formula for the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections. Candidates of the two parties will play a game of musical chairs to decide who gets to contest and who doesn’t.

The game will be moderated by the leader of another prominent Janata Parivar constituent, Mulayam Singh Yadav. Explaining the rules of the game, Mulayam said, “To begin with, we’ll arrange 485 chairs in a circle, and have every candidate for every seat from the two parties stand in a bigger circle around the circle of chairs. Then the usual musical chairs rules take over – every time the music starts, the candidates will start running, and when it stops, they’ll rush to take a seat. The candidate who’s left standing is out.”

“We’ll keep taking out one chair after every round until the last round when there’d be 243 chairs. Whoever manages to find himself or herself a chair, will be the final candidate!” said Mulayam with a triumphant smile.

According to sources, Patna’s Gandhi maidan has already been identified as the venue for the game, and is currently being swept by security personnel for bombs. A rule making committee comprising a section of top JD(U) and RJD leaders is framing rules for the game. “You cannot bring guns to the game. You cannot bribe the other candidate. You cannot physically kick someone off a chair. Regular stuff like that,” said a committee member.

The workers on the other hand, are identifying appropriate raunchy Bhojpuri numbers to be played during the game.

However, plans ran afoul when Nitish Kumar publicly suggested a new rule: Those who run around wearing a skull cap will be given an extra life. Every candidate from the two parties promptly agreed to this, resulting in complications in the rules of the game. Things got a lot messier when Nitish Kumar further demanded a few seats just for Mahadalits, prompting the other candidates to demand reservations for other castes in Bihar.

“We will now have several circles of musical chairs, their respective numbers decided based on the caste split up in the state. We are still working out how many such circles we’ll have, as we have to be careful not offend a particular sub-caste by not giving it its own musical chairs contest,” said a harried looking member of the rule-making committee. “And then there’s the extra-life rule for skull cap wearing participants… bhak budbak, I quit!” he exclaimed.

As things last stand, Janata Parivar leaders are now squabbling over the rules of the mechanism they framed to stop the squabbling over seat-sharing.

“What we see instead, is miscreants doing everything that GAU doesn’t stand for. With this acronym expansion, I hope those chaps will learn and conduct themselves in the true spirit of the gau mata‘s nature and what she embodies,” the angry PM told The UnReal Times.

He’s really a psychopath, yaar! In a good way, though,” the AAP chief chuckled.

Sources, however, added that the Sangh Parivaar top brass is upset with the PM for what they call “having taken it too far” this time. “We’re absolutely okay with the PM going all secular-liberal once in a while by lashing out at our own supporters. But acronyms are meant only for special things, like describing a great scheme or to demolish the opposition.

That’ll be quite a sight to watch,” a thrilled director exclaimed. Tiwari also said that he’s hopeful of Parrikar confirming his attendance soon, adding the defence minister would be relieved to know that there is no formal dress code. “He can come even in beach shirts and shorts, we don’t care!” the director said.

Pakistani team is finding short heightened batsmen in the country to quickly send them to Dubai to tackle Kedar’s bowling. Such is the impact that Kedar has made. Coaches around the world are asking for new bowling machines which can deliver balls from a very low trajectory to make their batsmen simulate the conditions of facing Kedar Jadhav in the matches. TV channels have started placing low trajectory cameras to capture the bowling of Kedar as the normal camera doesn’t show the ball reaching the batsmen as it is too low.

“I certainly haven’t been bowling it all along. But I like creativity so when I was bowling, I realized off-spinners are usual. Anyone who does not know to bowl will bowl off-spin. That’s when I tried a few new things like the sidearm ball and it worked. I tried it in the match and it got me wickets so stuck with it,” Kedar had told a few months back to a news source.","Media hails Taimur after India's win, says Kedar Jadhav's release point is equal to Taimur's height",1571,1.909611712

“We really appreciate the fact that journalists never blame Akhilesh Ji for any incident.

Former Supreme Court judge, justice (retired) Kurian Joseph, who was part of the unprecedented press conference last year by four senior-most judges against the functioning of the chief justice, said on Friday that he has no plan to dabble in politics.

Hailing from Kalady in Ernakulam district, he said both, the ruling Left Democratic Front and Congress-led United Democratic Front, have approached him but he told them he has no plan to throw his hat into the poll fray.

Known for his clean image and secular credentials, both the fronts were racing to pocket him, but he told them in clear terms he has no plan to take a plunge now and he will concentrate more on his home ground, legal affairs.

“Several people from both camps informally approached me. One of them even said I can chose from four seats. But I told them point blank that I am not interested,” he said in Delhi.

“Many offers came. But it is a question of my interest. As of now, it is a big no,” he said scoffing all rumours.

Post retirement last November, justice Joseph has settled in the national capital. Speculation was rife that he will join politics and contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

Last year in January, justice Joseph was among four judges who held an unprecedented press conference where they disagreed with then-CJI Dipak Misra’s style of functioning, saying he was assigning important cases to junior judges.

When the worst flood of the century hit Kerala in last August, justice Joseph was at the forefront in coordinating relief supply to the state and also sang “we shall overcome” at a fund-raising event in Delhi.

Starting his legal career in 1979, he held many positions and in 2000, he was appointed as a judge of the Kerala High Court. In 2010, he was elevated as the chief justice of Himachal Pradesh high court and in 2013, became a judge of the Supreme Court.","No plan to enter politics, says former Supreme Court judge Kurian Joseph",1912,2.30125523
3634,0,"Feeling chuffed and vindicated after the Supreme Court quashed a CBI probe against her in the 9 year long disproportionate assets case, BSP supreme and former UP chief minister Mayawati has decided to open a coaching center for politicians at her residence in Lucknow on how to be on the right side of the law and have the SC work for you while you work for the SCs.

A guest room in the palatial residence is already under renovation, to make way for the coaching classroom. The coaching center would officially be opened once a Golden statue of Behenji herself is erected at the entrance, said BSP officials. According to sources, the move has triggered several RTI applications seeking information on the costs involved and the sources of funds.

However, Mayawati is confident that these applications too, will be quashed. “Otherwise what is the point of my coaching center?” she asked.

It has been confirmed upcoming Andhra politician and CM aspirant Jagan Mohan Reddy and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa have already enrolled themselves. Jagan, who has signed up for the center’s distance learning program, thanks to his detention by the CBI and interrogation for various irregularities, said “Yentra idhi? Most universities have a price for the application form, but for this one, I had to compulsorily send my application form with 10 trucks full of LPG cylinders! I just hope it is worth it, at the end of it all.”

Jayalalithaa also is looking forward to the course. “Maya promised to teach me how to make my assets more proportionate to my figures so that my disproportionate asset case also gets quashed,” chimed Amma, flashing the V sign to reporters.

A BSP member, who is framing the coursework, revealed on conditions of anonymity, that the first chapter of the course is titled “Support Pranab Mukherjee for President.”

This news was disclosed to our correspondent by the manager of the newly formed Afghanistan women’s cricket team, Miss Gulfroz Gulbhuktyiar. Speaking to The Unreal Times, she said, “We wanted a coach who can build our team from a scratch, yaa. We know the exploits of your illustrious son, Harbhajan Singh, from the land of the five rivers.

We are starting a 15-day orientation camp at Kandahar followed by a one month training program in the Swat Valley. He has also assured that from next year, he will be available full-time as he is pretty sure he will not be playing in Ranji matches also. He is our man for the future.” Her compatriot and team vice-captain, Tehmina Afsandyar Khattak, sequaled in delight, “EEE!! Can’t wait to learn how to bowl the doosra!”

Bhajji authenticated the news, saying, “I will not be playing international cricket in the near future. My proposal for a cricket academy has also been turned down. I do not even have any reality show to shoot. So why not use my down-time to spread the game to those parts of the world that were fortunately not part of the British empire?”

Bhajji also pooh-poohed the threat perception from fundamentalists. “There is so much in common between the Sardar and the Pathan. You see, there are Sardar jokes and there are Pathan jokes too. We are both a jovial, feisty and debonair community. In fact, I got the inspiration to coach a women’s cricket team after watching Shah Rukh bhai coach the Indian eves in hockey,” revealed the off-spinner.

The Taliban have given their consent to Bhajji coaching their sisters. “We usually don’t countenance such abominable acts but are willing to make an exception for Bhajji coaching our sisters, provided they adhere to the dress code.

He recognized tennis player Roger Federer, who had appeared on a television show along with Pete Sampras to have discussion with the audience during his first visit to India.

“I know you Federer”

Immediately after Suhel identified Federer (by calling his name correctly), more than 50% of the audience fainted in the auditorium.

Organizers had a tough time for next 5 minutes, till the time people came back to their senses. Some people left the venue saying that this was too much of shock for them and they need to reconcile with this for at least a week before they could be back.

On being asked by the media after the show about his unprecedented performance, Suhel first accepted the goof-up that he caused during the literature event. He then shared his strategy that he formulated immediately after the event.

He stated that immediately after the event, he went to a book shop buy two books-1) General Knowledge Today and 2) Personalities in Pictures. He went on to add that initially he could only identify Rakhi Sawant and Bipasha Basu in pictures and was somehow able to identify Mahatma Gandhi after being given three clues.

He termed the person who had given him clues a “dolt”.

On being asked about Alia Bhat’s claim that her G.K. was better than Suhel Seth, he immediately conceded defeated but agreed that he will give her run for the money during next one year.

Rohit apparently gave Warner a piece of his mind in Hindi, inducing the Aussie opener to retort: ‘’Speak in English”.

“As soon as I heard about the incident,” recalled Rajnath, “I pinged Shri Shastri to tell me what happened. He kept saying Shri Rohit gave Shri Warner the full monty. Out of exasperation, I pinged Shri Rohit to send me the transcripts of his frank exchange of views and he promptly obliged. When I read it, I too couldn’t understand all of it. I think Shri Sharma was calling Shri Warner a Vada Paav or something like that but the important thing is there was no trace of that mleccha tongue, English. It was all colloquial Hindi laced with some Marathi. My chest swelled with pride after reading through it.”

Rajnath urged other cricketers to emulate Rohit and not hesitate to give back in their native tongues, whether it be Tamil or Hindi or even Bhojpuri. “Our boys try to sledge back with fake accents, using fancy words and fall short. This rubs off adversely on their performances with the bat and ball too. Doesn’t Hindi have a colorful vocabulary to borrow from? Why this mad dash to ape the Australians and their vulgar colloquialisms? If our boys take pride in their glorious indigenous traditions of sledging, believe me, the confidence and swagger will come back. Then there is no reason why we can’t bring the World Cup home,” Rajnath reasoned.

Acknowledging Rajnath’s praise, Rohit credited skipper Dhoni for instilling the right attitude in him. “Initially, I used to try and emulate Shastri bhai and Dravid bhai,” the Mumbaikar noted. “However, it took me at least 2 minutes to frame the response in English by which time I would be dismissed and to make matters worse, the Aussies would give me another colorful send off.

NASHIK: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""doob maro"" jibe directed at the opposition in connection with scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.Addressing a poll rally in Niphad here in north Maharashtra, Pawar asked Modi why was he daring the opposition leaders to bring back Article 370 of the Constitution after it was nullified by Parliament in August.Pawar also hit out at Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for saying that public sector banks had the ""worst phase"" under the combination of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan.The Maratha strongman was a senior member of the Manmohan Singh-led cabinet.Modi had on Wednesday slammed the opposition leaders, seeking a link between the scrapping of Article 370 and the Maharashtra assembly polls, and told them to ""go drown"" (doob maro) for criticising the nullification of the controversial provision that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.""How can they (Opposition) say that Jammu and Kashmir has nothing to do with Maharashtra? They should be ashamed of such thoughts. Don't they have any shame? Doob maro,"" the PM had said, using the two-word phrase in Hindi.Referring to the comment, Pawar said, ""Parliament abrogated Article 370. Modi sahib took the initiative. We do not oppose that. Some people kept forth their views on the issue, but they were labelled by some as anti-national. They become anti-nationals?""""The Prime Minister yesterday said doob maro. He dares us to bring Article 370 back. It was decided to scrap Article 370, Parliament scrapped it and now why are you now talking about bringing it back?"" he questioned.The former Union minister further said that there were several issues concerning the people, yet BJP leaders were consistently talking about defanging of Article 370.The only answer BJP leaders had for any of the people's issue was Article 370, Pawar quipped.On Sitharaman's remark, Pawar said, ""Are these people not aware of the tradition of this country? We never criticise the Prime Minister when abroad. They should also be mindful of this tradition.""Sitharaman had made the remarks while delivering a lecture at the Columbia University in the US.Pawar targeted the BJP-led government in Maharashtra over farmer suicides and job losses in the state, saying it did not pay attention towards these key issues.Maharashtra, which has a 288-member assembly, will vote on October 21 and results will be announced on October 24.",Sharad Pawar targets PM Modi over 'doob maro' jibe: Why talk now about bringing back Article 370?,2734,2.743233358

3641,0,"After a series of “Ghar Wapsi” campaigns in various parts of the country where people from other religions were “re-converted” to Hinduism, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to go international – the organization has now planned a Ghar Wapsi for West Indian cricketers of Indian origin, such as Ravi Rampaul, Sunil Narine etc, ahead of the BCCI’s squad selection for the upcoming 2015 World Cup. The Board Of Control for Cricket in India too, has given its nod to the VHPs plan.

“Look at the sheer amount of talent they’ve taken away from us – right from the Afridi-aged Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who will still be an asset in our Test squad now, especially down under, to the likes of Ravi Rampaul, Sunil Narine, Samuel Badree, Veerasammy Permaul, Denesh Ramdin, Narsingh Deonarine and so on. Who can forget Ramnaresh Sarwan, who has often been such an Andy Flower-like pain for the Indian team? Also, with Kohli preferring good sledgers, Sarwan, with his experience of taming McGrath, will be very useful. Why, again, have we outsourced all these talented players to the Caribbean? What are we gaining from it? Nothing! It’s about time we bring these guys back home to their Hindu heartland,” VHP chief Dr. Pravin Togadia told The UnReal Times‘ West Indian bureau chief, Narine Mannipaul.

“This is very easy-kill, as these players are already Hindus. All that’s required is de-anglicizing their names and making the Narines Narayans, Sarwans Saravanans, Sammys Swamys and so on. The BCCI has been very supportive of our proposal. Many of the board members are of the view that Narine will do a far better job of opening the bowling than Ishant Sharma. As it is, Narine already has huge fans in the team, Ravichandran Ashwin being the biggest one,” Togadia added.

Sources added that former BCCI president N Srinivasan too, has declared his support for the idea and has even promised free poonals and upanayanam ceremonies for the homecoming players. With Srini Mama’s backing, expectations are high that non-Indian origin West Indian players will return too. “Pravin thambi, Dwayne Bravo has anyway become adopted by Chennai, as has Gayle in Bengaluru. And Sammy became a Tam Brahm ever since The UnReal Times declared him one and more so, after Dr. Subramanian Swamy accepted him as his relative. So bring them also back, paa,” Srinivasan told the cancer surgeon.

3643,0,"Mumbai. The Association of Random White Women in Bollywood (ARWWB) has decided to go on strike to protest against alleged racial discrimination by the Indian filmmakers. The strike is being led by the Australian singer-actress Kylie Minogue, who has been allegedly accused by producers of Blue as being responsible for the movie’s lackluster performance on the box office. Kylie had made a special appearance in song titled Chiggy-Wiggy in the Blue movie.

Kylie and Akshay had danced together in the song Chiggy-Wiggy

“The producer was audacious enough to say I was not sexy enough in the song to attract Indian viewers. What the hell! I was doing just fine in the song when this guy called Akki jumped in and started all arbit dance steps. I tell you, a fat Aussie under the effect of beer can dance better. How do you expect me to look sexy in such situation?” Kylie wondered and alleged that she is being made a scapegoat for being white.

ARWWB members point out that while movie and television producers, and even the IPL managers, have profited by showing white women, now they are beginning to discriminate them to favor of Asians and women from other brown countries. They cited the examples of Lankan beauty Jacqueline Fernandes being cast in Bollywood movie Aladin while Brazilian model Giselle Monteiro getting a chance in Love Aaj Kal.

According to Cheryl Greene, the spokeswoman of the ARWWB, the trouble started last year itself when Yash Raj Films started the practice of reverse discrimination by hiring only black and brown women for its major song and dance sequences. ARWWB has even moved a petition in the High Court against the Yash Raj Films.

“This entire process started with the movie Tashan. Some of our members decided to not dance in the background of the song ‘white white face’ as they had apprehensions about the message it would send to lecherous Indians who had already made the life miserable for white faced cheerleaders during the IPL. Yash Raj then played the diversity card and started hiring black and other Indian women, who agreed to dance for much lesser prices.” Cheryl informed.

A copy of the lawsuit which we acquired through our sources in the High Court also revealed that the Association was against Yash Raj Films setting all their plots in the United States instead of India. Rhonda Williams a member of the Association, who had shown her cleavage in many Bollywood movies, said “How can Yash Raj Films be so insensitive? By not giving us work and shooting abroad, they are kicking us where it hurts the most – and that is our stomach.” Rhoda clarified.

A senior production assistant in Yash Raj Studio, speaking on the conditions of anonymity, rubbished the allegations. “True, we have had some movies shot in the USA, like New York, where we had to employ Indians, but only if you consider Katrina Kaif as an Indian. Furthermore, some movies like Dil Bole Hadippa had no scope for white women as they would have overshadowed Rani Mukherjee. But look at how much work we gave them in a single movie like Chak De India.”

But some feel that the white women need not worry. A camera assistant, who worked in the movie Tashan said, “There is nothing to worry about as far as these white women are concerned. Everyone knows Indians love white meat. Why do you think chicken or fish sells more than goat? And besides, it was us behind the camera who wanted black women in Tashan, so that Kareena’s so-called size zero figure could actually look like one when contrasted with the background.”

The first hearing in this case shall commence next week as the case would be overseen by a fast-track court given its national importance.","Kylie accused for failure of Blue, white women allege discrimination",3682,1.656708311
3644,0,"New Delhi. Taking the concept of “dreaming big” to a whole new level, Rahul Gandhi has decided to sleep daily inside Parliament, after he dreamt of Congress being in absolute majority during his yesterday’s sleeping session.

Sources tell Faking News that in his dream, Rahul Gandhi saw himself defeating Narendra Modi by over 10 lakh votes in a Lok Sabha elections. Initially he was shocked, but he convinced himself that it was not any “inception” by some BJP or RSS member.

Dream big.

“Rahul ji was in total command of his dreams,” Congress leader Rajiv Shukla informed, “We told him that the dream proved that he could do the unthinkable. It was then that Rahul ji realized that he was really capable of doing something great, and he has decided to sleep daily.”

Considering the count of Congress MPs inside Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi believes that his decision to sleep and dream daily in the Parliament will help the party and its morale.

“When the dream is sweeter than the reality, there is no point of living in reality,” explained Rahul, while recalling the Hollywood flick Inception. “All of us have both the options, but most of us chose to live with their pathetic life while ignoring the fact the their lives could be turned upside down if they accept their dreams as their new reality.”

On being asked that whether it was BJP’s stand of not giving the Leader of Opposition post to a Congress leader, which forced him to explore an alternative option, Rahul philosophically replied, “Necessity is the mother of invention.”

Excited by the newly found way to return to power, other Congress MPs and ex-MPs are very eager to learn this new trick from Rahul Gandhi. Reportedly, Rahul Gandhi is honing his dreaming skills and later he will train all the Congress MPs to dream together in a controlled way, like it happened in the movie Inception.

“Idea is to make other MPs capable of joining Rahul Gandhi in his dream,” revealed a Congress insider, “Then all MPs will jointly rule the Parliament using the concept of shared dreaming. As ex-MPs are not allowed inside Parliament, they will be sleeping from home.”

Meanwhile after coming to know about Congress’ grand plan of winning elections and forming a government in dreams, NDA has hired few lucid dreamers to train its own MPs.

“Our MPs will infiltrate into Rahul’s dream and will ask for a re-election,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh explained the counter strategy, “We have also requested the EC to train its officials and get ready for another election.”

Amidst all these, Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan has expressed her happiness over the idea of all MPs sleeping inside the Parliament.","While asleep in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi dreams of Congress being in majority, will sleep daily",2664,1.726726727

The star has high hopes from his upcoming flick “Race 3”, which is an imitation of his real-life incidents. To avoid controversies, the filmmakers have decided to include a disclaimer stating that the film is based on true events.

Part-time director and full-time reality show judge Remo D’souza is directing the film, parts of which are based on the real-life incidents of Salman’s life. Talking about the Race franchise, Remo said, “It’s an interesting script. Initially, we had named it ‘No One Killed Nurulah’, but after we realised that the makers of ‘No One Killed Jessica’ could pose us problems due to the similarity in titles, we named it ‘Race 3’.”

Remo also justified the title, given how the first two films of the franchise were full of mind-boggling twists. “Everyone expected justice but you all are shocked, aren’t you? That’s the kind of surprise we wish to recreate with Race 3,” he said.

Salman Khan, who is highly excited for the film, claimed that he started preparing for the role in 2002. “In Race 3, we have a chase sequence where I rash-drive an SUV in the streets and footpaths of Bandra, except there’s nobody chasing. So, why I drive on the footpath will remain a mystery, followed by mysterious deaths and acquittal. If this doesn’t resemble reality, what else will?” he said, explaining the need to include the disclaimer.

Video footage from the CCTV camera sheds valuable light on the disturbing incident: The PM is seen waiting for his car, motionless, with a flock of pigeons taking turns to perch on his body, some on his head, some on his shoulders. After 30 minutes, a group of attackers enter the frame and gingerly approach the PM. One of them is about to take out a hammer from his kit when his associate all of a sudden notices the PM’s eyes blink and yells, “Oye teri! Yeh to khud Pradhaan Mantri hain, unki moorti nahin! Chal bhaagte hain yahaan se,’’ before scampering away. A few minutes later, the PM’s car arrives and Dr. Singh nonchalantly gets in.

The attackers have since been nabbed by security agencies and severely reprimanded for their foolish act. However, they have been let off after the PM personally intervened and gave them a clean chit. “This is not the first time this has happened. Some time back, when I was in Madam Tussauds in London, a lot of people had similarly gathered around me, mistaking me for a wax figure. Perhaps in this instance, I should have waved my hand to let them know that I am not a statue. But I did not want to frighten the pigeons so I merely blinked my eyes instead,” recalled Dr. Singh.

Nevertheless, the Special Protection Group has beefed up the PM’s security to prevent a repeat of such incidents. “RAW has informed us that the PM, on account of his non-existent body language, faces heightened threat perceptions from more aggressive avian species like eagles and crows and has cautioned us to be on maximum alert,” revealed a SPG spokesperson.","Miscreants try to vandalize PM, mistaking him for a statue after spotting pigeon perched on his head",1843,2.278893109

The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection in the country.

The department topper, who spurned a $200,000 offer from Google to improve its search algorithms, will instead be working with the Indian cricket team to prepare the optimal pitch to ensure an Indian victory in under 4 days.

The move to hire an IIT whizkid comes in the wake of differences between Dhoni and curator for the Kolkata Test, Prabhir Mukherjee. Much to the chagrin of the Indian skipper, Mukherjee has signaled his intention to either prepare a batsman’s paradise with nothing for the bowlers or an out and out turner that could yet again consume the Indians.

“Indian curators are so dumb, yaar. They lack the nous, patriotism and skills to prepare pitches in the national interest. So I was elated when I got an email from Prashant saying he has ‘cracked’ the problem and can prepare a pitch that will ensure an Indian victory with 95% probability,” recalled Dhoni.

The Indian skipper immediately made a dash for the verdant campus of IIT-Bombay to make a PPO that Bansal couldn’t refuse. The JEE topper has already put 3 night-outs to master the intricacies of soil preparation, aerodynamics, the physics of the SG Test ball gripping and turning, and the bio-mechanics of the Indian bowlers in his quest to prepare ‘the perfect pitch’.

However, after deeper study the problem seems more daunting than it initially appeared. “There are so many constraints, man, that the solution might not all be that simple. For one, Dhoni’s adamant that the pitch should negate the fastish spin of Monty. When I suggested some grass to firm up the soil, he completely freaked out. At the same time, MS doesn’t want a featherbed either saying his bowlers need something to work with but not so much that the Indian batting comes under pressure. Anyway, I’’ll try my best,” said Bansal, who for the first time is being really tested by a tough engineering problem.",IIT whizkid hired by Dhoni to prepare optimal pitch for Eden Gardens Test,2041,2.008819206

Women in Indian politics face a double disadvantage. The first is the difficulty in getting a foot in through the door in a male-dominated arena. Women account for only 12.15% of the outgoing 16th Lok Sabha. The second is facing unacceptable sexist remarks from male colleagues. The latest to face this is Jaya Prada, formerly of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and now a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). SP leader Azam Khan, in an attempt to highlight her new affiliation, referred to her innerwear being khaki, the colour of the RSS uniform.

This is the kind of raw deal that women of calibre, regardless of their political affiliation, are offered in Indian politics. Smriti Irani, despite her achievements, has often been dismissed as a mere television actress. Sharad Yadav felt it was important to discuss former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s weight. Lalu Prasad spoke of how he would make Bihar’s roads as smooth as Hema Malini’s cheeks. From being described as akin to a sex worker to her gender being questioned, four-time Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mayawati, has been at the receiving end of a staggering amount of vitriol. Politics needs a quantum increase in women to be genuinely representative. But the viciousness faced by women, who have held their own in what is a highly competitive world, is bound to deter other women who might want to consider politics as a career.

Politics need not have so much to do with gender. A person’s ability to take up a relevant issue and being able to work for the well being of constituents should be the only criteria. After all, men are not judged on their looks or their weight. This lack of respect towards women demonstrates that many male politicians are simply unable to accept women as their equals. It is equally shameful that audiences lap up such insults to women politicians. Witness the laughter when BJP leader, Kailash Vijayvargiya, spoke of Priyanka Gandhi having a “chocolatey” face. When people speak of how India has a woman defence minister and foreign minister, they seem to forget that these women have got there through sheer merit and against all odds. As in certain other professions, that is what should count in politics. To demean women politicians on issues that are irrelevant to the political discourse is repugnant. It is as much an assault on women as it is on our politics.",Opinion | Demeaning women is an assault on our politics,2425,2.144329897

“Yes, it is one more feather in the growing cap for Amit Shah ji, but I am afraid it has come at a huge price”, said Kedar Sahani while talking to super excited Rajdeep Sardesai.

“Look at the cost of two bananas Rahul Bose shared at a five-star hotel he is staying. These rebels have stayed so many days in posh hotels of Mumbai without going outside to have one vada pav also”, he added.

However, BJP general secretary Vinay Pratap Rudy says these so-called political pundits have no knowledge. “We have so much money in one of the piggybanks in our central office, if we break that we can topple governments of Punjab and Chhattisgarh”

When a reporter asked, “How can you do that, in these two states Congress has 2/3rd majority?”. To which Mr. Rudy replied, “Arre baba, how much time it takes for a Congress MLA to resign or breakaway to form another party. In Chhattisgarh INC has 68 MLAs to ours 15.

“States like MP and Rajasthan, fruits are so ripe, even if we throw a stone, these two governments will break”, said another BJP leader.

However, Party has not liked Mr. Rudy’s comments on cash dealings for MLAs invoice settlement.

“It was told to everyone during our last Chintan Baithak, no more cash dealings. Even while dealing with horse trading we must do it in digital way.

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

3656,0,"A major scuffle broke out between the incarnation of Maharaja Jai Singh II, the original owner of Jantar Mantar and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday over the rights to use Jantar Mantar. However, the property dispute was later resolved when Mr. Kejriwal decided to leave the place and protest at Red Fort.

Maharaja Jai Singh II, who built Jantar Mantar in 1724, had reincarnated in 1967, and has been keeping an eye on his property for the past few decades from a tea stall across the road.

He was delighted to see tourists from all over the world coming in to admire the structure he constructed, and his self-esteem had hit an all time high when he learned from the tea stall owner that his Jantar Mantar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in India.

However, for the past few years, he started to become a bit wary of a muffler-clad gentleman sneaking into the premise on a regular basis with a group of people. Initially he gave him the benefit of the doubt assuming they were just a group of theater artists hired by the administrators to entertain the tourists, but soon he realized that the man was popping up almost every day.

“Damn, even I didn’t come here that often when I was the king,” grumbled Mr. Singh.

And on Saturday when Mr. Kejriwal sauntered to Jantar Mantar again after breakfast, he said, “Enough is enough,” and decided to confront him.

He patiently waited at the gate and when Mr. Kejriwal was leaving the ground after dharna, he stopped him and asked, “What are you doing here?”

Mr. Kejriwal was dumbfounded by the question. He was not expecting anyone to question his rights to enter the place he belongs to, and he mumbled,”Umm, protesting.”

“What?”

“We…ahem,” he cleared his throat and said, “We are protesting.”

“Fine, but why here?”

“This is the place where we come to when we have to protest. This is where magic happens.”

“Go and protest elsewhere.”

“Where else can we go?”

“Protest in your house, your office, or go to JNU, but stay away from my property.”

“Your property? Does this place have an owner?”

“Yes, I own this place.”

“Hello, this is our official protest venue and we will protest here.”

Mr. Singh lost his cool. He grabbed him by the collar and pushed him to the ground.

“Oh, I get it, a Modi agent!” said Kejriwal, a hint of rabid glee on his face. “Go and tell your boss that Kejriwal is not scared of anyone,” he hollered.

The news spread like wildfire and AAP supporters started tweeting about how Modi is not letting Kejriwal work. A few articles were hurriedly published about the emergency like situation created by Modi.

Meanwhile, a couple of policemen heard the commotion at the ground and rushed to the scene, screaming, “Ink attack, ink attack.”

“No, but it’s an attack on democracy. He is not letting me protest here,” Kejriwal pointed to Jai Singh.

“But why cannot he protest? He lives here,” one of the policemen asked Maharaja Jai Singh and then turned to Kejriwal and inquired, “You own this place, right?”

“Umm, no.”

“Then?”

“No, I mean, there are open spaces, ideal for protests and no one stops us so…”

“Then you cannot use this place,” asserted the police inspector.

“If Delhi police were under the control of AAP, I would’ve suspended you and this guy would’ve been behind the bars.”

“You mean he would’ve been giving company to your MLAs?” they giggled.

Kejriwal glared daggers at the policemen. “Fine, I am leaving. I will go to Red Fort.”

“Why do you need to protest at historical places?”

“Because I will create history!” he avowed and left for Red Fort.

Then he/she waits patiently, perhaps with a hint of anxiety, until the rescue team arrives and gets him/her out. Now how might our celebrities respond if they happen to get trapped in an elevator?

When Shivraj Singh Chouhan gets trapped an elevator:

A mild wave of anxiety sweeps through Madhya Pradesh and Twitter, even as Shivraj Singh Chouhan patiently waits in the elevator. A few minutes later, the rescue team arrives on the spot, gets the door open and rescues Shivraj.

“Are you ok, sir?” one of them asks, as the CM steps out.

In response, Shivraj grins, takes his smartphone out and tweets, “I congratulate the rescue team who saved me from the stuck elevator. Deeply thankful and indebted to them!”

When Azam Khan gets trapped in an elevator:

After trying in vain to get the elevator moving, Azam Khan calls up his secretary and says, “I’m stuck in an elevator. This is happening to me because I’m a Muslim!”

“Don’t worry, sir, I’ll call the UP state police to rescue you ASAP,” the secretary assures Azam.

“Abey idiot!” Azam yells. “Leave the UP police alone. They are only to guard my buffaloes. Send some electricians.”

A couple of hours later, the elevator doors are wedged open, and Azam walks out. Immediately, he signals his men to seal the elevator.

“This elevator trapped a Muslim for 2 hours. It is now the property of the Waqf board,” Azam declares.

When Rahul Gandhi gets trapped in an elevator:

Rahul Gandhi enters the elevator at the ground floor and looks at the list of numbers and the letters ‘G’ and ‘B’ with a perplexed expression.

After a few moments, he calls up Sonia Gandhi and asks her, “Mumma, what’s the elevator password?”

“What password?” Sonia asks, confused.

“I dunno. There are some buttons here. What should I type?”

Sonia immediately alerts Ahmed about Rahul’s situation. Ahmed takes out his cellphone and makes a couple of urgent phone calls.

“What did you do?” asks Sonia.

“Called up NDTV and The Hindu. Within 2 minutes, they will flash a headline about you being unhappy about Rahul baba’s situation,” Ahmed explains. “Khurshid will also add that there were tears in your eyes.”

Sonia slaps her forehead and glares at the grinning Ahmed. Then taking matters into her own hands, she calls up some Congress leaders and asks them to rush to the scene.

By the time Sanjay Jha, Randeep Surjewala, Shashi Tharoor and Rita Bahuguna Joshi rush to the scene, OB vans are already there. Rahul baba has been banging on the door for over an hour now.

Hundreds of Congress supporters gather with butterscotch cake and posters of Rahul Gandhi, all set to feed the posters the moment Rahul is rescued.

While Jha, Surjewala and Bahuguna wonder what to do, Tharoor suddenly realizes what might have happened. He flicks his hair, swaggers towards the elevator panel, and presses the button. The door opens, and Rahul baba rushes out to hug him.

Soon, the media begins to question whether Rahul was stuck at all in the first place, and whether Rahul knew how to operate an elevator. That’s when the spokespersons swing into action.

“Rahul baba cannot be blamed for this. We take collective responsibility for the fact that he was stuck in the elevator,” Surjewala says.

“Getting stuck in an elevator is a lot less dangerous than the ghastly riots of 2002, which Mr.Modi presided over,” fires Sanjay Jha.

“Surely, the elevator’s design must have been confusing or the opposition has deliberately messed up the interiors. How can Rahul baba be at fault for this?” screams Rita Bahuguna Joshi.

When Arvind Kejriwal gets trapped in an elevator:

The moment he realizes that the elevator is stuck, Arvind Kejriwal is convinced that it is the handiwork of BJP-Ambani-Adani goons. Within minutes, Twitter is abuzz with trends like #IstuckWithArvind, #BJPdirtytricks and #Emergency2014. AAP supporters get into the act with some witty tweets:

“So, LITERALLY, the BJP doesn’t want to see the elevation of Arvind, babye! ;)” tweets self-proclaimed AAPTard, Abhinandan Sekhri.

Not to take things lying down, the right-wing TIMES NOW hits back with the hashtag #AAPElevatorDrama.

Arvind takes to Twitter to express his angst. “I am fine..thank u all..v know who is behind this..it’s anyone’s guess..such things won’t stop me..I’m ready to even give my life!” he tweets, and then goes on to RT hundreds of tweets in support of him.

“Attack on Arvind elevater is an attack on democrazy by facists !!! Will the Modi answer !!!” tweets AAP’s Ashutosh.

Several journalists too, condemn the incident. “Shame on right wing goons! A new low in politics!” tweets Rana Ayyub.

“Seriously, is this what the BJP can come with up, in response to AAPs undeniable popularity? Shame! Disgusting!” tweets Nikhil Wagle.

“Sorry to hear about Kejriwal’s elevator ordeal. Time Modi shows grace, puts politics aside and rescues him,” tweets Rajdeep Sardesai, and follows it up with this tweet: “Why did Arvind get stuck in an elevator? Read my book!”

Meanwhile, AAP supporters gather outside the elevator in large numbers and begin to protest with banners. Some climb into the elevator shaft, on top of the elevator, in their bid to show solidarity with Arvind by getting stuck alongside him. Some others peacefully fling stones at the police force, and the policemen respond with water-cannons, tear gas shells and lathi charge. Section 144 is soon imposed in and around the building.

Soon enough, the rescue team arrives. A defiant Arvind, however, declares that he will not be rescued and will continue sitting in the elevator in protest against the BJPs activities. Thus begins another dharna, an elevator dharna, the first of its kind.

Refusing to take any food, Arvind spends the night in the elevator, with as many of his supporters as could fit in within the 8×6 space. AAP supporters on social media get all the more hyperactive. “One man is putting his life at risk, in a small elevator, not even eating food, for the sake of the nation & all people can do is mock him. Sigh!” says a tweet and posts a pic of an unshaven Arvind staring emptily into space, with the expression of a man who has been persecuted all his life.

Right-wingers hit back with pics of senior citizens being forced to take the stairs, because the elevator couldn’t be repaired.

The next day, the rescue team decides that enough is enough, and forcibly carries Kejriwal out of the elevator and drops him outside the building. Kejriwal stands there expectantly, scanning the faces in the crowd, when a gentleman comes forward, sprays ink on his face and lands a resounding slap on his cheek.

Kejriwal heads straight to Rajghat, sits down and utters a “prayer” for peace.

3660,0,"Inspired by Sachin’s comments during a recent interaction with the press, Dr. Manmohan Singh convened a rare meet with media personnel during which he announced that he alone would decide when he would retire.

“I feel that when I should retire is something that only I will decide. When I started was decided by Sonia ji, so how can someone else decide when I should retire? Those who are advising me to retire did not appoint me, Sonia madam did. I get my strength from Gandhi family and from my expertise in macro-economic policy. Just like Sachin has no intention of following in the foot-steps of Rahul Dravid, I too have no intention of making way for Rahul Gandhi, unless madam explicitly orders me to do so,” said Dr Singh, lashing out at detractors for hinting that he ought to make way for Rahul Gandhi or even Pranab da.

Dr. MMS also disagreed with sentiments that he should quit when he is at the peak of his powers. “Shri Tendulkar has hit the nail on the head. Thos who want me to retire are selfish because when you are at the top, you should continue to serve the country instead of retiring.”

Stating that he was ‘madly in love with policy making’, Dr Singh was non committal about his desire to serve the country beyond 2014. “When people asked me this question before the 2009 General Elections, it was tough for me to answer. It is the same situation today; I don’t know what to say about the post 2014 General Elections situation. I will just enjoy the game. Don’t want to set targets.”

On scam after scam coming to light under his watch, Dr Singh shrugged, “Sometimes bad things happen which one can’t explain. You look at solutions, and put question marks and ask why this is happening, but you just don’t find answers. Eventually, you look at scenarios where you have done nothing and still continue to be in power. What could be the reason? Luck!”

Dr Singh paid obeisance at the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib near Connaught Place a day after the portions of the CAG report detailing irregularities in allocation of coal blocks by the Ministry of Coal (which he heads) were leaked to the press. Was it to get peace of mind or was it to say sorry? “When the 2G scam surfaced, I asked God ‘it’s been a tough time for me. Why so many scams? Where did I lack committement in preventing them?’ But all scams pass. It’s important to stay focused on the job,” disclosed Dr Singh.

Dr Singh also said that he pays a deaf ear to people criticizing his leadership and all kinds of negativity.

Now widely regarded as an elder statesman, Dr Singh feels that the aggression shown by younger leaders in Parliament is not required. “I have not been much vocal, but the aggression need not always be vocal. It can come from within. If you look into the eyes of the Opposition, they will know whether you are aggressive enough or not. Sometimes, it can be in the body language, maybe in the way you avoid responding to a verbal attack from a member of the Opposition. And then the way you counter by making eye-to-eye contact without blinking and maintain a stony silence, that conveys a lot of things.”
