Updated: Mar 02, 2020 13:51 IST

The Shiv Sena on Monday attacked Maharashtra BJP unit president Chandrakant Patil over his demand that Aurangabad be renamed Sambhaji Nagar and criticised the party for not changing it when it was in power in the State.

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena mocked Patil and reminded him that Sena founder Bal Thackeray had publicly renamed Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar 25 years ago. The Sena accused the BJP of using issues of Veer Savarkar and the Maratha warrior king Shivaji merely for political gains.

The editorial said that Sena members are the descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji and Chhatrapati Sambhaji and asked the BJP its lineage. Attacking its former ally, the Sena that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath changed of Allahabad and Faizabad after coming to power but BJP could not rechristen Aurangabad despite being in power in Maharashtra and at the Centre.

“In Maharashtra, there is no meaning left in the behaviour and talk of BJP. Chandrakant Patil is also following the footsteps of Fadnavis in talking where it is not necessary. Now he has gone to Sambhaji Nagar and said: ‘We are the descendants of Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Maharaj and not Aurangzeb. Therefore, the name of Aurangabad must be changed’. In the last years, you had your government in Maharashtra as well as the Centre. Why could you not change the name of Aurangabad to ‘Sambhaji Nagar,” the editorial said.

Last week, Patil had asked the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to officially change the name of the city. Patil was speaking in Aurangabad where civil polls are due next month.

The Sena slammed the BJP saying it is using issues such as Savarkar and Shivaji for political gains.

“Whether it is Sambhaji Nagar or Savarkar, these issues have been embraced by BJP just for the sake of politics. It was neither able to place one brick for the huge statue of Shivaji Maharaj nor did it give Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar... Since when did Chandrakant Patil become a historian? If he is so interested in digging up history, then he will realise that Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray had already renamed Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar 25 years ago,” it said."

Hours after expressing satisfaction at easing of relation with the West Bengal government, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday said the politics of violence and murders must end in the state in view of the coming elections.

Dhankhar made the statement at Siliguri in north Bengal where he went for a day to attend a few programmes. Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with the Trinamool Congress government on multiple occasions, said at a media conference that the state’s name was associated with violence and murders associated with politics and elections.

Earlier in the day at Jalpaiguri, he said, “In the past 15-20 days, my rapport with the state government has picked up. I think, now, we are in the proper take-off stage.”

Later, he took a jibe at state politics, saying: “In last many years, West Bengal’s name has been associated with political and election violence and political murders. These things should come to an end. I believe all are trying to bring this to an end.” He said bureaucrats and policemen should act neutrally.

“It is a constructive suggestion. Our image in the entire country should be of the nature that we will have the most peaceful elections,” he told reporters in Siliguri. Dhankhar’s statement comes at a time when preparations are being made for the civic polls. The assembly polls will be held in 2021.

Education minister Partha Chatterjee, who held a meeting with Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan on Thursday, said: “He said what he wanted to. We don’t want to react on his statements every day.”"

Dhankhar’s statement comes at a time when preparations are being made for the civic polls. The assembly polls will be held in 2021.

HT contacted senior Trinamool Congress ministers but nobody commented on Dhankhar’s statements till 7 pm.

“For violence to end, it is necessary that one should find out the root cause of violence,” said Dhankhar. He said efforts should be made to seize illegal explosives and bomb-making factories. “There should be a curb on this through a mission so that they can’t disturb the peace in the state,” he added.

Stressing on the need to have better relations between the governor and the state government, Dhankhar said, “We need dialogue and deliberation, we need to engage, we can’t be adversaries, we can’t be fighting with each other.”"

Expressing concern over the growing intersection of crime and politics, the Supreme Court (SC) has ordered political parties to publish the details of their candidates, with criminal charges, on their websites and social media platforms, and in newspapers. The parties must also clearly outline the nature of the charges, and explain why these candidates have been given tickets. This information must be made public, and a compliance report sent to the Election Commission (EC), within a specified period of time — and the failure to do so could be read as contempt. The order comes in the wake of the failure to effectively implement a 2018 court order which laid down similar, though somewhat more limited, guidelines.

The presence of politicians with criminal antecedents distorts democracy. A weak criminal justice system means that those accused of crimes — including heinous ones, such as murder and rape — are able to find ways to prevent a final judgment for years. They emerge as locally influential figures, who have illegally garnered resources. They develop a nexus with existing political leaders, the police machinery, and then branch off into newer kinds of business activities, which depend on State patronage. They, then, enter politics. Many win. For these legislators, public interest is not a priority.

The SC order is well-intentioned. It will force political parties to be more transparent. The compliance requirement is particularly significant, because it imposes tangible costs on parties if they fail to provide the requisite information and gives additional power to the EC. But it is also important to underline the limits of the order and the scope of misuse. Incumbent governments have shown a tendency to target political rivals, misusing law enforcement agencies. It is important that the SC order does not reinforce this trend. Till candidates are convicted, they must be treated as innocent. The criminalisation of politics also has deep roots. As political scientist Milan Vaishnav has explained, there is a supply side issue, where such individuals seek to enter politics for preservation and expanding wealth, and a demand side issue, where the dependence of parties on illegal finance is high, and where voters see many such individuals as capable of “getting work done”. Therefore, unless there are reforms in the criminal justice system which lead to quick judicial decisions, there is reform of the political finance regime and the dependence on wealth to win polls shrinks, and unless there is an overall reform in governance so that citizens are no longer dependent on locally influential representatives for work, politics and crime will remain enmeshed."

The 92nd edition of Academy Awards bestowed some of the most outstanding icons of the industry on Sunday and also gave the fashion police some serious business.

Besides fashion and glamour, Oscar’s haute couture also reflected politics with celebrities repurposing their red carpet looks with topics like sustainability and equality.

The Best Male Actor of the evening, Joaquin Phoenix used the opportunity of his acceptance speech to promote the idea of animal rights wearing the Stella McCartney tuxedo that he had planned to wear for the entire award season of 2020, reported The Hill.

According to The Hill, the Oscar presenter Jane Fonda announced on her first Fire Drill that the red coat she was wearing shall be the last outfit that she would ever buy and she proved it by donning the same dress that she wore at the Cannes Film Festival 2014.

According to a report in E!News, Kaitlyn Dever said that her Louis Vuitton dress was made of an eco-friendly fiber - Tencel.

The estimate of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests that more than 11 million tons of textiles were put to landfills in the year 2017 which further contributed to water pollution and carbon emissions. Despite the same, many celebrities changed into a second outfit for the after-parties.

Natalie Portman made a real fashion statement at the 92nd Oscars’ red carpet as she chose to wear a cape embroidered with the names of women who directed movies last year, and were snubbed for this year’s ceremony.

Updated: Feb 09, 2020 06:51 IST

After a high-decibel and bitter poll campaign, 61.7% of Delhi’s electors turned out to vote by 9 pm on Saturday in the assembly elections that will decide who will govern the city-state for the next five years. The polling percentage was 5.42 percentage points lower than in the 2015 assembly polls, when 67.12% of voters trooped out to vote.

Three Muslim-dominated seats -- Seelampur, Mustafabad and Matia Mahal -- recorded the highest voter turnout in the elections in which the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is seeking to retain power in what is seen as a bipolar contest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The highest turnout, until 9 pm, was recorded in Seelampur at 71.4% followed by Mustafabad at 70.56%; both seats are in northeast Delhi. Matia Mahal in old Delhi recorded a turnout of 70.33%.

All three constituencies have lately witnessed protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, which proposes to fast-track the grant of Indian citizenship to so-called persecuted minorities from the Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan such as Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis.

According to officials, the turnout in the first hour of polling was just 4.33%, which grew to 16.36% at 11 am, 26.36% at 1 pm, 45.54% at 3 pm and 57.87% at 5 pm. Till 5 pm, the Northeast district had recorded he highest voter turnout at 63.4% while New Delhi district was the lowest at 44.29%.

Poll officials said that the tentative lowest turnout till 9 pm was recorded at Delhi Cantonment, at 45.28%, followed by Chhatarpur at 46.51% and Ballimaran at 49.39%. Okhla witnessed a 58.83% voter turnout, which is lower than the 60.73% in the 2015 polls.

On constituencies recording top turnout and one of the lowest -- Ballimaran -- being Muslim-dominated constituencies, Praveen Rai, political analyst with the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, said: “Ballimaran and Okhla are constituencies in which the anti-CAA protests in Jama Masjid and Shaheen Bagh fall under. It is likely that many voters have boycotted the polls. In other Muslim constituencies, people voted in large numbers for betterment in civic conditions as well as in reaction to their anxieties concerning the citizenship law.”

In the 2015 assembly election, Gokalpur in northeast Delhi had recorded the highest turnout of 73.46% while Delhi Cantonment had polled the lowest votes at 58.49%. All assembly constituencies except Delhi Cantonment had polled above 60% votes in 2015 assembly elections.

In 2015, the ruling AAP received a landslide verdict, winning 67 out of the 70 seats. The BJP won the remaining three and the Congress ended up with none.

The AAP won 54% of the vote share in the polls which decreased in the civic body polls of 2017 and the Lok Sabha elections of 2019. The BJP polled 32% votes in the 2015 assembly polls which increased to 36% in the 2017 civic body elections. The saffron party won 56% votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In 2019, it had a lead in 65 of the 70 assembly constituencies. The Congress got just 10% of votes in 2015, 21% in 2017 and 23% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Delhi’s chief electoral officer (CEO) Ranbir Singh said that Saturday’s polling was smooth and peaceful, as the enforcement was better compared to the 2015 assembly polls. He said that there were nearly 14.79 million registered voters in Delhi across 70 assembly segments. Out of the total number of eligible voters, there were 8.1 million male voters and 6.6 million female voters. Besides this, there are 869 third-gender voters.

Singh said that the number of electronic voting machines (EVMs) malfunctioning this time was just 0.29% as compared to 0.31% in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Voting began at 8 am in the city amid tight security on Saturday and continued past the scheduled close of 6 pm in some booths to accommodate voters who were still waiting in queues.

“Till 9 pm, polling was still on at least 146 booths. There were long queues till late evening; the overall turnout could be updated only once the voting concludes. All those who had entered the polling stations by 6 pm were allowed to cast their vote,” said Singh.

Election officials said that there were as many as 13,571 polling stations at 2,688 locations. Out of these, 3,141 were designated critical polling stations and 144 vulnerable polling stations. The highest number of voters was in the Matiala constituency with around 400,000 voters. Chandni Chowk is the constituency with the lowest number of voters at 100,000.

There were around 200,000 voters above the age of 80, while 137 registered voters were above the age of 100, of whom 60 turned up to vote.

Of the 2,429 people above the age of 80 years, who opted for postal ballots, 2,257 cast their votes. Besides, of the 488 persons with disabilities who opted for the facility, 429 exercised their franchise.

The postal ballot, a facility hitherto restricted to the armed forces, was extended for the first time in Delhi elections to those above 80 years of age and the specially abled.

Also, in the 11 constituencies with a total electorate of 1.8 million where QR code-enabled voter slips were issued for the first time in Delhi, more than 1.1 million exercised their franchise.

“The voter slips are scanned by mobile phones. This is the first time that a booth app was used by the polling parties in these constituencies. It helps in faster scanning of names in the voter list and hence expedites the voting process,” said Kushal Pathak, director of information, Election Commission of India.

To ensure peaceful and fair polling in all 70 constituencies, as many as 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) were deployed. Besides, 19,000 Home Guards and 42,000 Delhi Police personnel were also on duty."

A day before Delhi Assembly elections, the Shiv Sena has praised Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the work done by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party for what it described as “communal polarisation” to garner votes and come to power in Delhi.

“Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have put their lives at stake on Delhi [polls] after they lost Maharashtra and after a crushing defeat in Jharkhand. Nothing wrong if they want to win Delhi, but despite an army of 200 MPs, BJP CMs and the entire Modi cabinet, it seems that Kejriwal is weighing heavy on all others,” an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said on Friday.

Delhi will vote on February 8 and the results will be declared on February 11.

In the previous election, AAP had won a resounding majority bagging 67 out of 70 seats. In contrast, the BJP, which was targeting a two-third majority, won just three seats.

The editorial lauded the Kejriwal government’s work in the last five years. It added that while Kejriwal is seeking votes on work done in public health, school education, etc, the “top leaders of BJP and its minister are engaged in political mudslinging of Hindu versus Muslim.”

“Kejriwal is seeking votes on the basis of work done in five years. This is a new experiment in the country’s politics. This should be welcomed beyond party lines. Voters of Delhi are intelligent,” said the editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana.

The former ally of the BJP acknowledged Kejriwal’s efforts in Delhi and hit out at the Centre for “creating obstacles” for the AAP government.

“Even after having limited power and despite regular obstacles created by the Centre, his [Kejriwal] work in the field of education, health and public facilities is ideal,” the Sena said.

The Sena slammed the BJP for calling the AAP Convenor a “terrorist” and for expressing “dislike” after he recited Hanuman Chalisa at an event in New Delhi.

“The BJP’s hate for Kejriwal is so extreme that they don’t even like him going to a Hanuman temple and reciting Hanuman Chalisa,” the Sena said, taking a dig at the BJP in Saamana.

It added, “If he is [a terrorist], then what is the Centre waiting for? They should act. Does the BJP want to suggest that 70% of Delhi voters voted for a terrorist in 2014?”"

Indian politics is dominated by regional satraps. They run one-person parties in which the entire structure is dependent on the leader. The space for intra-party dissent is limited or non-existent. They have a loyal social base, primarily, at least in North India, derived from their own caste identities.

In this matrix fits Nitish Kumar. The Janata Dal (United) is his party. His decisions — be it to leave the National Democratic Alliance (2013), ally with Lalu Prasad (2014) or return to the NDA (2018) — reign supreme. But where Kumar is different is that his own social base is extremely limited in the caste-ridden politics of Bihar. The JD(U) has not won a single election on its own, and has always depended on allies, be it the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). It is this political vulnerability that explains his decisions. Mr Kumar was not sure whether the BJP would back him as the chief ministerial candidate for assembly polls at the end of 2020, and engaged with both the RJD and the Congress to explore alternatives. But with Amit Shah declaring that Mr Kumar would indeed be the CM face, he has decided to firmly remain within the NDA fold. His decision to expel Pavan Varma and Prashant Kishor — who had both adopted a critical stance against the BJP — was a message that the NDA would stand united. This also means that Mr Kumar, despite indifferent governance in his third term, starts out as the favourite for the Bihar polls in 2020."

Updated: Jan 29, 2020 21:03 IST

It’ll be summer soon, and that means it’s time to start exploring fellowships, volunteer programmes, internships, maybe even start-ups. Added to the long list of options, as students try to expand their horizons and make their CVs more impressive, are the spaces of culture, heritage and urban studies.

Organisations operating in these spaces are responding with programmes for undergraduate and postgraduate students, and they say applications have already started coming in.

The work typically involves conducting surveys and research for white papers, assisting in urban planning projects, organising events and even engaging with the public at events, walks and trails.

Organisations in Mumbai to aim for include the Godrej India Culture Lab, Khaki Heritage Foundation, and the globally run Young Leaders for Active Citizenship (YLAC).

Exchange of ideas

The Culture Lab in Mumbai has a national fellowship programme and invites undergraduates, postgraduates and PhD students to apply for its two-month, full-time opportunity. Since the Lab’s focus is on urban-rural narratives, digital India, educational alternatives, dissent frameworks, environmental policies, and identity politics, students from any discipline who are working in or at the intersection of such themes are welcome to apply.

Selected fellows will assist in organising events, conducting research and producing white papers. The programmes are held in June-July or July-August, depending on the candidate’s academic schedule, and students are required to work 40 hours a week.

“The fellowship will take students beyond academics and push them to think in ways that come from a multidisciplinary approach,” says Koninika Roy, catalyst at India Culture Lab. “Since the India Culture Lab is all about a cross-pollination of ideas, students will get to learn a great deal by interacting with experts, working on the thesis for their own college projects (if any) and showcasing their work to a wider audience.” All fellows are paid a stipend.

Policy-making

For students in Classes 11 and 12, set to begin senior college, YLAC, which focuses on transforming learning systems and preparing younger generations to lead change, conducts a High School Achievers’ Programme every summer. Two modules are available — one with a focus on developing critical thinking through debates in political science, sociological concepts, philosophy and economics; the other with a focus on collaborating with NGOs, going on field visits, engaging with local communities and using academic skills to document and address social issues. The three-week programme is held in May in Bengaluru and in June in Mumbai and Delhi.

For college students interested in policymaking and politics, there is a month-long programme called Policy in Action, held across Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi and focused on developing core skills of advocacy and policy analysis. Students work closely on live projects with Members of the Parliament (MPs), who are invited as guest faculty. The sessions are conducted over the weekends and students work on projects remotely.

All fellowships require students to pay, but scholarships are available.

Siddhaarth Sudhakarna, 25, a senior product analyst, had enrolled in the Policy in Action fellowship last year. “I wanted to learn from the people actually working on national policies. We were all assigned to an MP or a planning agency to work on a topic. I was given a policy brief on judicial reform and how the system can be made more effective,” he says. As a software engineer he had no clue how to proceed. “But we had a team member who was a lawyer and guided us with questions and how to formulate them. The YLAC team also helped a lot, offering domain expertise. There’s so much about the Indian system that we should know as citizens, but we don’t,” Sudhakarna adds.

Know your city

For those interested in culture, heritage and culinary history, Khaki Lab by the Khaki Heritage Foundation has opportunities this summer for college students. “We have film screenings, food trails and panel discussions coming up and we would like college students to collaborate with us to organise these events and in the process, learn about the city’s forgotten history,” says founder Bharat Gothoskar.

Alisha Sadikot, a city historian and founder of the Inheritage Project, has two final year tourism students from Ruia college interning with her for the coming four months. “I have worked with their class before to do workshops and walking tours and that led to this internship opportunity. They had to intern, as part of their degree programme, with an agency in their field. The students will work with me and assist in my programmes and also develop one individual project idea of their own,” Sadikot says. “They will explore the wider fields of public history, urban heritage and engagement as part of their degree in travel and tourism, with a view to also exploring evolving employment opportunities in the field."

Updated: Jan 09, 2020 20:11 IST

Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu wants a law to check “reckless and unsustainable populist” promises of political parties. In a speech in Hyderabad on Thursday, he also pitched for simultaneous elections to curb money power in politics.

Speaking at an event organised by Foundation for Democratic Reforms, Bharat Institute of Public Policy and the Hyderabad University, Naidu said that the use of money in politics have raised concerns that “you have better chances of becoming an MP or an MLA at the cost of a more qualified candidate who is poor”.

Naidu slammed “unsustainable” populist promises and argued that a law like Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) is now required to check such measures as it harms the poor and the middle class.

The FRBM act was passed in 2003 by Indian Parliament for institutionalising financial discipline and reducing the fiscal deficit to a manageable limit to improve the overall financial health. It aimed for better use of public funds.

“Perhaps a time has come to consider a suitable legislation on the lines of FRBM Act,” Naidu said adding, “If a cap is introduced on the proportion of budgetary resources that can be deployed for short term benefits by law, then perhaps all parties will have a level playing field, and reckless and unsustainable populist promises can be kept under check.”

The Vice President underlined that a transparent budget helps to translate tax money into tangible services which are critical to help citizens make informed political choices.

Naidu also suggested that Parliament should think of making a law for ensuring transparency in the polity and to make accounts of political parties public.

A candid Naidu maintained that political parties need money to run their offices elections cost money for the parties and candidates.

But raising serious concerns over use of money in politics he said, “The money power is placing entry barriers to the more deserving but who are less endowed in terms of resources.”

Pointing out that 88 per cent of Lok Sabha MPs are ‘crorepatis’, he quipped, “This paradox of poor India with rich parliamentarians is raising concerns about growing role of money power in politics.”

“It has been reported that money power influences election processes in 40 wide ranging ways. These include selecting a candidate, setting up dummy candidates, financing weaker candidates of other parties, hiring vehicles, buying space in media, bribing voters through money, biryani, alcohol and consumer goods etc,” he said.

According to Naidu, mere expenditure ceilings and exhortations are not enough.

Naidu also supported simultaneous elections saying, “Simultaneous polls could also significantly bring down the cost of holding elections by the Election Commission of India and also the expenditure by the political parties besides other advantages. Hence, I urge upon the political parties to seriously consider the option of simultaneous polls and evolve a consensus.”"

Attacking the BJP for trying to stop the mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) in Delhi government schools, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that education should be a part of politics, but one shouldn’t politicise the education system.

Speaking to the media after visiting a school in Rouse Avenue, Kejriwal said that vote should be given to those who provide good education, and not to those who try to create divisions among the people on the basis of religion.

On being told the BJP is criticising the mega PTM and its timing, as Delhi will go to the polls in a few weeks time, the Chief Minister said that this was not the first such meeting.

“If they (the opposition) feel it is a poll gimmick, what can I say. They also tried to stop it. But it is wrong. There should be no politics with education and schooling. However, education should be a part of politics. I don’t understand why they want to stop this,” he told the media.

Delhi government on Saturday organised the mega PTM across all its schools.

Mega PTM in Delhi government schools was launched in July 2016 after the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi a year before. The AAP government claims that it has significantly enhanced parent-teacher interaction and partnership in children’s education.

Kejriwal said the PTM was only a concept in private schools earlier.

“In government schools, this used to happen only on paper. PTM is crucial for students’ growth,” he said.

Apart from Kejriwal, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia also visited schools in the city on Saturday.

“Had a lovely interaction with the parents on the unbelievable heights our children can reach, only if we put unflinching support behind them, irrespective of our own backgrounds,” Sisodia tweeted after the visit.

He said he felt good to see parents being welcomed warmly by the schools and having meaningful conversations with the teachers about education and their children."

Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan has rarely voiced his opinions about current affairs and he has now said that he avoids speaking about such issues as he understands that his desires are perhaps irrelevant to people. He added that he is privileged and does not feel “disenfranchised with that”.

Speaking with The Times Of India in an interview, Saif said, “Which is why (the privileges that he enjoys) I tend to keep quiet. Because I understand, that I am not only privileged, but my wants and desires are probably irrelevant to people with burning issues in a literally burning environment. So I get that, and I am quite happy with that. And I don’t feel disenfranchised with that. I do feel that I am absolutely way too privileged to really enter into that conversation with any relevant point of view.

He further told the daily, “I think, in a country like ours, taking either stand sometimes can have different results than what happens normally in an environment where people can voice views and discuss stuff and life goes on. It is a slightly more volatile environment, where the impact of what you say is louder, and some people enjoy that impact, I guess. I am not sure that I do, so I am still trying to form my opinion. It is a very interesting time and a disturbing time and you hear a lot of things, on one hand. And you are wondering how the country is going to define itself. That’s on one hand. And honestly, on the other hand, and I don’t mean to offend anyone when I say this, I have never been happier living in my country. The kind of medical treatment that is available to me and my family, the education for my kids, the professional employment and the work I am getting, everything about my life in India is better than it has ever been. So, I am hopeful.”

Saif is currently awaiting the release of period drama, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior where he reunites with Omkara co-star Ajay Devgn. The film also stars Kajol and hits theatres on January 10. Later this month, he also has Jawaani Jaaneman lined up for release.

Updated: Jan 01, 2020 14:20 IST

General Bipin Rawat, who took charge as the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) on Wednesday, said the job of the forces is to keep away from politics.

“We keep ourselves away from politics. We work as per directives of government in power,” General Rawat said when asked about reports that the armed forces are being politicised.

“The Chief of Defence Staff will remain neutral. He will be neutral to all the three services, within his own service,” General Rawat further said.

General Rawat’s remarks come days after he publicly condemned those leading violent protests, asserting that leadership wasn’t about guiding people to carry out arson and violence, comments that were widely seen as being aimed at the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests across India.

“Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate direction. We are witnessing in large number of universities and colleges that students are leading masses and crowds to carry out arson and violence in cities and towns. This is not leadership,” General Rawat said at an event in Delhi on December 26 as Army chief. He demitted the office on December 31 after serving as Army chief for three years.

The comments by the General drew sharp criticism from Opposition leaders and also senior retired officers. They were seen as being of a political nature.

“Since when have Army Chiefs started commenting about internal affairs. It undermines Civil-Military Relations whose cornerstone is that Armed Forces neither comment or interfere in domestic politics. This has been our singular success going back to 1947,” Congress leader Manish Tewari said on Twitter.

“Leadership is knowing the limits of one’s office. It is about understanding the idea of civilian supremacy and preserving the integrity of the institution that you head,” All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted.

In a statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also “unequivocally condemned” Rawat’s remarks.

A top retired officer said such comments were avoidable as it projected the military as partisan, especially at a time when strong political positions have been taken on the controversial issue.

The army establishment was quick to clarify that General Rawat had neither referred to CAA nor any political event or personality. It added Rawat was addressing the future citizens of India who are students.

After Parliament approved amendments to the citizenship law earlier this month, violent protests have taken place across the country. Multiple protesters have been killed and injured in these protests, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka."

Noted nuclear scientist and former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Dr Anil Kakodkar on Saturday asked students to stay away from politics, though he added that issues vexing them will give rise to agitations.

He was speaking at a function in Thane in Maharashtra on the occasion of the release of a book on his life.

He was answering a query from the media on the CAA and NRC protests.

Over the past few days, several campuses across the country have seen strong students’ protests over Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens exercise.

“I feel students should not get into politics.

However, if something is agitating them, then it is not that one has to keep quiet. All agitations are started by students and there is nothing unexpected about it,” Dr Kakodkar said.

He advised students to prepare themselves for the competition they would face in the corporate world, adding that failure to do so would be akin to the defeat princely states endured in the 19th century when the East India Company began expanding its footprint in the sub-continent.

He said the education system in the country has to gear up to ensure students got the knowledge required to solve the problems facing the country, and emphasis must be on those coming from rural areas so that they can compete with their city counterparts.

“There are plenty of opportunities in the form of skilling and training, and if this is done, then sky is the limit. The education system must provide students a good atmosphere as their progress is based on it,” he told the gathering.

He also paid tribute to Homi Bhabha, widely acclaimed as the principal architect of India’s nuclear energy programme.

Kakodkar said Dr Bhabha thought up the ‘three stage nuclear power programme’, which sought the use of uranium and thorium reserves found in monazite sands of coastal regions of South India, when even five per cent of that technology had not been firmed up."

Updated: Dec 19, 2019 20:08 IST

Union home minister Amit Shah has always worn his majoritarian outlook as a badge of pride. As a Gujarat MLA from Sarkhej — an Ahmedabad constituency with a large Hindu and Muslim population divided by an unofficial “border” — Shah never baulked at being seen as primarily representing the Gujarati Hindu voter in the locality.

While researching for my book 2019: How Modi won India, I came across an article by a senior Gandhinagar-based journalist Rajiv Shah. The journalist claims that a few weeks after the 2002 riots, when he reminded Shah of tension in the Sarkhej area, the pugnacious politician shot back: “Why are you so worried, nothing will happen where you live, whatever violence that takes place will occur only in the ‘other side’ of the ‘border’!” Shah’s seeming political incorrectness was rewarded by the voter. He has never lost an election from his bastion.

Seventeen years later, Shah’s political graph has risen dramatically upwards, but he remains unswerving in his commitment to his core beliefs. During the debate in Parliament on the Citizen Amendment Bill, Shah was unbending when questioned about the inherently discriminatory nature of the proposed law. While making it clear that Indian Muslims had nothing to be afraid of, he repeatedly emphasised that there is a basic difference between a Muslim immigrant (ghuspaithiya) and a Hindu refugee (sharnarthi). This is part of a Hindutva-inspired Savarkarite worldview, which in cultural and civilisational terms sees India or Bharat as principally the homeland of the Hindus. Align the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) to an all-India National Register for Citizens (NRC) (a combo package, as Bharatiya Janata Party’s Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma calls it), and the link between citizenship and identity politics becomes even clearer.

This might also explain the fear in the average Muslim mind that the new law will potentially disenfranchise them. Few of the protestors have read the fine print in the CAA, and an all-India NRC is still only in conceptual stage, but the political messaging has meant a creeping polarisation on the ground is inevitable. The CAA-NRC initiative, after all, comes on the back of the break-up of the country’s only Muslim-dominated state into two Union territories, a Supreme Court order granting the title of the disputed land in Ayodhya to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, and a law that criminalises triple talaq.

The sense of fear among ordinary Muslims is matched by a growing anger and hostility towards a seemingly partisan State apparatus, a pent-up fury that can be easily pushed over the edge. Then be it Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) or Aligarh Muslim University, Seelampur or Howrah, the protests in several minority-dominated areas have only fed into a political propaganda machine that thrives on stoking the Hindu-Muslim divide for electoral gains. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have been conspicuous by his absence during the Parliament debate on the CAA, but on the campaign trail in Jharkhand, he seems to be far more vocal. Take, for example, Modi’s controversial remarks during an election rally in Dumka: “People who are setting fire to property can be seen on TV. They can be identified by the clothes they are wearing.” Can there be a more glaring instance of dog-whistle politics at election time?

Two narratives, then, are running concurrently. The first views the Muslim as victim of a divisive political agenda where State power is being used to relentlessly single out a community. The brutal police attack inside the JMI campus in Delhi is another reminder of how the men in khaki can run amok in a tense Muslim-dominated neighbourhood. The second is to see the Muslim as a lumpen radical Islamist who is a law and order threat. Images of burning buses and damaged railway tracks are replayed to stereotype a community as a security risk. Both narratives ensure that the communal pot is kept boiling.

Lost in the vicious and polarised debate is the fact that the CAA-NRC plan is actually located in the fragile ethnic identity politics of the Northeast where illegal cross-border immigration has long been a sensitive political issue. That the sustained protests in Assam have received far less news coverage than the violence in Delhi is a reflection of the tyranny-of-distance syndrome where the Northeast loses out because it remains on the periphery of the national consciousness.

The truth is, the CAA-NRC combination constitutes a flagrant violation of the 1985 Assam Accord, which set 1971 as the cut-off year for “all” immigrants without distinguishing between Hindus and Muslims. It is only to reach out to a Bengali-speaking Hindu voter — both in Assam and neighbouring Bengal — that the BJP has chosen to embrace a path that could lead to a dangerous communalisation of a long-simmering ethnic conflict.

Assam and West Bengal have elections in April-May 2021. The fires in the rest of the country, in a sense, are only the fallout of a cynical political game that looks at Bengal 2021 as the next big battle to be won. Just as it was about winning an election in Sarkhej in Gujarat was all those years ago.

Post-script: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is the one Opposition politician who has offered a strong counterpoint to the Modi government’s CAA-NRC gambit. By focusing on the NRC in her protests, and warning that it’s the poor Bengali who will have to struggle to get the citizenship documents, Banerjee has added a new narrative to the debate: Bengali sub-nationalism versus Hindutva nationalism, poor versus rich and not Hindu versus Muslim.

CHANDIGARH Cornering Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for his remarks on Afghan Sikhs in the context of the Citizenship Amendment Act, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said it seemed he was more interested in dirty politicking than protecting the Constitutional ethos.

“Do you have no shame? You are ready to destroy the country’s secular character to promote your vested political interests,” said Amarinder in a statement.

“While people were getting killed in their fight to save India’s secular character and its Constitution, Sukhbir was busy indulging in politics over an issue of such grave concern. What was at stake was the very survival of the country as a democratic and secular entity,” said Amarinder.

Responding to Sukhbir’s question “if he (Amarinder) favours granting Indian citizenship to Sikhs who migrated from minorities Afghanistan,” the CM said the issue at hand was not about granting or not granting citizenship to a particular community. “The matter related to the brazen attempt of the central government to tinker with the Indian Constitution – the very bedrock of the country’s existence,” he said.

“Sukhbir claims the SAD has been fighting for the last 10 years for ensuring Indian citizenship to these people (Afghan Sikhs). Without getting into any argument over his claim, I want to ask him whether he favours exclusion of Muslims from Indian citizenship,” said the CM.

“Did the SAD not, in its initial reaction, declare that Muslims should also get the benefit of the amended Act?” the CM asked, demanding an explanation for the sudden U-turn of the Akalis on the issue.

With these contradictory statements, Sukhbir had once again exposed himself as an unprincipled leader with no morality, said Amarinder."

Updated: Nov 28, 2019 06:09 IST

Jharkhand would complete two decades of its formation in November 2020. The November-December assembly elections will be the fourth after the state was carved out of Bihar. Has politics changed fundamentally in the state after its creation?

Not so much, shows an HT analysis of election statistics from 1980 onwards. This analysis has used statistics from the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University. It has looked at 81 assembly constituencies (ACs) which were in Bihar until 2000 and were carved out to make Jharkhand. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) first contested an election in 1980.

The analysis shows that political equations which matter in Jharkhand today had started manifesting themselves before the state was created.

Even after the BJP’s entry into the electoral fray, the Congress continued to be the biggest party in terms of vote share in the 1980 and 1985 elections. The Congress received its biggest setback in the 1990 elections, when it suffered a 15 percentage point decline in vote share. To be sure, the 1985 elections were an aberration, as the Congress won a huge mandate in Bihar. A comparison with 1980 vote shares shows that the 1990 loss in Congress’s vote share was very similar to what the BJP gained in the elections.

The 1990 elections were held in the backdrop of the BJP championing the Ram Janmabhoomi issue in a big way. The damage which the Congress suffered after 1990 has been permanent. The Congress’s vote share declined even more after the creation of Jharkhand.

The Ram temple push for the BJP was greater in regions which went to Jharkhand than the parts which stayed in Bihar. This can be seen from a comparison of BJP’s seat share and vote share in these two regions.

Given this background, it is not surprising that the BJP is harping on the Ayodhya issue in a big way in the Jharkhand elections to target the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress of delaying the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya when he addressed his first election campaign rally in the state on Monday.

Rise of the BJP is not the only political story which has unfolded in Jharkhand in the last three decades. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), which was founded in 1973, has also grown along with the BJP in the state. Both the BJP and the JMM recorded their best-ever performance in terms of vote share in the 2014 assembly elections.

To be sure, the BJP has had a ten percentage point lead over the JMM since 1995 in terms of vote share in all elections except 2009. One reason why the JMM has not been able to emerge as the largest party in the state is its inability to break ground in the North Chotanagpur and Palamu regions, which account for 34 out of the 81 ACs in the state.

These two are also the two regions where the Scheduled Tribe (ST) population share is the lowest in the state. This suggests that the JMM’s main support base is among ST voters. STs account for 26% of the state’s population according to the 2011 census. The BJP made Raghubar Das the first non-ST chief minister in the history of the state in 2014, a move which was targeted at consolidating the non-ST vote. It remains to be seen whether the JMM’s alliance with the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) can help it bridge its deficit vis-à-vis the BJP in these elections."

Updated: Nov 04, 2019 20:33 IST

The manner in which the Opposition and media circles have run down the visit of members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to Kashmir shows once again how we can be our worst enemies. Already, unbridled domestic criticism of changes in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has provided abundant ammunition to anti-Indian and human rights groups abroad to castigate the Modi government.

If the Opposition cannot mute its criticism because of its external fallout, any responsible position should integrate the external dimension of an enduring national problem which involves claims on our territory, occupation of parts of it, armed conflict, externally-sponsored terrorism, and Islamisation. If the Kashmir situation had been steadily improving, with terrorism and separatism largely under control, Kashmiri politicians working at ground level to align J&K more closely with the national mainstream, preserving Sufi traditions, removing invidious social laws, developing all regions equitably, no constitutional change might have been needed. In reality, the Kashmir situation has steadily deteriorated, with ethnic cleansing, jihadi mayhem, organised stone-pelting, locals interfering with security operations, terrorists being treated as martyrs and throngs attending their funerals. A case for a surgical act to stop this national haemorrhage had become strong, with the security situation around India worsening with deepening geopolitical collaboration between China and Pakistan represented by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through PoK and Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan midwifed by Pakistan. The Opposition should not ignore these mounting regional geo-strategic pressures.

Most arguments against the MEPs’ visit have little merit. If the visit of a foreign delegation internationalises the J&K issue, then whatever our permanent representatives in New York and Geneva do to explain our case to UN member-states and blunt Pakistan’s campaign in the Human Rights Council, the foreign secretary’s briefing to foreign ambassadors in Delhi immediately after Article 370’s nullification, PM Narendra Modi’s exchanges with the UN Secretary General and various international leaders, including, most recently, German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the subject, external affairs minister’s several foreign visits and interaction with US think tanks to give the right perspective on the government’s decision, and our ambassador in Washington briefing US Congressmen on the issue (eliciting a very positive statement by the co-chairman of the India Caucus), would all amount to internationalising the Kashmir issue. Are the critics suggesting that we cease all international engagement on our internal decision on Article 370 because not doing it would internationalise it? Why not extend this argument to all our internal decisions on the economy, trade, environment and climate change issues?

The shabby way in which the democratically elected MEPs have been treated in India, denigrating them as belonging to the far Right, pro-Nazi, anti-immigration and, therefore, anti-Islamic was diplomatically most regrettable, as it was done to destroy their credibility because of Opposition fears that they may bolster the Modi government’s claim that a degree of normalcy was returning to the Valley, implicitly justifying the government’s constitutional step and blunting the Opposition’s campaign against it.

That the delegation counted for little because it was unofficial and did not represent national governments is an uninformed view. Inviting an official delegation would have actually given a handle to a foreign government to officially meddle in Kashmir, and would have internationalised the issue much more. If we had to project that the human rights campaign against us with allegations of genocide, complete lockdown of eight million Kashmiris, and lack of access to medical aid was false, engineering a foreign visit without using official channels is a well- established practice. So much of the Track-2 and Track 1.5 in which opinion-makers, including sitting Members of Parliament (MPs) participate, is done through non-governmental organisations.

The view that the MEPs visit should have happened later in time with a better selection of MPs is questionable, as the purpose was not to invite those censorious but those who oppose terrorism and Pakistan’s sponsorship of it. This first visit will not change the narrative abroad fostered by entrenched anti-Indian liberal Left lobbies drawing on similar lobbies in India who feel distressed by Modi’s success on any front.

That Indian MPs should have been first allowed to visit Kashmir is a specious argument. The Opposition MPs, who have strongly condemned the constitutional changes in J&K, are determined to do politics on the issue. Their demand to visit Kashmir would be to get more ammunition to denounce the government’s decision and highlight the grievances of those Kashmiris opposed to it. The MEPs’ visit was not to go into the constitutional and political issues involved, but was limited to assessing the human rights situation and the terrorism issue.

Is the Opposition aligned with international human rights organisations, the liberal Western press, and some US Congressional leaders attacking India on Kashmir? Do they need more on-the-spot confirmation of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and human rights violations in J&K? Will India’s secular democracy get a boost if we invited the pro-Islamist US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Jeremy Corbyn’s cronies to Kashmir?

Let us meet a national challenge collectively, without subjecting it to partisan domestic politics.

Updated: Oct 31, 2019 21:45 IST

Shiv Sena’s senior leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar even as his party continues its tussle with the BJP over government formation in Maharashtra, reports said.

“I had come to wish him on the occasion of Diwali. We also discussed the politics in Maharashtra,” Sanjay Raut said, according to news agency Asian News International.

The Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party have been locked in a bitter tussle over sharing power after they were re-elected in the October 21 state elections.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party had started the negotiations by demanding that the BJP stick to a 50-50 power-sharing formula the two parties had reportedly decided in February this year.

The BJP’s presumptive chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, has said there was no such decision to share the chief minister’s post in the state.

The BJP is offering the Shiv Sena two or three more berths in the council of ministers over the 13 slots that it has had in the 2014 edition of the alliance government, under the power-sharing formula that is under discussion between them.

The BJP has made it clear that the chief minister’s post wasn’t up for discussion. Neither are strategically important portfolios such as home, finance, revenue and urban development. It has offered public works, housing and agriculture departments, among others, to the Sena.

The negotiations to firm up the shape and format of the new government that is likely to be formed early next week will enter the home stretch over the weekend, people familiar with the development said.

The BJP won 105 seats and the Sena bagged 56 in the 288-member assembly. The opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has 54 seats while its alliance partner Congress has 44. Independents and smaller parties together — including partners of both alliances — have 29 seats."

In the first major setback to Telugu Desam Party headed by former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu after the party’s debacle in the recent elections, senior lawmaker of the party Vallabhaneni Vamsi on Sunday resigned from the primary membership of the party and also his assembly membership.

In a letter written to the TDP president, Vamsi, who represents Gannavaram assembly constituency near Vijayawada in Krishna district, also announced that he would stay away from active politics.

Interestingly, Vamsi’s resignation comes a day after he met YSR Congress party president and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy at the latter’s residence at Tadepalli on Saturday. He was accompanied by state information minister Perni Nani and civil supplies minister Kodali Nani, both of whom are his close friends.

A YSRC leader familiar with the development said Jagan had invited Vamsi into the YSRC, but asked him to resign from his assembly membership. “Though Vamsi has said he was quitting active politics, he would join the YSRC soon,” he said.

The TDP won only 23 MLAs in the 175-member state assembly, besides three out 25 MP seats. With Vamsi’s resignation, the TDP’s strength in the state assembly has come down to 22.

While thanking the TDP president for giving him an opportunity to work for the party, Vamsi said after getting elected as an MLA for the second time, he, his followers and associates had been in neck-deep troubles due to the vindictive attitude of local YSRC leaders and partisan attitude of some government employees.

He said their problems would be compounded if he continued at the helm of affairs. “Hence, I have decided to restrain myself and quit the politics to at least safeguard them, by reducing unnecessary friction and unwarranted animosity. Hence, I hereby tender my resignation from the assembly membership and primary membership of TDP party,” Vamsi said."

Updated: Oct 25, 2019 19:57 IST

The election of nine women legislators in the 90-member Haryana assembly, and 23 in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, shows very clearly how women’s representation remains a low priority for all political parties. In 2014, the figures were 13 and 20 respectively. This is so, despite the fact that there has been a steady increase in women voters in both the state and general elections — a process which should have had a positive effect on their entry into the electoral fray. In Haryana, where the Manohar Lal Khattar government has been aggressively trying to correct gender inequalities with schemes like the Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao, 32 constituencies did not field any woman at all. In fact, while parties did speak about women’s issues sporadically, there was little engagement with the question of their participation in the political system. Were it not for women from political dynasties, the number of women would be even less.

One reason social scientists ascribe to women staying away from contesting elections is the slander and abuse they face during campaigns and their lack of clout and money power. The other reason cited is lack of safety. But the argument often put forward by parties is that women lack the winnability factor. This is not true. Official data from the Election Commission collated since 1998 shows that the success rate of women and men candidates does not differ, and, in fact, women have the slight edge, all things being equal. The dismal number of women who got tickets, and who finally won in these elections, suggests that there is no inclination among political parties to bring in more women candidates. The poor figures mean that they have not been able to influence decision-making within parties despite there being powerful women leaders in many of them.

Women do not vote in homogenous blocs, and, therefore, they are seen as not powerful enough to influence outcomes. However, this may be slowly changing with the emergence of what parties see as the “woman vote”. The challenge remains equitable power-sharing. When women have got power, thanks largely to reservations, at the panchayat level, they tend to focus on crucial issues like education, health and nutrition. The problem they face is that, despite doing well at that level, they are largely ignored in the power structure at higher levels. Women are making their mark in several fields, from sports to astrophysics. It is a pity that politics is not keeping pace with society."

Updated: Oct 12, 2019 21:07 IST

In a week from now, Maharashtra and Haryana will go to polls. Elections always throw up surprises. And it is best to wait for the outcome. But all the reports emerging from both states point to one common trend.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power at the Centre and in both the states since 2014, is most likely to return to office. This could be in a coalition with the Shiv Sena (SS) in Maharashtra, and on its own in Haryana. The big question appears to be about the margin of victory. The elections may also, consequently, see the defeat of the Congress.

If this happens, what does it tell us about the underlying patterns of Indian politics?

The first conclusion is obvious. As Milan Vaishnav and Jamie Hintston of the Carnegie Endowment have argued, India is now witnessing the birth of the fourth party system. The first system was defined by Congress dominance (1952-67); the second was marked by growing opposition at the state level (1967-89); and the third saw the birth of coalition politics (1989-2014). And the fourth, since 2014, has been marked by the arrival of the BJP, under Narendra Modi, as the India’s most politically powerful, organisationally dominant, and ideologically hegemonic force. The 2019 victory showed 2014 was no mere aberration; the expansion of the party across states, social groups, and regions is now an established fact. Retaining power in Maharashtra and Haryana will once again reinforce the BJP’s dominance.

Two, it will show the power of the nationalism narrative, as projected by the BJP. As Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research has argued, nationalism has been a theme in Indian politics, but its nature has changed. If the Congress of Jawaharlal Nehru focused on both the anti-colonial and the secular, civic form of nationalism, the Congress of Indira Gandhi began to make a slow shift towards a more muscular form of nationalism, with a dash of Hindu symbolism thrown in during her later years. The BJP has promoted a more Hindu-centric form of religious nationalism. This has both elements of anti-Pakistan and anti-minority rhetoric. The post-Uri surgical strike, the Balakot air strike, and now the moves on Kashmir fit into the former; the exclusion of Muslims from the political power structure fits into the latter. Irrespective of one’s view on the desirability of this form of nationalism, it appears to have popular resonance. The Opposition has not been able to counter this. As HT reported from Haryana last week, a voter in Panipat mentioned how he wished to vote for the Congress candidate — but would not do so because the party was “anti-national”. The image, fair or not, is getting entrenched and the party will have to be creative in breaking it.

The third element is the steady expansion of the BJP among different caste groups that constitute the Hindu fold. In Haryana, the BJP, in 2014, focused on creating a coalition of non-Jat castes, resentful of Jat domination in politics. In Maharashtra, it created a substantial non-Maratha coalition, resentful of Maratha domination in politics. But in the upcoming 2019 election, while retaining its old caste groups, the BJP is aggressively wooing both Jats and Marathas too. It is also seeking to expand its presence among the Dalits, who constitute a substantial population segment in both states. If the BJP does succeed, it will once again show that the party is turning into an inclusive Hindu outfit — and that perhaps is a key reason for its success.

The fourth big message of this election is the evidence of dividends a party can reap in having both significant national and state leaders. The BJP made two unusual choices in the two states — Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar as chief ministers. Their rise was attributed to their close association with the Sangh and Modi’s patronage. But Khattar, despite stumbling on law and order, has carved out an image of being honest in a political culture known for cronyism and corruption. Fadnavis has developed an image of an effective administrator and a shrewd politician who can take along different social groups and political actors. The BJP is perceived as a centralised party apparatus under Modi and Shah. This is undoubtedly true. But what is missed in this is that the central leadership has allowed local leaders to grow. The emergence of state leaders who now have developed capabilities of their own is a highlight of this election.

The fifth strand in this election is the state of the opposition, particularly the Congress. As Salman Khurshid admitted last week, the party has failed to introspect on the reasons for its loss in the 2019 polls. In a democratic polity, wins and losses are a part of the game. This is followed by a review, necessary corrections, and revival. But Congress has not even got to the first step of understanding the root causes of its electoral debacle and steady erosion of strength. This has now trapped the party in a vicious cycle. It is out of power; it is ideologically incoherent; it has a weak national leadership; there is internal factionalism; its state leaders and workers are demotivated; and it has limited resources. All of this leads to election losses. And once the loss happens, the party gets further entrenched in the web of having even lower resources, further divisions, lower morale, a sense of fatalism about its fortunes, more confusion about the political line to pursue, and a greater exodus of leaders. Till this cycle is broken — either through a string of electoral successes or by getting the party machine back in order — it will remain stuck.

This set of elections will once again show the robustness of India’s electoral democracy. This is good news. But it will also expose the challenges that come with becoming an almost unipolar polity, where power is concentrated within a party. Irrespective of where you stand on the political spectrum, this is worrying news for democracy.

It was a surprising call but not an unfathomable one. It was going back to one of the proven performers but not a step backwards. India’s decision to bring Wriddhiman Saha back in the XI after 22 months for the first Test against South Africa at Visakhapatnam starting on Wednesday raised a few eyebrows but sent out a clear message of ‘keeper first and batsman second’ mentality in red-ball cricket.

Jeffrey Archer says his first love would always be writing but if reborn, he would want to be a bar-room singer.

After writing, the celebrated British writer’s preference has been cricket and politics. He closely follows cricket and was rooting for Somerset to win the County Championships for the first time.

Having been an MP and now a member of the House of Lords for over 27 years, Archer is also passionate about following what’s going on in politics, though he is no longer directly involved.

Archer, 79, has just come out with the first book of an eight-part series involving his new character William Warwick.

He regrets that he doesn’t have a good singing voice. But if he gets a chance to born again, he says, he would want to be a bar-room singer.

“I’ve always loved old style crooners like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, and would love to have had a good singing voice - but I don’t,” said Archer.

Another thing he loves to do is visit India and meet his fans.

On Indian cuisine, he says, “I am not a lover of anything too spicy, but have always enjoyed Indian food - both on my visits to India, and at a couple of favourite restaurants in London. My go-to dish would be chicken curry.” Archer, whose novels and short stories include Kane and Abel and Cat O’ Nine Tales, has topped the bestseller lists around the world, with sales of over 275 million copies.

Asked if he would to rework on any particular book of his, he says, “Ten years ago I rewrote ‘Kane and Abel’, as it remains one of my best-selling and best loved books, even after 40 years. I didn’t change the story at all, but felt I had become a better craftsman, so could perhaps sharpen up some of the dialogue.” According to him, he has never chased or expected awards.

“I confess that receiving an award for doing something that you love is exciting and of course satisfying, remembering how hard you’ve worked on a book, but I’ve never chased or expected awards,” he says.

“I was nevertheless, delighted to receive the International Recognition Award from the Irish Book Awards board, for having contributed substantially to the health and wealth of the Irish book-trade,” he adds.

Archer’s novel, Paths of Glory, won the Prix Relay du Roman d’Evasion, a prize that rewards a novel in which readers can ‘escape from everyday life’, and A Prisoner of Birth won the Prix Polar International at Prix Cognac Awards for Best Thriller of the Year.

Updated: Sep 29, 2019 00:02 IST

Speaking on the sidelines of the maiden St John’s All India Debate (SJAID) organised by St John’s School, Sector 26, former union minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday said appointments in public institutions should be kept free from politics.

The two-day event saw a huge participation from the alumni of the school. Sibal said, “Vice-chancellors, governors, IIT directors must not have any political inclination for getting an appointment,” regarding appointments of regional V-Cs. He added, “These are public appointments. They should have nothing to do with politics.”

The two-day mega event concluded with a performance of the National Anthem by a school club comprising 100 odd children from primary and middle classes.

The national winners of the grand trophy and a cash prize of ₹1 lakh were Tanushree Gupta and Sanidhi Singh from Mayo Girls College, Ajmer. The runners-up prize of ₹25,000 was bagged by the team from Convent of Jesus And Mary, New Delhi. The other two finalist schools were hosts St John's High School and Welham Boys’ School, Dehradun."

Updated: Sep 26, 2019 21:29 IST

With onion prices rising sharply in the past few weeks, one of the most basic contradictions in Indian political economy is manifesting itself once again. Urban consumers are unhappy to pay more for onions, which have become scarce and expensive, thanks to late sowing and rains disrupting supply chains. Political parties and governments have rushed in to both, exploit and assuage this anger. Exports have been banned, and the government is planning to offload its stocks. Such steps will bring down prices to some extent. What about farmers, though? This was their opportunity to make some windfall gains. Do remember that tepid food prices have been the biggest reason for low inflation in the last few years. Food buyers have gained at the cost of food sellers. And this has put a severe squeeze on farm incomes. Even if left unattended, the onion price rally would have reversed in some time. After all, this is not the first time onion prices have risen.

It is difficult to take sides in this debate. A large number of Indians spend almost half of their incomes on buying food items. Most of them work in the informal sector and have no price indexation for their wages. This means that many Indians are hurt badly by high food inflation. Farmers, on the other hand, are almost perpetually distressed in this country. Although often seen as unskilled and unwanted in the larger economy, they perform the crucial function of ensuring food security for the nation. It is their collective effort, despite worsening viability of farming, which has kept India immune from price volatility in international markets for most food items.

There are ways to resolve the contradiction. If farmers are denied a windfall gain by the government to keep inflation under check, then there should also be a provision to ensure that there are no windfall losses at the time of a glut. Bumper harvests are more unfair to vegetable farmers because middlemen squeeze price paid to farmers, without passing on the entire gains to consumers. What’s essential, however, is that the politics of it is discussed first. Any political party which doesn’t want to champion the idea that high food inflation is as bad as a crash in food prices is being disingenuous while making claims that it is pro-farmer."

In the forthcoming Assembly polls, Mumbaiites will elect 36 representatives who are expected to articulate their concerns in the legislative body, raise and resolve issues, and speak up for the larger good of the city. This election should happen on the back of campaigns and debates centred on issues that Mumbai faces, where opposition parties demand accountability from the government and offer alternatives. None of these are visible in Mumbai at this time.

As in the rest of Maharashtra, so in Mumbai, the election is increasingly one without a contest. The ruling BJP-Shiv Sena is sitting smug while the Congress-NCP and other parties are in disarray or dis-spirited.

Whether the BJP and Shiv Sena contest as an alliance or independent of each other, BJP’s top leaders – party president Amit Shah and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, who held high-visibility events in the last few days – have declared that Mumbai will elect all 36 of its MLAs from the saffron parties. Nothing could be worse.

In 2014, 29 of 36 MLAs were from these two parties – 15 BJP, 14 Shiv Sena – making it a near-dominance of their ideologies and policies. The Congress had only five, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the AIMIM, one each. Reports on their performance in the Assembly have been mixed as per independent policy organisations. They have been more accessible to citizens but the quality of questions they raised in the Assembly have been fewer than in the 2009-14 period. More of them have been charge-sheeted in criminal cases but public perception is that they are less corrupt than their predecessors.

The two previous Assembly compositions were more democratic. In 2009, Congress-NCP had 20 MLAs, BJP-Sena had nine, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had six, and SP, one. In 2004 when Mumbai elected 34 MLAs, Congress-NCP had 19, BJP-Sena 14. This meant that ruling party MLAs were held to account by the then opposition BJP-Sena. Citizens’ issues were articulated and turned into street agitations. The Congress-NCP could not breathe easy. In the Fadnavis-government era, it isn’t merely that the BJP-Sena enjoyed dominance; the problem is that Congress-NCP gave them an easy pass on Mumbai’s issues.

Across the city, the Congress has been in decline. Its organisational strength has reduced; its leaders pull in different directions on petty grounds, its narrative is non-cohesive. The NCP hardly registers its presence. The SP, AIMIM, and Dalit parties talk to and about their committed voters; the Aam Aadmi Party gamely tries to speak. Who demands answers of the government? Who agitates on behalf of Mumbaiites?

Crumbling infrastructure and poor flood management, collapse of bridges, pathetic condition of roads, haphazard construction of Metro lines including using Aarey Colony for a car shed, should have been the cause for massive agitations in the last few years. Now, in election season, the ruination of a cooperative bank and rising prices of onions should have brought opposition parties out in full strength. They barely issued statements. With non-articulation of issues and lack of agitations, they left Mumbai’s political space vacant over the years.

In the absence of well-articulated campaigns around voters’ concerns, the BJP, which is in permanent election campaign mode, has made the reading down of Article 370 and its version of nationalism into election issues in Maharashtra.

Amit Shah knows well that this election is about Mumbai and Maharashtra, not a parliamentary one, but he is only too happy to fill in the vacant space with his agenda. Congress and NCP reacted to Shah when they should have been pro-active.

The gradual disintegration of opposition parties has meant that not only does the contrarian or challenger voice not get reflected in the Assembly but that it is not heard on the streets either. Unipolar politics may be great for the party in power, but it spells bad news for a pluralistic and diverse city."

Canadian author Margaret Atwood said moves to limit women’s reproductive rights, particularly in the United States, led to the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale which was released on Tuesday in a hotly-anticipated cultural event.

The Testaments sees Atwood pick up the story from her 1985 account of a totalitarian future in which fertile women are forced into sexual servitude to repopulate a world facing environmental disaster.

She said she had not planned a sequel to the story, which was set in fictional Gilead in the U.S. region of New England in the near future, but real-life political events, including moves to limit women’s reproductive rights, led her to reconsider.

“As time moved on ... instead of moving further away from Gilead, we started moving towards it - particularly in the United States,” Atwood told a press conference in London.

Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in U.S. politics, with opponents often citing religious belief to call it immoral while abortion-rights advocates call restrictions encroachment on women’s medical choices and harmful to health.

President Donald Trump, who says he opposes abortions in most cases, has joined many of his fellow Republicans in seeking to curtail access to legal abortions.

The Handmaid’s Tale has long been hailed as a touchstone for feminist campaigners, with Atwood saying all the acts of repression in the fictional totalitarian state of Gilead were based on real-life events.

Fans in Britain queued at midnight to buy The Testaments after publishers maintained tight security in the lead-up to Tuesday’s release.

Reviewers were sent copies with a fake title and cover but secrecy around the book’s plot was breached after Amazon accidentally sent out some pre-ordered copies.

The Testaments has already been shortlisted for one of the literary world’s top awards, the Booker Prize, with judges’ chairman Peter Florence praising it as “a savage and beautiful novel that speaks to us today with conviction and power”.

Reviews on Tuesday were mixed. Many praised as it fast-paced and dramatic, but some argued it lacks the depth of the original novel that shot back into the best-selling list after being made into a popular TV series starring Elisabeth Moss.

Atwood, who turns 80 in November, won the Booker Prize for her 2000 novel The Blind Assassin.

Updated: Sep 10, 2019 15:55 IST

Actress-turned-politician Urmila Matondkar quit the Congress on Tuesday afternoon barely six months after joining the party. She blamed petty in-house politics and held the party leadership responsible for not putting in reasonable efforts to put its house in order.

Matondkar, who fought the Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North constituency, said that she was feeling betrayed by the Congress leadership. “My political and social sensibilities refuse to allow vested interests in the party to use me as a mean to fight petty in-house politics instead of working on a bigger goal in Mumbai Congress,” she said

In July, Matondkar’s letter to then Mumbai Congress chief Milind Deora had surfaced where she made scathing comments against trusted aides of her senior colleague Sanjay Nirupam.

Matondkar said that the leaders whom she had held responsible for her defeat in her letter to Deora were given new responsibilities. She also pointed out that her letter, sent on May 16 and meant for Deora, was “leaked”. Milind Deora has resigned as the Mumbai Congress unit chief. He has been replaced by Eknath Gaikwad.

Matondkar has however said that she will stick to her thoughts and ideologues hinting that she might not join any other political party. She had recently visted the flood-affected Kolhapur and Sangli regions of Maharashtra.

Nirupam had hit out at Deora after Matondkar’s letter became public. “Young leader who desires to stabilise party at national level has released copies of complaint letter of an LS candidate to media houses to publish it. It was addressed to him against party workers after election. Is this the way he is going to adopt to stabilise the party,” Nirupam had tweeted.

Deora had hit back saying that a party and its ideals are bigger than one individual. “Some unpleasant and unwarranted commentary from certain quarters should be ignored and not countered. The Congress party has seen many upheavals and shall overcome this one too,” he had said in a statement.

Deora, a former Union minister, had replaced Nirupam as the Mumbai Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in April-May. Both had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from South Mumbai and Mumbai North West respectively."

Updated: Sep 04, 2019 19:02 IST

The midday meal controversy in Uttar Pradesh where a journalist alleged that children were being given substandard meals, and its fall out, whatever the merits or demerits of the case, is one in a long list of controversies which have plagued the scheme since it was universalised in 2001. Tamil Nadu was the one state which had the foresight to have started the scheme earlier with positive results for enrolment and retention in schools.

Some years ago, I visited a midday meal kitchen run by the NGO Naandi Foundation in Hyderabad, one of many it ran at that time. The food was steamed cooked in large steel vats, eliminating the need for oil; small additions like fresh soy milk and pickles were included to the menu after the NGO found that the children liked the taste of these. Most of all, the scheme was flexible enough to allow the children to take home bits of leftover food for their younger siblings. Local women were engaged to prepare the raw material for the meals and clean the kitchens. The NGO ensured that the meals were not monotonous, and incorporated different vegetables and dals every day. On the odd occasions, a dessert would be added to the meal. The retention rate in schools which availed of the scheme was spectacular.

The midday meal is perhaps the single biggest achievement in the school system in India. Apart from increasing enrolment and retention, it has brought down hunger, and promoted health and cognitive abilities in children. There is simply nothing that anyone can find that is wrong with it, if you leave out the politics.

But as with all good schemes, several extraneous considerations come into play. In some states, ostensibly due to religious reasons, eggs were done away with, although this is a vital nutritional addition to the midday meal scheme. Several experts believe that the addition of milk and eggs in the meal is invaluable in a country where many children suffer from stunting as a result of poor nutrition in childhood. But the arguments against eggs and milk have included these food items being difficult to transport — in the case of eggs, it being easily breakable, and in the case of milk, it being prone to spoiling and contamination. It is passing strange that state governments which run the schemes are unwilling to take the responsibility of preventing such spoiling, breakage and contamination. The other foolish argument is that serving eggs would make vegetarian children uncomfortable.

The answer should be simple: they should be given an alternative, but surely no one has a right to object to a food item that some children may wish to eat. A popular NGO which serves midday meals across the country refuses to serve food which includes onions and garlic on religious grounds. It also refuses to include eggs on the menu. But, surely the primary concern must be that the meal served should be tasty and nutritious for the child and not the religious beliefs of the provider. It is here that the state governments should step in and insist that the providers should keep their beliefs aside, and do what is best for the child.

Other counterproductive tinkering with the system is the proposal to provide the child with uncooked grains and lentils to take home. This cannot guarantee that the child will actually get the food, especially the girl child whose nutritional needs are often overlooked in a patriarchal society. A former minister for women and child development argued long and hard for packaged food on the grounds that it was more hygienic and less prone to any form of contamination. Now, that may well be so, but a hot meal is what a growing child needs, and that too something to suit his or her taste. The success of Tamil Nadu has not been in just implementing the midday meal scheme across the state but in providing food that the child is familiar with.

In the case of the Hyderabad NGO I visited, some children had actually started bringing their smaller siblings to the school premises, where they would play in the grounds until the meal was served and get a small portion of the leftover food. This served two purposes: it provided some nutrition to the child who was not yet in school and created a favourable environment for enrolment at home, and it freed up the school-going child from having to stay home to help care for the smaller child.

This is one scheme which successive governments ought to be proud of. The endeavour now should be to work to make it even more attractive by incorporating food that children relate to, and ensuring that when it comes to the health and educational progress of children, politics does not become the spoiler.

Updated: Aug 31, 2019 09:58 IST

The final list of National Register of Citizens (NRC), aimed at identifying illegal immigrants in Assam that borders Bangladesh, will be out on Saturday (August 31).

The Supreme Court-monitored NRC exercise was carried out only in Assam, which faced influx of people from Bangladesh for decades. The process of identification of illegal immigrants in the state has been widely debated and become a contentious issue in the state politics.

Here’s a look at issues which marred the process to update the register:

Political agenda

All Assam Students Union (AASU), the state’s biggest student body, has accused the BJP of pushing its political agenda instead of greater good of Assamese people. AASU had led the 1979-1985 Assam Agitation against foreigners that saw 855 deaths and culminated in signing of the Assam Accord.

“Earlier BJP used to blame Congress of appeasing Muslims for vote-bank politics. Now they are doing the same with Hindus. We should respect the NRC process, which is being monitored by SC, but instead of a permanent solution, the BJP wants to keep the foreigners issue alive,” said AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.

All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) has also questioned the BJP’s motives.

“We are surprised at the statements of BJP leaders ahead of the final list. Instead of closing the foreigners issue with publication of an error-free NRC, they want to keep it alive for electoral benefits,” AIUDF general secretary Aminul Islam said.

Congress state president Ripun Bora accused BJP leaders of spreading misinformation even before publication of the final NRC and urged the Sonowal government to take action against them.

Credibility

Political parties, especially the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Assam, have questioned the list’s credibility saying it might not be error-free.

“Persons declared foreigners are involved in the NRC updating process while people who were part of Assam agitation and even the Independence movement have got excluded (from the drafts released earlier). So how can we be satisfied with such a list?” questioned Assam BJP chief Ranjeet Dass earlier this week.

The BJP is upset with alleged exclusions of ‘genuine Indian citizens’ and inclusion of ‘foreigners’ in the list.

Push for CAB

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal has indicated that his government might adopt legislative measures to correct “anomalies” in the final NRC after it is published. While he didn’t specify the measures, it is speculated that it could mean the Centre could once again bring in the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. The bill had earlier lapsed in February this year after it failed to make it to the Rajya Sabha.

If passed, the bill, which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, could pave the way for Hindus from Bangladesh who came to India after March 24, 1971 (the cut-off date for NRC) to get included in NRC.

Opposition parties think BJP, which had earlier made claims to throwing out illegal immigrants if it came to power, is not serious about doing that and is trying to prolong the issue for political gain.

A case of missing people

NRC in Assam became a raging controversy in West Bengal after nearly 4 million people, predominantly Hindu Bengalis, found their names missing in the final draft released in July last year.

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had claimed that the NRC exercise was carried out with a “political motive” to divide people and warned that it would lead to “bloodbath” and a “civil war” in the country.

Banerjee had also said those “Indian citizens have become refugees in their own land”. Banerjee alleged the NRC was an “attempt to evict the Bengalis from Assam”.

‘Data leak’

The Congress had accused the Assam government of contempt of a Supreme Court order after detailed figures of the district wise break-up of NRC draft inclusions and exclusions was released by a cabinet minister in the state assembly. Leader of Opposition in state assembly Debabrata Saikia had questioned how the state government got access to the figures.

In the order, the SC had said confidential reports submitted by NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela should remain in the custody of court owing to sensitive nature of information in those reports which may affect the exercise. It directed Hajela not to share any information pertaining to NRC with “executive, legislature of judicial authority of the state without leave of the court.” The district wise inclusion and exclusion figures were submitted to the court in August 2018 in a sealed cover.

‘Should put you in jail’

The Supreme Court had threatened to send the NRC coordinator and registrar general of India to jail for contempt and restrained them from speaking on the politically charged issue to the media without its approval.

A bench of justice Ranjan Gogoi and justice RF Nariman said the statements made by NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela and registrar general Sailesh on the issue of dealing with claims and objections of those who have been left out in the draft NRC were “most unfortunate”.

“We should be holding both of you guilty of contempt and sending both of you to jail. Whatever you say they all reflect on us,” the top court, which is monitoring the NRC, said.

“Your job is not to go to press holding the brief for somebody,” the bench said.

Exclusion of army, BSF officials

The names of several serving and retired defence and Border Security Force personnel from Assam were among the 40 lakh people missing from the controversial document. The Supreme Court had even asked the NRC coordinator to ensure that a fair procedure is adopted in dealing with the claims and objections filed by those excluded from the list.

Delays

Both the Assam government and the Centre have been at the receiving end of the Supreme Court’s ire over delays in publishing of the NRC as well as identification and deportation of foreigners from the state."

Updated: Aug 24, 2019 15:50 IST

Arun Jaitley may have been battling with prolonged illness, but nothing could keep him away from taking part in the political discourse. Till the time he was admitted to the AIIMS where he breathed his last on Saturday, Jaitley continued tweeting.

In his last tweet he paid his tributes to the Hindu poet-saint Swami Tulsidas before tweeting how heartbroken he was at the demise of his cabinet colleague Sushma Swaraj, who passed away at the AIIMS following a cardiac arrest on August 6.

But it was his series of tweets on August 6 on the abrogation of Article 370 that offer a glimpse of his deep political insight. Even when he was away from active politics owing to his critical health condition, he could hardly keep himself from commenting on issues that mattered.

In a thread of 10 tweets, Jaitley congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for nullifying Article 370.

“Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Home Minister Shri Amit Shah achieved the Impossible with the new Kashmir policy. In my blog today, I have analysed the impact of this decision, and history of failed attempts on resolving the Jammu and Kashmir issue,” the former Finance Minister had said.

Elaborating further, Jaitley said, “The Jammu & Kashmir history of the past seven decades shows that the journey of this Separate status has been towards separatism and not integration. It created a separatist psyche. Pakistan was more than enthusiastic in trying to exploit the situation.”

Jaitley then delved into the history of militancy in the valley, saying, “By 1989-90, the situation of Jammu and Kashmir had gone out of control and separatism with terrorism picked up. Kashmiri pundits, an essential part of Kashmiriat, suffered such atrocities which only the Nazis had inflicted in the past. The ethnic cleansing took place and they had to move out.”

Jaitley went on to describe Article 370 as a historical blunder, “The historic blunders of special status had cost the country politically and financially. Today, when history is being re-written, it proves that Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s vision on Kashmir was the correct one and Panditji’s dream solution has proved to be a failure.”

The tweets also show that he believed that the Jammu and Kashmir situation could only be resolved with an alternative approach adopted by the Prime Minister.

“In the last seven decades, attempts to resolve the issue proved a disaster, PM Modi decided to follow an alternative approach. The present decision makes it clear that just as the rule of law prevails in other parts of the country, it will equally prevail in the Kashmir valley,” read another tweet.

He then highlighted how Kashmir was changing, saying, “The last ten months have not seen any protest. Not even in Srinagar. Law and order enforcement, making life safe for lakhs of Kashmiris and pressuring handful of separatists and terrorists, has been at its best. The next logical step obviously is total integration of the State.”

“The decision to reverse the situation created by Panditji needed clarity, vision and determination. It also needed political courage. The Prime Minister has created history through his absolute clarity and determination,” the ailing politician said, taking a dig at the Congress.

His attacks on the grand old party continued, “India’s most beautiful State has not had investments from even the hotel chains. Consequently, there are no new jobs, no revenue for the State. These constitutional provisions are not cast in stone. They had to be removed/diluted through the due process of law that is done now” he said and added that several opposition parties except for the Congress had understood the wisdom of the move to remover special status for Jammu and Kashmir.

“The level of support has compelled several opposition parties to support this move. They sensed the ground reality and do not want to face the wrath of the people. Regrettably, the Congress Party legacy, which first created the problem and then added to it, fails to see reason,” he said in a stinging criticism of Congress’s stance.

Ailing, feeble but outspoken as always, Arun Jaitley ended the Twitter thread with a bang, “Congress Party, as a ‘headless chicken,’ is further consolidating its alienation from the people of India. The New India has changed. Only the Congress does not realise this. The Congress leadership is determined to succeed in its race to the bottom.”

As condolences poured in for the 66-year-old politician, these last 12 tweets will be the embodiment of his sharp political acumen and conviction."

Updated: Aug 24, 2019 10:47 IST

Google on Friday told employees to focus on work instead of heated debates about politics with colleagues at the internet company, which has long been known for encouraging people to speak their minds.

Updated workplace guidelines for “Googlers” called on them to be responsible, helpful, and thoughtful during exchanges on internal message boards or other conversation forums.

“While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not,” the updated guidelines stated.

“Our primary responsibility is to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.”

The updated guidelines pointed out that comments made internally by Google employees, no matter the intent, could go public and be wrongly attributed to the company, leading to mistaken impressions.

“We’re all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company’s activities -- that’s part of our culture,” the guidelines read.

“Take care not to make false or misleading statements about Google’s products or business that could undermine trust in our products and the work that we do.”

Managers or those moderating forums were directed to intervene if the policy is violated, revoking comments, ending discussions, or even taking disciplinary action.

US President Donald Trump revived his criticism of Google this month, referencing a fired engineer who claimed the internet giant was working against his re-election.

The comments were the latest from the US leader alleging, without evidence, that Silicon Valley giants distort searches and social feeds to suppress conservatives.

Trump has assailed Google on several occasions, claiming bias against him and his supporters.

Google repeated its response that these claims are baseless.

“The statements made by this disgruntled former employee are absolutely false,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the fired engineer.

“We go to great lengths to build our products and enforce our policies in ways that don’t take political leanings into account.”

In recent years, Google employees have challenged the company on issues including sexual harassment in the workplace; bidding on contracts with US defense or immigration agencies; and the potential for tailoring its online search engine for use on China’s heavily censored internet."
https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-distinguishes-family-run-businesses-and-dynastic-politics/story-gBXWKhDQz40dSQkfhOsVFO.html,9/4/2019 19:02,politics,What distinguishes family-run businesses and dynastic politics,"analysis

Updated: Jul 21, 2019 18:19 IST

In the recently concluded Indian elections, one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign themes was the need for India to move beyond dynastic politics. Families are present in all political parties in India, but in many, they are in control of the party. Equally, a majority of the top 500 companies in India are family businesses. But is the logic of family predominance in politics and business the same? If not what defines the difference?

Let us take politics first. Other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left parties, most political parties are “controlled” by families - the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena (SS), to name a few.

Max Weber had distinguished three types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority – charismatic, traditional and legal authority. He defined authority as power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. He averred that charismatic authority grew out of the personal charm or strength of the individual, people obeyed the leader because they believe in him or her. This authority sustains as long as people believe in the leader, and does not sustain post the death of the leader unless converted into the other forms mentioned – traditional or legal authority. Traditional authority emanates from tradition or custom - a monarchy, clan leader, dominant elite, chosen successor, or family eldest. Legal authority stems from the legal office that a leader holds, an authority that goes when the leader leaves office.

In this classification, parties like the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BSP or are led by charismatic leaders and depend solely on them. This was also the case with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, under the late J Jayalalithaa. Parties that are family-led like the Congress, the SP, the DMK, and the SS are based on traditional authority and survive as long as the tradition stays strong, and the party leaders have enough patronage to dispense to their supporters. The reason family-led parties rarely convert to legal authority is because the family wants to stay in power, and is threatened by any institution that may challenge the family’s authority. They only allow a second line to develop from within the family, and trust only members of the family not to usurp their power. The moment the family members lose their charisma, or their ability to succeed and offer their retainers patronage, the party starts to weaken. It fails to rejuvenate unless transformed.

Finally, parties like the BJP and the Left ones are based on legal authority. Legal authority is more stable but needs to have a vision to offer its supporters. It needs to persuade people to believe in the underlying ideology that it espouses. If its ideology loses its appeal, or if its leaders do not ignite their supporters, then the party either adjusts its ideological moorings to the times or faces decline. The party leader enjoys authority only as long as they retain their office.

This defines the challenge for families in politics. The advantage of traditional power after the charismatic leader goes cannot sustain, unless either the children are charismatic, or subject themselves to legal authority where the hold of the family diminishes and then declines.

In contrast, the logic for family-run businesses is quite different. Once a business is established by the founder, the business becomes the wealth as well as occupation for the family. The wealth and prestige of the family is linked to the success of the business. The family does not need a mass following, only business acumen, to sustain and grow the business.

Each succeeding generation of the family has a choice that their counterparts in politics do not – they can manage their involvement in the family business differently. They can choose between being passive owners, activist investors sitting on the Board of their companies, or being active owner-managers. This is in stark contrast to politics, where family members are either completely in or out.

The dominant choice in India is for families to be owner-managers of their businesses.

There is a common belief that family businesses tend not to survive beyond the third generation. While there is some truth in this statement, it is a bit unfair because most non-family businesses also don’t survive beyond 60 years, and it is not that there are no family businesses that have survived beyond this time. Further the performance of owner-managed businesses compares quite favourably to non-family run businesses.

There are many methods to prepare the next generation in a family for business. It is easy to instil the values of the family in the next generation. They grow up in an environment where dinner conversations are about the business. They have a longer-term view about their business, and are more deeply committed to the business than other employees. They can be trained, mentored to understand their industry, taught about their sector and given lessons on how to manage employees. If they are open (and if the family desires), their performance “can” be measured objectively and feedback can be provided for development.

This is not to say that family businesses do not face their own challenges. Interests start to diverge among the children, and conflicts arise on account of wealth sharing, succession, and capital allocation. As families become larger and shareholding gets fragmented, decision rights and shareholdings start to diverge. Unless the family sets in place a family charter and a governance structure before the disputes begin, the challenge of keeping the family business intact become harder. Family businesses can survive and succeed overtime if the family leaders pay careful attention on how to manage the family with fairness, transparency, and by instilling a meritocratic value structure that distinguishes between management and ownership so that the business can be well-managed.

The political family in a democracy does not have the same advantage; charisma is not easy to pass on; and legal authority challenges the primacy of the family. Modi’s attack on undeserving dynasts amply demonstrated this in our election. In the end, the role and success of a family in business and politics is very different. Families should introspect and recognise that success is earned and not assumed.

Updated: Jul 01, 2019 08:50 IST

“It’s the economy, stupid”, a phrase coined by campaign strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, was never synonymous with the Indian elections until 2019. For developed countries, the economy has always been the fulcrum of politics. In India, “voters do not cast their vote, but they vote their caste” is a popular saying. The 2019 elections have introduced a new narrative — good economics is good politics through social empowerment.

Putting the citizen first is the guiding principle of good governance. It is this ideology that brings stakeholders, the government and the citizens closer to each other. Good governance is the key to a country’s prosperity and progress. For this to happen, it is important that the citizens become active participants in governance. Swachh Bharat is a textbook example.

The redressal of public grievances assures the citizens that their vote has not gone wasted. Technology is an important tool for good governance as it ensures transparency and accountability which result in the betterment and welfare of all citizens. It also leads to the simplification of processes. The best example is the self-certification of startups introduced by the Narendra Modi government, exhibiting trust in their citizens. Digital India ensures that government services are available to the citizen with little human interference.

These features of good governance were the hallmark of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance-I government. Social empowerment, which came through good economics, is now good politics.

Voters choose a stable government with a strong, decisive leadership. Now, development has become the buzzword. With the coming of age of social media, people can make more informed choices in many areas. Understanding this, Modi has mastered the skill of optimising social media as a tool to connect with the people.

For the first time, we are seeing a government that is determined to improve the socioeconomic status of the people. Niti Aayog selected 100 districts and called them Aspirational Districts, focusing on health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development. These core areas have a direct bearing on the quality of life and the economic productivity of citizens. The prime minister himself, along with the Niti Aayog, monitors the outcomes on a continuous basis with the state governments.

In Uttar Pradesh, eight backward districts have been selected as aspirational: Balrampur, Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharth Nagar, Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Fatehpur and Chitrakoot. They are already showing positive results. Such microplanning has never been seen in Indian political governance. Known popularly as the “Modi Development Model”, it was adopted by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath. A state once known for bad roads, negligible electricity, the lack of doctors and teachers, farmers burdened with loans, and poor law and order, has turned around by adopting good economics with good politics. Within a year, the Adityanath government had received proposals worth Rs 4.68 lakh crore. Uttar Pradesh is gradually becoming the favourite stop for investors in India.

The new narrative for political parties has become development. The focus of voters is now performance and the economy has become an undisputable way to indicate growth and success. The electorate feels a direct connect to something tangible. The 2019 elections have given a new dimension to the phrase, good economics is good politics, but via social empowerment.

Updated: Jun 30, 2019 13:07 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi replied to controversies over his Kedarnath trip and the last “Mann ki Baat” apart from reminding his listeners of the importance of upholding democracy and reading books.

His radio address began with a clarification on his trip to Kedarnath shrine before the last phase of general elections. He said it was not a political trip but an opportunity for him to meet himself.

“Most people saw political meaning in it, but for me, it was an opportunity to meet my inner self. In one way it helped me fill the void left by ‘Mann ki Baat’ in the interim,” PM said

PM also rejected allegations that he had used February episode of “Mann ki Baat” -- last before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls-- to make a poll pitch.

“People had given political meaning to my promise to return on “Mann ki Baat,” after polls. Critics called it ‘over confidence’ but it was your confidence that has aided my return. I couldn’t have come back on my own unless you invited me,” he said

PM also spoke about the Emergency in 1977 and how fundamental rights were trampled during this period while emphasising the importance of polls in upholding democracy. “Every citizen during the Emergency felt like he had lost something,” he said.

“Democracy is about respecting every single voter,” he added, recounting how electoral officers travelled for two days to set up a polling booth for a single woman residing in a remote Himachal location in the just concluded Lok Sabha polls.

PM Narendra Modi said he was happy to see a positive response to his previous request --to inculcate a habit of reading books-- made to all his listeners. He said he was recently gifted a book of Premchand’s popular stories and it reminded him of the social challenges he grappled with in his youth.

PM Narendra Modi’s radio programme “Mann Ki Baat” resumed today almost a month after the PM returned to power. This was the first ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme in Modi’s second consecutive term as the Prime Minister."

The morning of September 2012 is still fresh in my mind. Hindi lovers from all over the world had gathered in Johannesburg. I was presiding over the media session of the 10th World Hindi Conference. Mani Shankar Aiyar was the chief guest. In his speech, Aiyar had said that nothing could be as good as a person from Bihar arriving in a village in Tamil Nadu and people there asking him in Hindi, “Bhai kaise ho?” Similarly, if a Tamilian were to go to a village in Bihar and be asked, “Neeng epdi irikel?”

There are two reasons why I still remember those moments- first that I realised that Aiyar was absolutely right in what he was saying. He is from Tamil Nadu though he was born in Lahore. Besides Tamil and Hindi, he is conversant in Punjabi and Urdu. How I wish, other Indians knew one or more Indian language besides their mother tongue.

After the session was over, some young people emerged from the crowd and asked me where Mani Shankar Aiyar was. One of them asked why Aiyar felt Hindi speakers should know Tamil. I again asked what their response would be if a Tamil speaker spoke in Hindi. They said it was the duty of every citizen of the country to know Hindi.

Languages and dialects are like those relatives whom we accept at our own will and who cannot be imposed on us.

In 1937, when the government was formed in Madras Presidency, C Gopalachari made the use of Hindi mandatory in schools. Periyar and many pro-Tamil leaders were vocal in their protest. The movement became violent. The police had to use force in many places and some lives were lost. From then on, Tamil parties have resented Hindi.

Our Parliament was also affected. After much debate, the Official Language Resolution was passed in 1968. As per the resolution, Hindi-speaking states had to teach an Indian language besides Hindi and in non-Hindi speaking states, Hindi was to be taught besides English and the local or regional language. This three-language formula was accepted by everyone but Tamil Nadu was adamant.

In 1971, when I took admission in the 6th standard, I was given three options for languages. Telugu, Kannada or Bangla? We lived in Tagore town in Allahabad those days where a large number of Bengalis lived. I opted for Bangla and for the next three years I got the opportunity to understand the language. While writing these lines I can say proudly that this also awakened an interest in reading the immortal literature of Bengal.

Now we come to the present day. When the Central government saw the resentment increasing it explained that it did not want to impose Hindi on anyone. Politics has always followed the policy of one step forward two steps back as far as languages are concerned. When the Hindi-speakers of our generation were growing up, Lohiya had launched the ‘angrezi hatao’ (remove English) movement. Many people boycotted English. It felt good to hear that if Soviet Russia, China, France or Germany could progress so much without English, then India too could grow with Hindi? But this only damaged us. Hindi speakers faced difficulties in getting employment and found themselves at a disadvantage on many other fronts because they didn’t know English well. In exactly the same way, Tamil speakers faced more problems than people from Karnataka or unified Andhra Pradesh when they came to Delhi or any other part of the country. We should love our own language, but if we close the doors on other languages, we are shutting out so much knowledge.

The census of 2011 is an eye-opener. In the beginning of that decade, the number of Hindi speakers and those who could understand Hindi was over 52 crores. This number increased by 10 crores from 2001 to 2011. The biggest reason for the increase which will continue is that people are now moving on to the emerging metropolitan cities in search of employment opportunities. According to the previous data, the number of people speaking Hindi, Oriya and Assamese in the southern regions has increased by 33%. Clearly, after commercial activities increased in the cities of Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Surat, people from the east and north have started coming and settling down in these cities.

One aspect which is often forgotten is the contribution of our Bollywood films. Hindi films which are produced in Mumbai, considered to be a Hindi-speaking city have played a significant role in spreading the language all over the country. There was a time when we knew of actors like Rajinikanth, Mohan Lal, Rekha, Hema Malini or Sridevi only through these films. Now with the changing times, the cinema from the south has also been becoming popular. Baahubali was dubbed in Hindi also and it broke all box office records.

It’s clear that the caravan of languages has moved forward like this and will continue to do so. Indians don’t really need politicians to guide us on this.

One of the senior BJP leaders of Bihar and state’s health minister, Mangal Pandey played a key role as the party in-charge in its emphatic victory in Jharkhand, where the BJP won 12 out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats while fighting a united Opposition. Earlier, Pandey had steered the party in the assembly polls to a phenomenal return to power in Himachal Pradesh. In an interview to Subhash Pathak, he says Jharkhand had overcome the era when political parties used to exploit the people’s sentiments in the name of a separate state from Bihar. Excerpts:

How could you make the Jharkhand contest almost one-sided?

After successive defeats of the BJP in the state’s bypolls, I was given an impression that it was difficult to retain all 12 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand. Soon after I was made the in-charge, I started following the action plan stipulated by BJP chief Amit Shah and relied on achievements of the Central and state governments to win over people. Leaders of our coalition partners, including All Jharkhand Students’ Union , Janata Dal United (JDU) and Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) helped us carry the positive message to the masses.

Was there any special strategy after the BJP’s debacle in the recent bypolls?

After assuming the charge of Jharkhand, I held rounds of meetings with party workers from booth to the state level. My 30 years of experience of working with the party helped me identify issues. My efforts lifted morale of the workers, who finally delivered the good for the party and the nation.

The opposition led by the Congress was united and trying to play it up against the state government. Did you expect such a landslide?

There was a basic different between 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Contrary to 2014 polls, all opposition parties like Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) got united and sought to project the alliance like a major force. Sensing their strategy, BJP put all its resources to apprise the masses about the schemes of central and the state governments, ensured they were implemented on time and their benefits reached the last person. People were made to realize that the BJP was the only party that could cater to the present needs of the country.

Did Pulwama attack on CMPF convey and Balakot air strike help the BJP

override the opposition’s unity?

It is for the first time that nationalism grew up as a major political issue, when people began crying for all out war against terror and national security, rising above all caste, social and sectarian lines. A perception was built among the people that the nation is first for one and all. And it worked to mobilize the electors in support of the BJP and the NDA.



In the BJP’s wave, political stalwarts of Jharkhand like JMM chief Sibu Soren and JVM-P president Babulal Marandi were swept aside. What does it signify for Jharkhand?

JMM founder Shibu Soren should have taken retirement from active politics, as he had crossed the age. And his defeat in his stronghold of Dumka made it amply clear. The way Babulal Marandi faced massive defeat in Koderma, it seems people made him to take voluntary retirement. People of Jharkhand also taught a lesson to Congress. They are unwilling to accept a non-resident Jharkhandi to head the party."

Updated: May 25, 2019 19:57 IST

BJP chief Amit Shah on Saturday hailed the Lok Sabha election results as a testimony of people choosing politics of performance over politics of ‘dynasty, casteism and appeasement’.

“After the sixties, democracy in this country was under the grip of dynasty politics, casteism and appeasement. It is for the first time in 2019 that the country has pushed these things out of politics and has reposed faith in politics of performance,” he said addressing the NDA Parliamentary Parliamentary in the Central Hall of Parliament after election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as leader of the NDAPP to head the government again.

Shah thanked all the allies and the MPs for unanimously choosing Modi as prime minister again and said, “This euphoric mandate is massive and historic. After 1971, for the first time, a Prime Minister is returning to the post with an even bigger majority after completing a first five-year term.”

He also asserted that Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister of the country exemplified the spirit of the constitution.

“After Modi became Prime Minister, the poorest of Indian felt that the spirit of the Constitution can turn into reality and a person from poor background become Prime Minister. It was a Narendra Modi experiment when people wanted him to replicate the development model of Gujarat in the whole country. This experiment of people has been successful.”

Shah outlined various people-centric initiatives of the NDA governments first term and said, “The 50 crore poor who were looking for their place in the country’s system were previously not able to find it. In the five years, Narendra Modi has uplifted the 22 crores poor of the country and it is their blessing which has come as this historic mandate.”

He also talked about the surgical strikes, while criticising those who questioned it the first time.

“When the first surgical strike happened, people felt that a government has come which can answer the country’s enemies inside their homes. Initially the defence pundits of the country called surgical strike as a fluke but after Pulwama attack the air force personnel’s took the revenge through air-strike”, said Shah.

Shah also said that it is people’s expectation to see India emerge as a world power and hopefully same will happen in the second term of the Modi led NDA government.

Earlier during the NDA meeting, Narendra Modi was elected as the leader of the NDA.

He was greeted by SAD’s Parkash Singh Badal, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar, BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari after being elected as the leader of NDA and BJP at the NDA meeting.

Modi-led NDA swept the elections and won 352 out of 542 seats in the 17th Lok Sabha elections. In the official count, the BJP has secured 303 seats, 22 more than in 2014 elections. (ANI)"

Haryana was among the states where Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Lok Sabha polls and won all 10 seats. The BJP won seven seats in 2014. Haryana chief Manohar Lal Khattar spoke to Rajesh Moudgil about the BJP’s clean sweep. Edited excerpts:

How would you describe the outcome ?

It showed the people have disregarded politics of family, regional discrimination, nepotism and favouritism.

What significance does it have for you and your party?

It is of immense significance for the party in Haryana as our candidates primarily fought in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his leadership. It [the victory] will be a big morale booster for the party workers and leaders as each one of us played their part.

What are your plans for the upcoming assembly polls?

We have worked hard to bring complete transparency and fairness in the functioning of the state government and we would further improve this in our next term. Though we have no plans for early assembly polls, it is up to the Election Commission to decide the dates as states like Maharashtra and Jharkhand are due for assembly polls around the same time."

At HT, our data coverage of the 2019 general elections has been driven by two basic principles. Indian elections are best understood by taking a state-wise approach, given the linguistic and other socio-economic diversities in our country. And, politics needs to be seen as a continuous process between the 2014 and the 2019 general elections, rather than assuming that there has been a five-year vacuum between the two. We believe that a careful analysis of these two factors can allow us to put the 2019 results in a macro-yet-disaggregated perspective. Along with this, we have also tried to use the elections to explore some larger political economy ideas that have an important role in shaping the political processes of our country. Here’s a recap of some of our important stories that we have done as part of our national election coverage.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the schedule for 2019 general elections on March 10. In their first data story (https://bit.ly/30BtwRo) after the polls were officially announced, we gave a snapshot of how decimating the Congress in direct contest states and forging a multi-class, multi-caste collation helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha in 2014. The story also looked at parliamentary constituency (PC) wise extrapolated results from assembly elections held between 2014 and 2019.

Another story on March 19 underlined the importance of states vis-à-vis the first-past-the-post system, where regional parties in bigger states such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu end up getting a relatively higher seat share for a given vote share compared to national parties. The story also pointed out the importance of nine states – Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat – in the seat tally of the BJP in the country.

We also looked at political data in each specific state to explain the importance of various factors including alliance arithmetic in shaping the 2019 results. Some of our work underlined the importance of looking differently even within a state, such as a May 2 story that explained the relatively higher vulnerability of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh vis-à-vis the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) alliance.

An April 3 story on Karnataka tried to explain how the impressive headline vote share numbers of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) alliance in Karnataka might not lead to a rout of the BJP in the state.

Voter turnouts are the only authentic data that is available for analysis when the election process in on. In his April 28 story, Kawoosa pointed out the Kashmir valley was headed for lowest voter turnout in two decades. The final numbers, a turnout of 18.9% in the three PCs in the Kashmir valley have confirmed the argument.

Another story on May 8 pondered on whether the relatively higher increase in voter turnout in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan pointed towards a restoration of political competition in the state unlike 2014, when a section of anti-BJP voters might not have come out to vote expecting imminent defeat.

The 2019 election is the first in which the EC has decided to introduce candidate pictures along with their electoral symbols on the electronic voting machines. In this March 18 story Kawoosa scraped ECI data to show the extent of problems caused by namesake candidates in elections.

Elections in India also generate a lot of focus on the importance of caste in the country. This March 27 story cautioned readers about relying too much on headline caste demographic numbers even at the state level.

Another April 4 story tried to explain the complicated relationship between caste and class in Indian politics by highlighting how economic fortunes of similar broad caste groups vary significantly across states and how Other Backward Classes (OBCs) thanks to their large share in population have a significantly large share among the richer sections of the society.

Updated: May 14, 2019 19:38 IST

DMK president MK Stalin on Tuesday rubbished the claims of Tamil Nadu BJP president Tamilisai Soundarrajan who claimed that the Dravidian major was in talks with the saffron party and said he would quit politics if proved otherwise.

“If Tamilisai Soundarrajan or Narendra Modi, whom she wants to become Prime Minister again prove that I am talking to them for an alliance with the BJP, I’m prepared to quit politics. If they fail to prove it, will they renounce politics?” the DMK president challenged in a hard hitting statement to the media.

“It is unfortunate and painful that Tamilisai, hailing from a family with a political legacy, has denigrated herself to this level and allowed to be a scapegoat by the self seeking BJP leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others. This is part of the dirty tricks of the BJP,” the statement read.

“I was the first to endorse Congress President Rahul Gandhi for Prime Ministership and rip apart Modi as a ‘fascist, sadist and autocrat’ throughout the poll campaign to prevent by all means his return to power,” Stalin said.

He suspects this was a ploy by the BJP to prevent the votes of the minorities for the DMK in the crucial bypoll to the four assembly segments on May 19 and to blunt the DMK’s campaign projecting Rahul for PM. “For no reason, they are trying to drag the DMK,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Tamilisai Soundarrajan dropped a bombshell claiming that the DMK was in talks with the BJP.

“The hunger and thirst for office is driving Stalin to reach out to Modi. First, it was Rahul, then KCR and now it is Modi. Everyone knows the DMK changes colours. To each one, he is showing a different colour. They are speaking through someone and are establishing connection,” she said and laughed heartily at the media interaction in Thoothukudi.

“It is true,” she affirmed when asked whether the DMK was in touch with the BJP for a post-poll tie-up. However, she did not elaborate.

“Post-KCR meeting, why Stalin was not firm in endorsing Rahul Gandhi for Prime Ministership?” Soundarrajan asked.

Also read: Did Stalin snub KCR’s Federal Front pitch? Just a ‘courtesy call’, says DMK

She claimed that the BJP would retain power at the Centre on its own and that the saffron party is not worried over the Stalin-KCR meeting. “Emergence of any number of fronts would only benefit the BJP,” she asserted.

Soundarrajan who is the BJP candidate from the southern coastal constituency of Thoothukudi is up against the DMK’s Kanimozhi.

The Congress has dismissed Soundarrajan’s claim as an ‘unadulterated lie’ which is proof of the BJP being rattled at the electoral rout.

“There is not even an iota of truth in Tamilisai’s unfounded claim. The DMK is firmly with the Congress and we have no doubt about it. This betrays the saffron party’s mortal fear of facing the prospect of a rout in the LS poll. Hence, it is attempting to sow the seeds of confusion in the opposition camp. Such dirty tricks would not succeed as Stalin is committed to secularism and pluralism,” TNCC president KS Alagiri told the media.

But the AIADMK latched on to Soundarrajan’s claim to target the DMK. It said there was nothing surprising in the DMK talking to KCR and the saffron party, even while remaining in the alliance with the Congress. AIADMK veteran and Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister Jayakumar led the charge against the DMK on Monday claiming that the Dravidian major was reaching out to the BJP with a bargain for five plum ministerial berths at the Centre. He reiterated it on Tuesday as well.

“Only Stalin is capable of sailing in three boats at the same time. While being in alliance with the Congress, he is hosting Chandrasekhar Rao and holding parleys with the BJP. It has become crystal clear to Stalin that the the election results will be in favour of the AIADMK in the state and the BJP at the Centre. Hence, he is in talks with the BJP to secure five ministerial berths at the Centre,” Jayakumar told the media."

Updated: May 13, 2019 20:29 IST

Union finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday hit back at Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati for her remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mayawati and PM Modi have been involved in a bitter war of words over a gang rape case in Rajasthan’s Alwar.

Arun Jaitley said Mayawati has “stooped to an all-time low” and she was not suitable for public life. “Behan Mayawati - She is firm on becoming a Prime Minister. Her governance, ethics and discourse stoops to an all-time low. Her personal attack today on the Prime Minister exposes her as unfit for public life,” Jaitley tweeted.

Mayawati had launched a scathing personal attack on PM Modi after he accused her of “shedding crocodile tears”.

In an interview to news agency ANI, she accused Modi of playing “dirty politics”. “Narendra Modi was silent on Alwar gang rape case. He’s trying to play dirty politics over it so that his party can benefit in the elections. It is extremely shameful. How can he respect others’ sisters and wives when he has left his own wife for political gains?” news agency ANI quoted Mayawati as saying.

The BSP boss said wives don’t let their husbands go near the PM out of “fear that they may also leave them like Modi left his wife.”

At a poll rally on Sunday, PM Modi had hit out at Mayawati over the rape case and challenged her party to withdraw support from the Congress government in Rajasthan.

Mayawati accused the PM of showing false sympathy for Dalits and said that his words rang hollow. “If Modi had genuinely been a backward caste person, he would not have objected to bungalows owned by Dalit and OBC people. He changes his caste every day for electoral gains,” she added.

There have been protests in Rajasthan over the Alwar rape case after reports of police delay in filing a first information report (FIR). The BJP has accused the Congress government in the state of trying to hush up the matter."

Updated: May 10, 2019 12:05 IST

The family of CRPF jawan Mahesh Kumar, who lost his life in Pulwama terrorist attack on February 14, is yet to come to terms with the irreparable loss that it has suffered.

The family members are not only dissatisfied with the monetary assistance provided to them by the government, they are equally unhappy over the claims which it made about the air strikes in Balakot (Pakistan).

According to the soldier’s kin, leaders should not play politics over the army and instead focus on development.

Tudihar Badal Ka Purwa, a village close to Prayagraj-Mirzapur highway witnessed hectic activity when the soldier’s body was taken there for last rites. Leaders of all the political parties and officials of all ranks queued up to Mahesh’s house for over a week after his last rites were performed. As the days passed by, the number of visitors started dwindling.

Mahesh is survived by his wife Sanju Devi and two sons, Samar (6) and Sahil (5).

Mahesh’s father Raj Kumar said, “We remain busy in the fields as we have many mouths to feed. We are still mourning the loss but are gradually coming to terms with the tragedy. Not only our family but the entire village is proud of Mahesh but we are extremely unhappy over the politics being played over the attack which claimed the lives of security personnel. Polls are being contested in the name of soldiers but not much is being done for their family and children.”

Rajkumar’s other brothers Suresh Kumar and Santlal also joined the conversation.

Rakesh Kumar, the son of Raj Kumar’s elder brother Shiv Kumar, is also in CRPF and the family is ready to send their other children to join the forces.

“We have received the cheque announced by the government but are yet to receive other benefits including the promise of job to my younger son Amresh. I approached the district magistrate who asked me to meet him after elections. The promise of a gate outside the village in the memory of my son also seems to be a far cry. The members of our family still defecate in the open and the promise of construction of a toilet in our house has not been fulfilled yet,” Raj Kumar lamented.

“I was also promised some agricultural land but the lekhpal says no land is available as of now,” he complained.

He said no compensation or government assistance could compensate their loss but the soldiers who lay down their lives for the country should be given due respect.

“Instead of playing politics, leaders should strengthen the country’s security and bring development, employment, infrastructure and education to villages of martyred jawans,” he added.

“While we mourned our soldiers’ deaths, there was not a single photograph to show the bodies of terrorists or their families mourning their death after air strikes in Pakistan,” he added.

Raj Kumar said though the family was not happy with the state of affairs, they would definitely cast vote to bring about a change.

Although too young to understand the loss, Mahesh Kumar’s sons listened to the conversation with curiosity while sitting next to their grandfather.

Speaking about his daughter-in-law, he said: “She often comes to this room where Mahesh’s garlanded photographs are placed. She weeps for hours and is hard to console. She has refused the government’s offer for a job as she does not want to compromise with the upbringing of her two sons.”

Villagers also said development and employment should be the core agenda of all political parties."

This week on Grand Tamasha, Max Rodenbeck and Alex Travelli of the Economist South Asia bureau join Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) to discuss the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The Economist’s recent editorial argues that while BJP Prime Minister Narendra Modi “has been neither as good for India as his cheerleaders foretold, nor as bad as his critics…imagined,” the risks associated with a Modi-led BJP still outweigh the rewards.

Max Rodenbeck and Alex Travelli and Milan discuss the Economist’s editorial line, the nature of the 2019 campaign, and what’s at stake for India. Alex and Max also dispel the notion that coalition government is bad for governance in India.

Then, Milan speaks with Rahul Verma of the University of California-Berkeley and the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. Rahul is the co-author, with Pradeep Chhibber, of a fascinating new book on Indian politics, Ideology and Identity: The Changing Party Systems of India.

Rahul’s new book busts the myth that Indian politics is non-ideological simply because it does not adhere to the traditional left-right spectrum that characterizes Western politics. Milan and Rahul discuss how status politics and the role of the state in social life animate party competition in India and how these two factors are changing over time.

Rahul also weighs in on the cracks that are emerging within the BJP’s core ideological coalition and the risks this fracture poses for the party’s future."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of playing politics over the cyclone Fani issue. PM Modi, who was addressing a poll rally in Bengal’s Tamluk, said he tried to contact the Bengal CM twice, but she didn’t respond.

“Speedbreaker didi has tried to play politics even on cyclone. Tried to talk to her twice but she didn’t talk to me, such is her arrogance. I kept waiting for her to call back,” PM Modi said. He had conducted a survey on cyclone-hit areas in Odisha earlier in the day and praised CM Naveen Patnaik for relief and rescue operations.

Mamata Banerjee later responded to the swipe. The chief minister said she could not take the call because she was away in Kharagpur. “I don’t want to share dais with expiry PM as elections are on,” she told an election rally, according to news agency PTI.

On Sunday, a controversy had erupted with the Bengal administration alleging that the prime minister had bypassed the state chief minister Mamata Banerjee and had called governor Keshari Nath Tripathi asking him to prepare a report on the damage that had been inflicted by Cyclone Fani in the state.

“Attention has been drawn to reports in a section of the media, that the Trinamool Congress has expressed its displeasure at Prime Minister Modi speaking only to West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, about the post-Fani situation in the state.

“Apparently, Trinamool leaders have claimed that the Prime Minister had called up Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, but did not phone West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The above claim is incorrect,” sources said.

Sources said that two attempts had been made on Saturday morning by the prime minister’s staff to connect him to the West Bengal CM on phone.

“The first time, the staff who were attempting to place the call, were told that the West Bengal CM is on tour, and that the call would be returned. On the second occasion too, the staff attempting to place the call were told by the CM’s office, that the call will be returned.”

Alleging that the Prime Minister bypassed the state government, Trinamool secretary general and minister Partha Chatterjee said on Saturday, “This is the biggest example of indecency. In a federal structural a state government has its own position and rights. The Modi government never respected that.”"

“They gave me my bed tea very late today. So I got up late. I really don’t know what has happened there.” The journalists received this reply from Bengali actress Moon Moon Sen when she was asked what caused the electoral violence in her parliamentary constituency, Asansol. That day, there was another surprising scene on TV. This time it was Sunny Deol. As soon as he stepped out of the polling booth after casting his vote, journalists questioned him about his new political avatar. He first folded his hands and then ran towards his car without saying anything. In my experience of 40 years as a journalist, I have seen many good and bad events, but never before have I witnessed such scenes.

Let’s first look at Moon Moon Sen. In 2014, Babul Supriyo was elected from Asansol. He is a Union minister of state and a well-known singer. Perhaps Mamata Banerjee thought that Moon Moon Sen is more popular than Babul Supriyo and so she will definitely be able to defeat him. Sunny Deol has also been given ticket from Gurdaspur solely on this basis. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command may have thought that if Dharmendra in 2009 and Hema Malini in 2014 can win on the basis of sheer glamour from regions they are not directly identified with, then why not Sunny Deol? Moreover, he has replaced Vinod Khanna, so this would be a seamless transition.

It was perhaps on this basis that the actress of yesteryears, Urmila Matondkar, was selected as a candidate. Matondkar has no political experience but now she is a Congress Lok Sabha candidate from North Mumbai.

This practice of film stars joining politics started in south India way back in the 1960s. After about two decades, the trend caught up in the north too. I remember, in the initial phase, actors had to face a lot many problems. In 1984, Amitabh Bachchan was contesting against Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna in Allahabad. At that time, many who considered Allahabad the country’s intellectual capital were quite displeased with the fact that though it was not unconstitutional to field an actor against such a famous and prominent leader, it was certainly improper. Noted poet and Amitabh’s father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, himself had to camp in Allahabad to placate these people.

It is not a coincidence that almost all the political parties have a preference for film stars and sports figures. These parties work and function through their workers. Many senior leaders of various parties have worked relentlessly and selflessly for their parties. Then, it is puzzling that they are neglecting their own party workers.

To what extent can the people who get tickets to contest elections without even being familiar with the party’s principles prove to be the well-wishers of the party? Take, for example, Sapna Choudhary. At first, she was rumoured to have joined the Congress but the very next day she was seen singing the praises of the BJP.

Unfortunately, Indian politics is either driven by dynasties or fairweather entrants. Haven’t we been degenerating step by step in every election because of this?

I am reminded of a scene from the film Anari. In it, Raj Kapoor finds the wallet which belongs to Motilal, who had dropped it. As Raj Kapoor approaches Motilal to return the wallet, some goons attack him. Thrashed and with his clothes torn, he somehow manages to reach the club where Motilal is and returns the wallet. Motilal looks at him with surprise and says something which has always stayed with me. “Young man, all these people you see around here must have got some wallets, which were dropped at one point or another, which they did not return.”

Indian politics is also turning into a club for the elite. Those who came to the corridors of power by struggling in the name of democracy are either too ambitious and later doomed to become like those very people they had protested against. That’s why our democracy has now been reduced to a mere chariot for some families, corporates and the glamour brigade. The voters may nurture the illusion of driving this chariot if they want to, but the fact is what they consider the power to elect is not in their hands at all.

Is this democracy or a mere mirage?

Updated: May 05, 2019 19:57 IST

In a counter-attack, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of leaving behind an economy in slowdown, after Singh’s criticism that the Indian economy is in “dire straits” under PM Modi and also predicted that it is headed for a slowdown.

In a series of tweets, Jaitley pointed out that it was Manmohan Singh who left behind an economy in slowdown in 2014. He further said policy paralysis and corruption were also Manmohan Singh’s gifts to the Modi government. Jaitley also credited the former PM of bringing down the Congress party to its lowest tally in parliament in the last Lok Sabha elections. India was a part of the fragile five during the former PM’s time, Jaitley said in another tweet.

“When an Economist turns into a politician, he looses sense of both economy and politics,” tweeted Jaitley.

The comments came after Manmohan Singh, in an interview to PTI, found fault with PM Modi’s five-year rule, describing it as “most traumatic and devastating”. Singh, known as the architect of India’s economic reforms in 1990s, felt the country is headed for a slowdown and accused the Modi regime of leaving the country’s economy in “dire straits”.

In one of his most fierce attacks on the Modi dispensation, Singh alleged that the past five years only witnessed “stench” of corruption peaking to “unimaginable proportions”, adding demonetisation was perhaps the “biggest scam” of independent India.

Singh dismissed the notion that there was a wave in favour of Modi and asserted that the people have made up their minds to vote out the government that “does not believe in inclusive growth and is only worried about its political existence at the altar of disharmony”."

Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav named actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha’s wife Poonam Sinha as his party’s Lucknow candidate against union home minister Rajnath Singh, the sitting BJP MP. Pankaj Jaiswal spoke to Poonam Sinha on a day of hectic campaigning. Excerpts from the interview:

You once participated in a beauty contest (Miss Young India) and won. Now, you are in a contest of a different kind. What are the possibilities of victory here? How are the two contests different or similar?

Maybe the lucky streak is happening again--in continuity. Well, the beauty pageant is a very old story now. It was way back in the 1960s. This (election) is something very new. At this point in my life, I want to do something very constructive for the country.

You just said this is new to you, but you have also been saying that politics is not new to you.

I have been connected to politics, but not directly. Shatrughanji has been in politics for a long time. He had fought polls, got elected to Parliament, been a minister and is contesting again. But so far, my participation had been indirect. Now, it is direct participation as I am contesting.

Is Lucknow new or you have some connection with the city?

We do have a connection with Lucknow. During the Partition, a lot of people from Karachi and Hyderabad (Sindh) in Pakistan came to Lucknow, including our relatives. They first came here and then moved to Mumbai. Of course, we have a lot of relatives and friends here. So there is a little connection with Lucknow.

Did the Lucknow candidature happen all of a sudden?

No, it did not happen all of a sudden. It was in the offing. Talks were on since December. Akhileshji asked me to contest, it was a very nice and generous offer from him. We have known Akhilesh for very long. I thought it’s the right time for me to enter (politics).

Since when are you in Lucknow and for how long will you stay? What if you lose?

I will win. I will stay in politics and here, be it a victory or loss. I will work in politics. If Akhileshji thinks that I am worth some work and assigns me (a task), I will work. So far as the other people before me, people lose interest once they lose the plot. They tend to go back to their families, life. I will stay to work in politics. Three phases have gone. The picture is becoming clearer in favour of the gathbandhan. People ask me to roll down my car window to say, “We want you here because we want to get rid of Modi, Yogi.”

You have been assigned a seat where victory for you looks like an uphill task going by the constituency’s history? How do you see this?

People want a change. Wherever I go, I have seen people fed up with the BJP, Modi, Yogi. Akhileshji has done such phenomenal work here. Rajnath Singh might be a tall leader, and the BJP continued to win the seat, but at the same time, they did not do any tall (great) work unlike Akhileshji here. He has done wonders for the state and the city. People worship him. Look at the Metro, Janeshwar Mishra Park, and so many other projects.

Why Shatrughan Sinha and you, are not in the same party?

He had joined the Congress before I joined the SP. He was very clear that he has to contest from his Patna Sahib seat again, no matter what happens. The SP is not there.

You had campaigned for Shatrughan Sinha before? Will both of your campaign for each other now?

Now, it looks difficult. The dates are clashing, he is busy there. I am busy here. Kush (our son) is with me here, Lav (the twin sibling) is with him in Patna.

Your connection with films is over or will it continue?

The last film that I did was Jodha Akbar. I did the film because I thought it is a good film and would be very different for me to work. Working with Ashutosh Gowarikar was attractive. Now, no more films. I will stay focused on my work, politics.

Would your Bollywood star daughter Sonakshi Sinha campaign for you?

Hopefully. We are trying to work it out. She has started shooting for Dabangg 3 now."

Gautam Gambhir, the BJP’s candidate for the East Delhi Lok Sabha seat, on Sunday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of negative politics after his rival Atishi accused him of holding two voter identity cards.

“When you don’t have a vision and have done nothing in the last 4.5 years, you make such allegations, the EC will decide this. When you have a vision you don’t do such negative politics.” ANI quoted Gambhir as saying.

Atishi had lodged a criminal complaint against the former cricket star for allegedly holding two voter ID cards - one from Karol Bagh and another from Rajinder Nagar. She moved a Delhi court to investigate the matter. The court has listed the matter for May 1.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had earlier described AAP’s complaint against Gambhir as a conspiracy.

Watch: ‘AAP doing negative politics’, says Gautam over Atishi’s voter ID remark

Gambhir also found himself in the Election Commission’s line of fire which pulled him up on Saturday for “holding a political rally without taking permission”. He had held a massive roadshow in Delhi on Tuesday ahead of filing his nomination from East Delhi.

The cricketer-turned-politician joined the BJP on March 22."

Suresh Koth, 50, has entered electoral politics after remaining active in farmer agitations, including the Jat reservation stir, for years.

Koth is the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) candidate from Lok Sabha seat of Hisar.

He is pitted against Dushyant Chautala of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), which is contesting the polls in alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP); Congress candidate Bhavya Bishnoi, son of senior party leader Kuldeep Bishnoi; and BJP nominee Brijendra Singh, former bureaucrat and son of Union steel minister Birender Singh. Koth had actively participated in the quota agitation right from the time it was launched in Haryana in 2010. He is facing many criminal cases for blocking national highways, rioting and unlawful assembly at various police stations of Hisar.

All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) state spokesperson Rambhagat Malik said Koth shared stage with senior Jat leaders during 2010 protests for reservation for the community.

Koth, a resident of Koth Kalan village, completed his BA degree from Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi, in 2018.

Claiming that he is a common man, Koth says, “INLD is the only party that has given tickets to common people. It’s only the people like us who actually know the issues of the common man.”

He added, “Being a farmer leader, I know the problems and issues of the peasantry and how to get these resolved.”

Koth said he has already started his election campaign and is getting support from all sections of society.Asked about his contest with heavyweights of other parties, he said, “Heavyweight leaders from other parties will come here to seek votes and they will not show their face again for five years. However, I am going to stay here forever.”"

Milind Deora, contesting from Mumbai South as Congress candidate and challenging incumbent MP Arvind Sawant (Shiv Sena-BJP), released a video last week as part of his election campaign. The video has since travelled far and wide, and raised a number of questions. The brouhaha over it says something about the dichotomy in the business-politics relationship.

In the video, Mukesh Ambani and Uday Kotak are among those who endorse Deora to represent the constituency. Ambani says to the camera, “Milind is the man for South Bombay. Having represented South Bombay for 10 years, I believe Milind has in-depth knowledge of the social, economic and cultural ecosystem of the constituency”. This must be the first such public endorsement by the nation’s most wealthy and powerful industrialist. It is certainly a departure from the past in which industrialists were shy to proclaim their political preferences.

Commentators saw in it the portents of changes, the shifting of political winds as it were, against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If only a change of government and party in power were as simple as a video endorsement, politicians would not be juggling electoral arithmetic and there wouldn’t be a booming electoral economy. The 2019 general election will cost an unprecedented ₹50,000 crore or $7 billion, according to New Delhi-based Centre for Media Studies. That business and industry share a symbiotic relationship with politics is an open secret. For a number of historical reasons, both sides were content to keep it away from public glare. In a nation with deep poverty till recently, politicians aligned themselves with their majority voters but they simultaneously conducted the business of politics behind closed doors. The 1991 economic liberalisation and subsequent impacts have allowed this relationship to be aired. Ambani’s and Kotak’s endorsement should be seen in this light but that’s part of the story. The other part is in the relationship between India’s wealthiest and its political class. Ambani, as Raj Thackeray told a Mumbai audience this week, is a powerful businessman and knows which direction the wind is blowing. Ambani is India’s richest and the world’s 13th richest man with a net worth of more than $50 billion, according to Forbes this year. He is unlikely to put all his weight behind one political party or a candidate. The family is known to keep warm relations across the political spectrum. The dissonance comes from Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s repeated references to Prime Minister Modi’s government as “suit-boot ki sarkar” and Gandhi’s decision to keep industrialists at arm’s length. But the Congress party, especially Deora, is a realist. That’s why he had Ambani endorse him; it could help swing a close election. Besides, Deora’s family through his late father Murli Deora and the Ambanis go back a long way in the business-politics relationship, and are also part of south Mumbai’s swish set where business and politics seamlessly merge.

The video is the tip of the berg. What should concern us is how big businesses have managed to game the political system and how industrialists wear both hats at the same time. The book “India’s Porous State: Blurred Boundaries and the Evolving Business-State Relationship in India” by Christophe Jaffrelot, Atul Kohli, and Kanta Murali, identified three ways in which business plays a role in India’s politics.

It states, first, with business leaders as MPs, the representative power of business in the institution increases. According to the book, second, it enables business to make policy and influence how policies are implemented. Third, many of these business leader-MPs sit on parliamentary committees which have jurisdiction over their businesses thereby creating conflicts of interests. They cite dozens of examples including that of Vijay Mallya who sat on three Parliamentary Committees when he had business interests in all three sectors. From barely 14% in 1991, businessmen and industrialists formed 26% of the Lok Sabha, the book stated. Now that is cause for reflection."

Updated: Apr 25, 2019 09:03 IST

After the 2012 murder and gang rape case, many political parties began talking about the issue of women’s safety. While there was some engagement with the issue in 2014, the run up to the 2019 elections has seen a total disengagement with any gender issues regarding safety or rights. It cannot be stressed enough that policies that deal with ending violence against women must be multi-pronged and must involve a wide range of stakeholders.

Improving response to violence

First, the work of addressing violence and crime is a law and order issue. There needs to be better policing and a robust legal system in all respects. From the moment an incident of violence takes place, there must be quick, efficient and non-judgmental responses.

The case must be followed up and dealt with swiftly and properly by the legal system so that perpetrators of violence have a fear of the repercussions of their actions. Much of the Nirbhaya funds have been allocated to CCTV cameras and other technology-based solutions, but not towards improving basic processes. Data shows that while reporting of crimes against women has gone up, the conviction rate is only around 20%.

Further, the promise to set up one-stop crisis centres around the country still needs to be fulfilled. Till now, some 170 centres have become operational.

Haryana has set up seven, including one in Gurugram. Unfortunately, the functioning and efficiency of these centres is often sub-standard in terms of infrastructure and systems. These centres are essential to improve the response to violence.

Gender-sensitive infrastructure

In addition, public infrastructure needs to be addressed. We need to have better planning, service delivery and governance in order to ensure that our cities and towns are designed in ways that ensure accessibility, safety and inclusion.

Safety audits done across cities have shown that urban planning and infrastructure can play a role in making spaces safer.

Thus, we need better lighting and streets, well-maintained sidewalks and other infrastructure.

In addition to infrastructure, our cities and towns need to be planned in ways that ensure that the streets can be used by a wide variety of people, including women, children and specially-abled, among others.

Public toilets are severely lacking in our cities and the ones that exist are often in bad condition and are barely usable. A recent report found that there are 127 public toilets in Gurugram, but 60% of them do not have regular water supply and 60 were found to be kept under lock and key.

Barriers to women’s participation

With only 11% participation, the number of women in politics is also dismally low in our country. While some political parties have increased the number of women candidates, the overall count is still low. In Haryana, there are only six women candidates against 44 male candidates in the fray.

Sexual harassment at the workplace is a major barrier that women face in all arenas of work.

Public discourse around women even during this election has been disturbing. What is somewhat heartening are the cases that have been brought to light in the past year, even against powerful men, but we are still waiting to see the delivery of justice.

Creating a safer and more caring community for girls and women requires a change in our social norms and the way people think. For this, we need to address the education system and popular culture to ensure new ways of thinking so equality is fostered as a value.

We need political commitment to bring about sustainable change. The discourse of protection needs to be changed to a discourse of rights. Safety is a right that all women and girls in this country are entitled to.

Updated: Apr 23, 2019 03:34 IST

In the world’s largest democracy, dynastic politics is a dominant theme, and the Jatland is no exception.

Political parties have once again lined up members of prominent political clans of Haryana for the May 12 Lok Sabha polls.

Leading the pack is the Congress, followed by the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and its off-shoot the newly floated Jannayak Janata Party (JJP).

Haryana has 10 Lok Sabha seats and six Congress candidates hail from different political clans.

Interestingly, the politics of patronage has not left untouched even the BJP — the party that used to hold ‘clout of clan’ responsible for decay in the political culture of Haryana.

Poll observers say the BJP’s decision to field Union minister Birender Singh’s son Brijendra Singh, an IAS officer from Hisar, has come as a surprise. The minister, whose wife Prem Lata is BJP MLA, has offered to resign from the Union cabinet and the Rajya Sabha.

The family traces its lineage to social reformer Sir Chhotu Ram, who was the maternal grandfather of Birender.

Also testing their political muscle will be the third and fourth generations of Haryana’s three famous Lals--Bansi Lal, Devi Lal and Bhajan Lal."

Updated: Apr 18, 2019 00:39 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the only “vision” of the Congress was to create divisions in communities, while Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused him of dividing the nation, sending the political mercury soaring a day before the second phase of the Lok Sabha elections.

In Maharashtra, the Prime Minister alleged that Gandhi described the people from backward classes as “thieves”, in an apparent reference to the Congress chief’s remarks that linked Modi’s surname with wrongdoers.

In Kerala’s Wayanad, the second seat Gandhi is contesting alongside the traditional Congress stronghold of Amethi, the opposition leader said all that the PM did was “tell lies and steal from the poor people”.

The war of words came hours ahead of voting in 95 seats across 11 states and the Union Territory of Puducherry.

“The Congress and its allies say that all Modis in the society are thieves. The Congress and its allies have not kept any shortcomings in abusing of my backward caste. This time they have crossed the limits and abused the entire backward society,” Modi said in Maharashtra’s Madha.

At a recent rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi questioned the Prime Minister’s clean image.

“I have a question. Why all thieves have Modi in their names — be it [fugitive businessman] Nirav Modi, [former cricket administrator] Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi? We don’t know how many more such Modis will come out,” he said.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said Modi was raising emotive issues such as caste since there was no development issue left to talk about. On Twitter, he also accused Modi’s government of creating a divide in the society on the basis of caste and community.

In his home state of Gujarat, Modi, who is from the OBC community, said the Congress operated in an ecosystem that worked on spreading “lies” against him and his government — first when he was the Gujarat chief minister and then when he moved to Delhi as the PM in 2014.

Modi also alleged that the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre tried to hurt Gujarat and falsely implicated Amit Shah, now the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Shah was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2010 in connection with the alleged encounter killing of Sohrabuddin Shaikh, a suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, his wife Kausar Bi and aide Tulsiram Prajapati. He was discharged from the case in 2014.

In 2018, all 22 accused in the case were acquitted by a CBI court in Mumbai due to lack of evidence.

Modi also talked about the Balakot air strike targeting a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp deep inside Pakistan, an action that was India’s response to the February 14 suicide bombing of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama. JeM claimed the attack that killed at least 40 security personnel.

“[They] killed our soldiers in Uri. Should Modi remain silent? Does it make him comfortable? I am raised by Gujarat soil...this is the land of Sardar Saheb [former home minister Vallabhbhai Patel]... Our soldiers destroyed them [terrorists], but it troubled the Congress,” he said, renewing his attack on the Opposition that has asked for the proof of casualties in the February 26 air strike.

In Saurashtra’s Surendranagar, Modi said exporting terrorism was the only objective of “one of our neighbours [Pakistan].”

“Earlier, India used to cry foul in front of the world... But now Pakistan will cry. Didn’t our soldiers attack them inside their homes? You tell me, should we break into the houses and beat them or should sit idle?” he asked.

Modi also said he was not afraid of Pakistan’s nuclear threats. “Earlier, terrorists from Pakistan would come here and go back after conducting an attack. Pakistan would threaten us, saying it has the nuclear bomb and will press the button [if India retaliated],” Modi said. “...I decided to tell them, do whatever you want to do [but we will retaliate].”

Gandhi, who addressed three election rallies in his Wayanad, said the BJP was arrogant and believed that they can re-define Indian history. “Only the Indian people can define, decide about the country. It does not matter that Uttar Pradesh is much bigger than Nagaland. The voice of all Indians matters.”

Taking a jibe at Modi, Gandhi said he was not in Kerala to tell his “Mann Ki Baat”, a reference to a radio programme addressed by the PM. “I am not like the Prime Minister. I am not going to make false promises and tell you I will give you two crore jobs or ~15 lakh in bank accounts or that I will give farmers whatever they want... I am not going to lie to you. Because I respect your intelligence, your wisdom,” Gandhi said.

“I just don’t want to have a relationship for just a few months. I want a lifelong relationship with you. I want the sisters of Wayanad to say that I am like their brother, fathers and mothers to say that I am their son,” Gandhi said.

Kerala BJP leader S Suresh said,” Rahul is so desperate that he is making wild allegations.”

Women in Indian politics face a double disadvantage. The first is the difficulty in getting a foot in through the door in a male-dominated arena. Women account for only 12.15% of the outgoing 16th Lok Sabha. The second is facing unacceptable sexist remarks from male colleagues. The latest to face this is Jaya Prada, formerly of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and now a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). SP leader Azam Khan, in an attempt to highlight her new affiliation, referred to her innerwear being khaki, the colour of the RSS uniform.

This is the kind of raw deal that women of calibre, regardless of their political affiliation, are offered in Indian politics. Smriti Irani, despite her achievements, has often been dismissed as a mere television actress. Sharad Yadav felt it was important to discuss former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s weight. Lalu Prasad spoke of how he would make Bihar’s roads as smooth as Hema Malini’s cheeks. From being described as akin to a sex worker to her gender being questioned, four-time Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mayawati, has been at the receiving end of a staggering amount of vitriol. Politics needs a quantum increase in women to be genuinely representative. But the viciousness faced by women, who have held their own in what is a highly competitive world, is bound to deter other women who might want to consider politics as a career.

Politics need not have so much to do with gender. A person’s ability to take up a relevant issue and being able to work for the well being of constituents should be the only criteria. After all, men are not judged on their looks or their weight. This lack of respect towards women demonstrates that many male politicians are simply unable to accept women as their equals. It is equally shameful that audiences lap up such insults to women politicians. Witness the laughter when BJP leader, Kailash Vijayvargiya, spoke of Priyanka Gandhi having a “chocolatey” face. When people speak of how India has a woman defence minister and foreign minister, they seem to forget that these women have got there through sheer merit and against all odds. As in certain other professions, that is what should count in politics. To demean women politicians on issues that are irrelevant to the political discourse is repugnant. It is as much an assault on women as it is on our politics."

There is a certain logic to representative democracy. Candidates and political parties present their programmes and vision to their constituents; they build wide social coalitions; voters have their say and elect a representative; the leader then becomes a leader of the entire constituency, those who voted for him and those who did not, and keeps his doors open, delivers services, articulates and channels their grievances, and delivers to all without any sense of discrimination.

Maneka Gandhi, Union minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) candidate from the Sultanpur Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh (UP), addressed a Muslim gathering and made a set of statements which overturns this idea behind representative democracy entirely. She indicated to the community she would win the seat, with or without their votes; if she won without their votes, she would get to know through studying the voting pattern in their booth; and if they had not voted for her, but came to her to get work done, they should not expect much for she is not large hearted enough to do so for people who did not support her.

First, while one could treat Ms Gandhi’s claims of victory before the voting as bluster that all candidates typically engage in, she used this rhetoric of triumphalism to almost blackmail the Muslims in the gathering to vote for her. Voters are free agents and can choose who they wish to vote for, without fear. Two, the fact that this happened in a Muslim gathering is no coincidence. The BJP’s politics of exclusion has meant that Muslims do not, largely, vote for the party; in this election in UP, the community is expected to widely support the Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party alliance. Ms Gandhi’s statement is addressed to Muslims at large -- and almost amounts to political intimidation. And three, Ms Gandhi, despite being an experienced Member of Parliament, lacks a sense of what leadership means. Whether a constituent voted for her or not is irrelevant to her duties as a representative of that constituency. Her statements are out of line, and deserve the widest condemnation."

The two also discuss the tensions between the Congress and Left parties in light of Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest elections from Wayanad in Kerala and the general travails of Left politics in India today.

Then, Milan speaks with Congress Member of Parliament Dr. Shashi Tharoor, who took a short break from hectic campaigning in his constituency of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala to join the show.

Milan speaks with Tharoor about the Congress’ vision for 2019, the top concerns of voters in his constituency, and why the party has devoted so much energy to the issue of the controversy surrounding the Rafale fighter jet deal.

Milan also asks Tharoor about the future of secularism and why Tharoor has written about the need to reclaim Hinduism from Hindutva."

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Friday attacked the BJP, accusing it of orchestrating divisive politics across India. Kejriwal was addressing a public gathering at a slum cluster in Okhla, which falls in the East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.

“In 2014, you voted for Modiji. What has his party done? Pitched Jats against non-Jats in Haryana, Hindus against Muslims in UP and across India? As long as the Modi-Shah [referring to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah] duo rule the country, things are not going to change,” said Kejriwal, also the AAP national convener.

So far, AAP is the only party to have announced their candidates for all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. The party launched its campaign on March 23, with the primary poll plank being full statehood for Delhi.

Delhi goes to polls on May 12.

“On May 12, do not vote for a PM, vote for full statehood for Delhi, which will bring something for your children and the generations ahead,” he said.

Without elaborating much, he also attacked Congress. “If you think there is any point making Rahul Gandhi the PM, forget that,” he said.

Kejriwal pitched for full statehood for Delhi by mentioning the AAP government’s tussle with the BJP-led Centre and saying how that could be tackled with full statehood. He said statehood would mean better infrastructure, jobs, education, health care, law and order, housing, relief from SC-monitored sealing drive and 85% reservation for voters in government jobs and colleges.

He said both the BJP and the Congress have betrayed the people of Delhi on the matter of full statehood by mentioning it in their previous manifestoes but not doing anything. “You give us all seats, we will snatch full statehood in two years,” he said.

AAP’s Delhi convener Gopal Rai had earlier said they would take advantage of the Grand alliance of the Opposition for the purpose. AAP has support from regional parties too, he had said.

Delhi BJP spokesperson, Praveen Shankar Kapoor, said, “It is Kejriwal who plays politics of religion, caste and regionalism. He should be the last person to talk about divisive politics.”

Delhi Congress spokesperson, Jitendra Kochar, said, “Kejriwal can have his own opinions on Rahul Gandhi. But he must remember people of India have voted Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi to power. If they see a leader in Rahul Gandhi, they won’t seek Kejriwal’s opinion.”"

Updated: Mar 28, 2019 20:16 IST

As the March 29 deadline for submission of comments and feedback on the government’s new e-commerce policy is upon us, we must review the policy’s flaws. Released only last month by the department of industrial policy & promotion (DIPP), the policy reads more as politics than a blueprint for the Digital India.

Its overt nationalism can best be described as: “Indian people’s data is for mining only by big Indian companies, helping the government watch over everyone better.” Naturally, this will not wear well when the current heightened nationalistic fervour has receded. The policy is an example of how not to approach the idea of Digital India.

The e-commerce policy assumes that recording granular details of users’ online behaviour and monetising this data as a “national resource” for local economic exploitation is a tolerable social future, perhaps even the best. It goes on to say that the data of and about Indians is their property, but it also decrees that Indians are not allowed to store this data abroad, or to contract with others to do that on their behalf — except under draconian conditions, which include an absolute ban on the further transfer of that data from its foreign location.

In other words, this property is not fully convertible by the very individuals who purportedly own it. The policy treats the aggregated data of Indians as the aggregate property of India, which is a clever euphemism for Indian businesses. And these businesses can monetise this data preferentially, including selling its value abroad without limitation — so long as they store the data in India.

The “data localisation” imperative of this policy is a classic non-tariff barrier to the multinational “platform companies”. Requiring “data about Indians” to be stored and transacted for only in India, the policy favours Indian industry. But like most non-tariff barriers, its supposed object — keeping the foreign business out — is only incidentally harmed: under the garb of protection, the real cost falls on the consumers and small businesses.

Rules that require data localisation are in fact detrimental to the efforts of small and medium e-commerce companies in India. The country’s unreliable electricity supply prevents all but a few small and medium businesses from running their own servers, which could help keep their data in their own till. The most cost-effective alternative for them is to buy services in the global “cloud,” where, for a small monthly cost, they can have their services hosted and their data stored.

India’s proposed policy prohibits that approach, depriving all but the largest Indian businesses from succeeding in the e-commerce revolution. Every digital transaction will have to go through them, and we can all see perfectly well who they are.

It’s unrealistic to assume that India can build a local storage industry to employ people whose livelihoods in small and medium e-commerce ventures the policy threatens. Data centres are extremely efficient at converting electricity into profit but that’s because they hardly require workers. Producing and delivering, with perfect reliability, hundreds of kilowatt hours in order to create a few dozen jobs will never be economically feasible in India.

From its fundamentals to its details, the essence of this policy is to fight digital colonialism by putting local digital oligarchs in charge, securing to them both the profits of the domestic market and special benefits in exporting post-colonial digital products made from Indians. (The policy is explicit on the detail of forcing all incoming physical goods bought electronically through the “customs channel,” thus ensuring politics gets its cut.)

This regressive, anti-global approach is joined to the fundamental assumption that Digital India should be based on monetising citizens’ intimate life at home and in the market. Digital India can’t be a data mine in which we turn billions of human lives into raw material for a “fourth industrial revolution” whose destruction of human privacy will rival the destruction of our air, water, and climate by the previous revolution. Digital India must be an exporter of services based around the recognition of privacy, dignity, democracy and freedom. We are as ideally based to sell privacy-respecting services on the internet to all societies for cash as Silicon Valley is to sell privacy-disrespecting “free” services over the same internet.

The right e-commerce policy for India would emphasise the leveraging of the global internet to enable Indian businesses, generate employment, and ensure privacy and dignity. Instead of replaying the worst of the past, it is our triumph over digital colonialism that will really contribute to national greatness.

Updated: Mar 21, 2019 00:25 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked voters on Wednesday to remember the past and how “one family’s” desire for power cost the nation greatly. Seeking a second term in Prime Minister’s office, Modi wrote in a blog that institutional insult was the Congress’s way.

“From the press to parliament. From soldiers to free speech. From the constitution to the courts. Institutional insult is the Congress way,” Modi wrote. “Everyone is wrong, only the Congress is correct.”

“If they could do then, they can surely do now,” Modi said, writing about issues such as emergency under former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and the tussle between the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the previous United Progressive Alliance government over its reports on the telecom scam and irregularities in coal block allocation.

Modi said the Congress did not believe in internal democracy. “The sense of entitlement can be seen in their conduct towards routine legal processes... their top leadership is out on bail. When the authorities seek to question them on their dealings, they do not even bother to reply.”

When a Government works with the spirit of “India First” instead of “Family First”, Modi said, it shows in its working. “India has seen that whenever dynastic politics has been powerful, institutions have taken a severe beating,” he said.

Reacting strongly to the Modi’s tweet on dynasty politics, Congress general secretary and eastern UP incharge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “The Prime Minister should stop thinking that people are fools and understand that they see through all this.”"

Updated: Mar 20, 2019 13:19 IST

Is it just me or do you also feel that gurus are suddenly taking a much greater interest in party politics than ever before?

When I was starting out as a reporter I was frequently put on the guru beat. I went to the Hare Krishna complex when it was being constructed in the Mumbai suburb of Juhu and listened politely as various ‘monks’ told me about how the complex would be a ‘spiritual Disneyland’. (But where’s the mouse, I felt like asking).

The Hare Krishnas were okay, actually. They had no real interest in Indian politics and were only concerned that their contribution to the propagation of Indian culture in the West should be properly acknowledged. (Which I duly did. My piece began “The Hare Krishna movement’s greatest contribution to the propagation of Indian culture abroad is that millions of Americans now think that the Hindu religion has three gods: Rama, Krishna and Harry.” They did not see the joke).

I also went to Ganeshpuri while I was on the guru beat and met Swami Muktananda who, I have to say, I quite liked. He must have included politicians among his many devotees but he gave no indication of being partial to any one side. His discourses were studiously non-political.

I never quite got to meet Sathya Sai Baba who certainly had followers in every political party but once again I always got the impression that old boy regarded himself as being above politics. Likewise for the next generation of gurus. Gurumayi who followed Muktananda stayed out of politics as did the Sai Baba operation as a whole after the Baba himself passed.

I spent time at the Rajneesh ashram in Poona in the days when the old humbug was still meeting people (and no, all you viewers of Wild Wild Country, Ma Anand Sheela was not around --- she joined him later ---- and the operation was run by another Gujarati lady whose name I regret to say I have forgotten) and though Rajneesh seemed to hate all politicians even he, charismatic old charlatan that he was, would not pit one party against the other.

I have been racking my brains to think of gurus and godmen from the old days who involved themselves in party politics. I don’t suppose Dhirendra Brahmachari counts; he was a dodgy character who hung around Indira Gandhi but was no guru or godman. There was a Ma Anandmayi who Indira Gandhi was close to but their bond seemed to exclude politics.

You could contrast this with Muslim holy men, many of whom did not hesitate to take sides, not just during elections but also at times of international crisis. The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, for instance, took credit for having Indira Gandhi defeated in 1977 and then went on to become a full fledged political Imam. During the US invasion of Afghanistan (after 9/11) he attacked America during his preachings and spoke of the need for Indian Muslims to stand firmly with the Taliban. (One notable Indian Muslim, Javed Akhtar, commented at the time that as the Imam was so keen to help the Taliban, the government of the day had a moral duty to put him in a plane, fly him over Afghanistan and airdrop him there).

The Muslim clergy may remain as politically aware as before with religious leaders happy to issue political fatwas. Some the Hindu Shankaracharyas are also quite willing to lend tacit support to political parties.

But the interesting thing is that the generation of gurus and godmen who have followed Muktanand and Sai Baba are now ready to openly put their weight behind politicians, parties and candidates for office.

I first noticed it when Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the yoga master who I had admired for the work he was doing teaching breathing techniques to his disciples, came out in support of Narendra Modi when the UPA was still in power.

The swami’s sudden love for Modi had been obviously been accompanied by a correspondence course in economics because Sri Sri took it upon himself to tell us what the rupee-dollar rate would be if Modi came to office. (I think he thought the dollar would be Rs 40 when Modi ascended to the job --- in actual fact the rate is now nearer Rs 68 to the dollar. You just can’t depend on correspondence courses these days!)

Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has made it clear that he wants to be involved in matters of politics. He began to involve himself in the Ayodhya issue and has now been appointed by the Supreme Court as a mediator in the dispute. (Frankly this is quite unfair to Yogi Adityanath who is at least as neutral as the Double-Sri and could well have become a mediator himself.)

Then there is the phenomenon of Baba Ramdev. I have no idea how good the Baba’s products are but who can deny that a) he has turned himself into a TV Star, b) he has become a billionaire, challenging and defeating consumer-focussed multinationals at their own game and c) that his yogic skills are impressive.

Does all this mean that he too must seek a role in political affairs? Indeed it does. When he came to Delhi in the UPA era to stage a political protest, ministers rushed to the airport to beg him to desist. When Ramdev went ahead anyway, the government was worried enough to send the police in to violently disband Ramdev’s gathering. The Baba himself only escaped thanks to some creative cross-dressing. Now, he is a major national figure who, many believe, will join politics one day.

Or take Jaggi Vasudev, a man who has never met a television camera he did not immediately fall in love with. Jaggi has done everything possible to remain in the public eye, pandering to socialites, asking the likes of Karan Johar and Shekhar Kapur to interview him and even turning up on a Gordon Ramsay cooking show on a motorcycle. There is very little this man will not do in his endeavour to keep himself in the public eye.

Which is fine. The world is full of wannabes. But it turns out that even Jaggi Vasudev wants us to know that he has political views. He too wants to be a bargain basement Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

Oh dear. Where will this end?

I’m not sure. I think the phenomenon of the guru as political activist is now well-established. Some of these guys will get somewhere. Others will remain stuck on motorbikes on cookery shows.

Either way, it marks a huge shift from the way in which their predecessors carried themselves. Many of the older gurus were humbugs and charlatans but they knew where their ambitions ended.

In today’s India however, with mass media available to gurus and with the ruling establishment eager to take them aboard as symbols of a new Hindu India, the gurus see no reason to stop.

I am guessing that Ramdev will take the plunge into active politics over the next few years. And one of the other gurus will probably lobby to become the next President of India.

Don’t laugh. Just wait and see.

Updated: Mar 19, 2019 16:51 IST

A short-video app made for mobile phones, and launched in 2016, is providing some zing in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, widely hyped as India’s first social media election.

The app is TikTok, and its virtually inexhaustible library of prompts, and easy editing tools, using which people can create their own short videos, has resulted in a veritable deluge of political memes or just political videos. People can lip-sync to some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches, make a meme featuring Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s “Chowkidar Chor Hai” (the watchman is a thief) barb aimed at Modi, or just riff off Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s dismissive “Toh kar na” (then, why don’t you do it; a remark aimed at the Opposition in the Delhi assembly).

In January, there were 60 million active Indian users who together spent 12.8 billion minutes on it, as per data by Comscore, a mobile analytics firm. That’s almost 3.5 hours a month per user. With the average length of the most popular TikTok videos being 15-20 seconds, that’s a lot of videos (630-840 actually).

As per Sensor Tower, another analytics firm, the app has been downloaded close to 260 million times in India. Analysts aren’t sure that number will stay high, but based on these numbers, it’s safe to say that TikTok is definitely the flavour of the season — and that fact isn’t lost on political parties, even if some of them aren’t fully convinced about it.

The Congress social media cell’s chief, Divya Spandana, says TikTok is less political compared to other platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, but adds that it is entertainment combined with shock value, making it an unusual platform for people who use Twitter and Facebook regularly.

“TikTok has a lot of young users, including first-time voters who are the ones to be targeted. We do have a lot of our volunteers who use the app. I have seen videos of some of Rahul Gandhi’s one-liners like ‘chowkidaar chor hai’ on TikTok,” she said.

The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) social media strategist, Ankit Lal, echoes Spandana and adds that TikTok has brought humour and fun back on the Internet. “While the party [AAP] does not have any organised presence on the platform, individual volunteers use the platform to share quirky messages regularly,” he said

“It [TikTok] is definitely more enjoyable. The number of people abusing you is fewer. The platform gives you an opportunity to express and share your message in a concise manner and make it funny at the same time.”

BJP’s information technology cell chief, Amit Malviya, told news agency Reuters on February 17 that his party was tracking TikTok and called the app “a brilliant medium for creative expression”. He did not respond to multiple calls and text messages for comment.

To be sure, no political party has an official presence on TikTok (ensuring plausible deniability if the humour doesn’t work). All political content on the app is primarily volunteer driven, according to the parties.

TikTok said it does not have any plans of proactively getting politicians and political parties on board (political ads are a key part of Twitter and Facebook’s revenue stream), but it is open for anyone to join and express views and showcase talent as long as it is in line with its community guidelines. “...TikTok has received an overwhelming response in India. The number of users has grown rapidly and TikTok was even crowned as one of India’s most entertaining apps, according to Google Play Awards 2018,” TikTok said in an emailed statement.

Facebook has approximately 300 million, WhatsApp over 230 million and Twitter close to 30 million users in India. But unlike any of them, TikTok, owned by Chinese company Beijing ByteDance Technology Co, capitalises on short term creative content that other platforms do not encourage.

Politics isn’t the biggest thing on TikTok; entertainment is, followed by random slice-of-life videos that people hope will go viral (some do), but in recent months, many political speeches and slogans have been used to create humorous and funny political videos on the app.

To offer one example, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s speech in the Delhi assembly where he said “Toh kar na” in October 2017 has been spoofed across multiple videos on TikTok.

And, to offer another, a 20-second video clip in which Congress president Rahul Gandhi said he knows of a machine that “if fed potato, will give gold in return”, which went viral on social media, in the run-up to the Gujarat assembly elections held in December 2017 has also become fodder for multiple spoof videos on TikTok.

Social media strategists of political parties say they are asking volunteers to engage with and use the app, apart from reaching out to influencers who have already made a name (and have a following).

“Anything that has short snappy video content and is easily shareable will work this election season. TikTok has all of those features,” said Rahul Matthan, a tech policy expert. “TikTok is a popular app just like a bunch of other social apps and political parties recognise that. At this point, political parties want to get into YouTube and Twitter, and increasingly they cannot ignore TikTok either. Its the right platform when you’re targeting first time voters because it has a relatively young user base. Smart political parties will try and understand who their target users are and will focus their social media activities on the platforms that they use.”

Kailas Karthikeyan, a New Delhi-based technology policy consultant, said TikTok’s intense focus on being an easy to use short video product has made it popular among the rural population.

“Its artificial intelligence curation engine, combined with data sets that come from diverse and large sets of users, have enabled it to create compelling individualised experiences that users want to keep coming back to,” he said.

”Parties who want to use the platform before the general elections would have to try and disseminate content organically. I would think the AI engine would treat election campaign material no differently from any other type of content,” he added.

TikTok was launched in 2016 to enable users to create and share short singing and dancing videos set to well-known songs.

In August 2018, ByteDance scrubbed its other video brand, Musical.ly, in favour of TikTok because it better reflects the breadth of content created on the platform that extends beyond music to comedy, performance art and more, according to a Reuters report on August 2, 2018.

In late 2018, ByteDance was valued at $75 billion."

Updated: Mar 18, 2019 00:08 IST

Four-time Goa chief minister and former defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s colleagues in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) described him as a quintessential swayamsevak (volunteer). On Sunday night as news of this demise broke, colleagues in the Sangh paid tributes to the disciplined, unassuming Goan, who thought nothing of his political achievements or the high office that he occupied.

Parrikar joined the Sangh during his final years of schooling. During his years at Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, he came in contact with Seshadri Chari, who was then incharge of students at the premier engineering institute. Chari said he joined the Sangh as a full-time worker for a year after getting his degree and was posted to Mumbai’s Mapusa. “He became a sanghchalak [local director] for a year and then moved back to Goa where he started his enterprise. He was sent by the Sangh to the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] along with Shripad Naik, when they felt the need to induct some new faces into the party,” Chari said.

Chari, a former editor of the Organiser, said Parrikar initially had qualms about joining politics. “He had apprehensions about politics. He was concerned that he might have to take decisions that his conscience would not permit. He was squeaky clean,” Chari said. Parrikar always wore his Sangh credentials on his sleeve; acknowledging the organisation’s role in instilling discipline, nationalism and social concern in him, said another Sangh functionary who did not wish to be quoted.

Chari said he had no compunction in saying Parrikar was a prototypical swayamsevak. “His image of simple, unpretentious man was not cultivated; that is who he was,” said Chari."

Updated: Mar 06, 2019 19:16 IST

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday accused Narendra Modi of doing opportunistic politics over the dead bodies of jawans and ridiculed the prime minister for trying to paint himself as the lone patriot.

Banerjee vowed to remove the “blacklisted” Modi government from the Centre in the Lok Sabha election and ensure that even the signboards of Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah cease to exist in the country.

“As you (Modi) have done nothing in the last five years, that is why you need to show missiles, bombs and dead bodies of jawans. Don’t you feel ashamed that you are doing opportunistic politics over the dead bodies of jawans? We all stand by our armed forces, for our country, but we are not with the Modi regime,” Banerjee said while addressing a program in Howrah district.

“Those who are questioning the government over the outcome of the airstrikes on Jaish training camps in Balakot are branded as ‘Pakistanis’ as if we all belong to the neighbouring country and only he (Modi) is an Indian,” she said.

The Trinamool Congress chief had recently sought evidence of the airstrike, saying that Opposition parties wanted to know the details of the Indian Air Force (IAF) operations on terror camps in Balakot.

Banerjee and the BJP have been engaged in an intense war of words, with her party hitting out at the latter for allegedly politicising the airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot and the saffron party alleging that the TMC was echoing Pakistan by casting doubts about the attack.

“The BJP should stop lecturing us on patriotism. We don’t need to learn it from them. We are for the country, but we are not there to support the blacklisted Modi government at the Centre. We will remove the signboards of Modi and Amit Shah from this country. Either this country will survive or they will win. The sooner this government is defeated, the better it will be for the country,” Banerjee said.

“Everyday, the BJP leaders are surfing for my religion on websites. I want to tell them my religion is humanity. They (BJP) may not have heard about it as they have blood on their hands,” she said.

The chief minister wryly described Modi as “Gabbar Singh” and alleged that every institution and media houses in the country were being threatened by the BJP-led government. “We have seen several governments, but we have never seen such a prime minister, who is terrorising everybody in this country as if he is a Gabbar Singh.” Gabbar Singh is a fictional character, and the main antagonist of Bollywood movie ‘Sholay’.

Banerjee alleged that more than two crore people had lost their jobs and 12,000 farmers had committed suicide in the country due to demonetisation.

Accusing the BJP government of manipulating data on jobs and GDP, she said: “Modi babu knows only how to manipulate data. Five years are over... this government’s expiry date is over.”"

Updated: Mar 06, 2019 10:09 IST

This week on Grand Tamasha, Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) talks about the aftermath of the recent tensions between India and Pakistan and its ramifications for India’s domestic politics and foreign policy with Alyssa Ayres (Senior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations) and Rezaul Hasan Laskar (Foreign Editor, Hindustan Times).

Although major hostilities have paused, tensions between the two neighbours remain high. But as India’s election approaches, the domestic spin game has begun. The three discuss the government’s approach, the opposition’s positioning, and how international diplomacy fared during the crisis.

Then, Milan speaks with Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at MIT and a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Narang is one of the few scholars to have thought deeply about when foreign policy actually matters for domestic politics in India.

While conventional wisdom holds that foreign policy is an elite issue that does not capture the imagination of the masses, Narang (and co-author Paul Staniland) argue that foreign policy can penetrate mass politics when the issue is salient and the lines of accountability are clear. Narang also explains why Modi and the BJP are likely to benefit from the recent crisis."

Updated: Mar 02, 2019 18:10 IST

Is there a danger that the present unbridled mood of nationalism and heightened anti-Pakistan sentiment could end up damaging India’s sporting interests? To put it colloquially, could we end up cutting our nose to spite our face? I fear the answer is yes.

Let’s start with the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) decision to suspend all discussions about hosting future Olympic-related events in India and to ask all sports federations not to hold events in the country or grant hosting rights to India. This was in response to India’s refusal to grant visas to Pakistani participants for an international shooting championship. The IOC says this was “against the Fundamental Principles of the Olympic Charter, in particular... non-discrimination... and equal treatment of all participating athletes and sporting delegations”. As far as the IOC is concerned, that’s a very serious charge.

The government’s position is that boycotting Pakistan is far more important than hosting international sporting events. But is it? That’s what the issue turns on.

Already an international billiards event in Bangalore has been called off. Additionally, international events planned for later this year in badminton, chess, golf and hockey are in danger. More importantly, India’s hopes of staging the Youth Olympics in 2026, the Asian Games in 2030 and the Summer Olympics in 2032 are now in doubt. Is this a price worth paying for snubbing Pakistan?

The Indian Olympics Association (IOA) insists it is not. Rajeev Mehta, its secretary general, has said: “It’s a big setback for sports in the country.”

Now, the IOC will only withdraw its sanctions if India provides “clear written guarantees” that there will be no discrimination on the participation of athletes. I can’t see that happening before the elections. It would be a damaging climbdown by the government. Who knows if it will happen after that?

The other issue is about what stand should India take about playing Pakistan in cricket? To begin with, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) urging “the cricketing community to sever ties with countries from which terrorism emanates” ie Pakistan. But what are the chances the ICC will agree? It’s very unlikely that major cricketing countries like Australia, England and South Africa will support this demand.

Vinod Rai, the Chairman of the Committee of Administrators, may want to “make it a cricket apartheid for Pakistan” but the undeniable fact is the world does not view Pakistan in 2019 the same way as it viewed South Africa in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

So was it wise for the BCCI to call for severing ties with Pakistan when perhaps no other country agrees? Instead of isolating Pakistan, this could end up isolating India.

Finally, should India play Pakistan in the World Cup? So far we have beaten Pakistan in all the previous World Cups. Now, in 2019, if we refuse to play, I imagine Pakistan will be relieved and delighted and will also get two points without having to fight for them. I don’t see how that benefits India.

If India could play Pakistan at the height of the Kargil War, isn’t it odd to argue that we can’t after Pulwama? Of course, the World Cup is still over three months away and who knows how much further Indo-Pak relations will deteriorate between now and then.

Clausewitz famously said war is politics by other means. I fear we’re about to expand that and add sport is politics by other means.

A day after Robert Vadra hinted at joining politics with a Facebook post, posters welcoming him to contest Lok Sabha election have cropped up in his home town Moradabad.

“Robert Vadra ji you are welcome to contest elections from Moradabad Lok Sabha constituency” said the posters in Hindi.

On Sunday, Vadra raised eyebrows with a Facebook post saying that he wants a larger role in serving the people once the accusations of money laundering against him end.

In Delhi, Vadra ruled out plunging into politics in a hurry.

“First, I need to absolve from baseless accusations and allegations. But yes, I will start working on it. There is no hurry. People need to feel that I can make a change... All in time,” he told ANI when asked if he wanted to join politics and contest polls.

Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit also played down the significance of posters in Moradabad.

“It is up to the workers. Every person expresses himself. Everyone has the freedom to express themselves,” he told ANI.

The BJP responded to the posters sarcastically with Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi describing Vadra as a circus joker.

“This P-R (Priyanka-Rahul) circus was waiting for the entry of a joker and the joker can now be seen,” Naqvi told ANI."

Updated: Feb 19, 2019 19:53 IST

The aftermath of a terror attack in a democracy follows a pattern. All political parties initially express shock, anguish and anger. There are announcements of firm intent and national unity — and emphasis on how this is not the time for politics. This attempt at bipartisanship at the top does not last too long.

The second-rung leaders on the ruling side speak of how their response will be different from past “weak” regimes; their counterparts in the opposition begin blaming the government for intelligence failures and demand action. And slowly, this seeps up — before you know it, the top leaders are engaged in a slanging match.

The responses after Pulwama have followed almost the same pattern. It took only a few days for expressions of unity and how this is an issue of national interest to give way to competitive political jostling. This is not desirable and we do not endorse it — but in the Indian democratic landscape, just months before elections, it is not surprising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strong statements indicate that a major response is in the offing.

This could well be a leader reassuring the nation. But the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) political managers see the attack as a possible opportunity to reinforce their image of a strong party, willing to take strong action against Pakistan, and thus buttress their nationalist credentials. At a time when the political challenge has become formidable for the regime, this will help.

The opposition too can smell an opportunity. By saying they will back the government, and will have no more conversation on the issue, Congress president Rahul Gandhi sought to pre-empt the possibility of the BJP monopolising the credit for any action.

But his party’s managers believe that Pulwama has dealt a blow to the government’s claims of a track record of cracking down on terror; raised questions about the efficacy of the surgical strikes the government so hyped; and put BJP in a bind for they need to now respond but can’t allow a full-blown conflict. Pulwama is no longer just a national security or foreign policy issue. It is now a full-blown domestic political issue."

Updated: Feb 19, 2019 07:52 IST

In the 1995 blockbuster film, Muthu, Rajinikanth’s character comes up with a famous line: “Naan eppo varuven, epdi varuvennu yarukkum theriyathu. Aana var vendiya nerathula correcta vandhuduven” (No one can tell when or how I’ll arrive, but when the time is right, I will be there). For fans of the superstar, the wait seems to have got longer. Rajinikanth, for now, has decided to stay away from the upcoming Lok Sabha polls as he believed the time is not right. He has also declared that he will not support any party.

For professional watchers of the Tamil superstar, this declaration comes as no surprise. Unlike his Kollywood counterpart, Kamal Hassan, who has said his Makkal Needhi Maiyam will contest all 40 seats, Rajinkanth has always been a fence sitter. The only time he openly voiced his political opinion was in 1996 when he declared that even god would not be able to save Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa were to be re-elected. The subsequent electoral losses of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) were duly credited to him.

After that, Rajini has always made just cryptic statements ahead of elections. His stance, however, is a big disappointment to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has struggled to establish itself in the Dravidan land. It is no secret that it has been making efforts behind the scenes to see whether in a post-Jayalalithaa era, a leaderless AIADMK would embrace a charismatic leader. While it may yet cobble together an alliance with the AIADMK, its opponents in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Congress-Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Indian Union Muslim League (DMK-Congress-MDMK-IUML), along with the left parties, will pose a formidable challenge.

The BJP was hoping to offset some of the impending losses in the Hindi heartland with a better performance in the southern states, where it won only 19 of the 132 seats on offer, in 2014. With Rajinikanth queering the pitch, the BJP would now be hoping to strengthen its front by roping in Capt Vijaykanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which has a very strong Vanniyar caste support. While the DMDK is keen for an alliance, the PMK is driving a hard bargain and negotiating with both fronts.

True to his style, Rajinkanth has announced his abstention from this round of polls. But he asked his supporters to vote for a party which was ready to solve water woes of the state. That was enough for BJP sympathisers are now reduced to pointing out that the National Democratic Alliance government had suggested linking the Cauvery and the Godavari. The BJP may yet take heart from another famous Rajni line in the film, Kochadiiyaan: “Vaipugal amayadhu, namdhan amithukolla vendum” (Opportunities don’t just happen, you have to create them.)"

Updated: Feb 08, 2019 16:57 IST

Former Supreme Court judge, justice (retired) Kurian Joseph, who was part of the unprecedented press conference last year by four senior-most judges against the functioning of the chief justice, said on Friday that he has no plan to dabble in politics.

Hailing from Kalady in Ernakulam district, he said both, the ruling Left Democratic Front and Congress-led United Democratic Front, have approached him but he told them he has no plan to throw his hat into the poll fray.

Known for his clean image and secular credentials, both the fronts were racing to pocket him, but he told them in clear terms he has no plan to take a plunge now and he will concentrate more on his home ground, legal affairs.

“Several people from both camps informally approached me. One of them even said I can chose from four seats. But I told them point blank that I am not interested,” he said in Delhi.

“Many offers came. But it is a question of my interest. As of now, it is a big no,” he said scoffing all rumours.

Post retirement last November, justice Joseph has settled in the national capital. Speculation was rife that he will join politics and contest in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

Last year in January, justice Joseph was among four judges who held an unprecedented press conference where they disagreed with then-CJI Dipak Misra’s style of functioning, saying he was assigning important cases to junior judges.

When the worst flood of the century hit Kerala in last August, justice Joseph was at the forefront in coordinating relief supply to the state and also sang “we shall overcome” at a fund-raising event in Delhi.

Starting his legal career in 1979, he held many positions and in 2000, he was appointed as a judge of the Kerala High Court. In 2010, he was elevated as the chief justice of Himachal Pradesh high court and in 2013, became a judge of the Supreme Court."

Updated: Feb 06, 2019 19:10 IST

In a rare rebuke to Pakistan’s powerful military, the top court on Wednesday prohibited them from engaging in political activities and directed spy agencies like the ISI to operate within the law.

Delivering a landmark verdict on the 2017 Faizabad sit-in by the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and other smaller groups, a two-member Supreme Court bench also ordered the government to act against those propagating “hatred, extremism and terrorism”.

“We direct the federal and provincial governments to monitor those advocating hate, extremism and terrorism and prosecute the perpetrators in accordance with the law,” the bench comprising Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Mushir Alam ruled.

The court directed all government agencies and departments, including those run by the army like spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to operate within the limits defined by the law.

The bench ordered that members of the Armed Forces were prohibited from engaging in any kind of political activity, which includes supporting a party, faction or individual.

“The government of Pakistan through the Ministry of Defence and the respective Chiefs of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are directed to initiate action against the personnel under their command who are found to have violated their oath,” the court said.

Several experts were of the view that Prime Minister Imran Khan was supported by the country’s powerful army in the last year’s general election.

Pakistan’s powerful military has ruled the country through various coups for nearly half of the country’s history since independence in 1947. The military plays an important role in the country’s decision making.

The apex court also outlawed religious edicts called fatwas that aimed to harm others.

“A person issuing an edict or fatwa, which harms another or puts another in harm’s way, must be criminally prosecuted under the Pakistan Penal Code, the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and/or the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016,” the court ruled.

The court upheld that subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law, citizens have the right to form and to be members of political parties. They can also assemble for peaceful protest.

It said the right to assemble and protest is circumscribed only to the extent that it infringes on the fundamental rights of others, including their right to free movement and to hold and enjoy property.

The court ordered that those protesters who obstruct people’s right to use roads and damage or destroy property must be proceeded against in accordance with the law and held accountable.

It initiated suo motu proceedings on November 21, 2017 after TLP blocked a main highway leading to Islamabad.

During the 20-day long protest in 2017, daily life in Islamabad was disrupted when protesters belonging to the TLP, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah, the Tehreek-i-Khatm-i-Nabuwwat and the Pakistan Sunni Tehreek occupied the Faizabad Interchange which connects Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the busiest roads in the twin cities."

Updated: Feb 04, 2019 07:49 IST

Union minister Smriti Irani Sunday said she would leave politics the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to hang his boots, though she asserted that he would be around for “long years”.

She was speaking at the Words Count festival here in a discussion titled ‘Scripting Her Story, From Star to Star Campaigner’.

A member of the audience asked her when would one see her as a “pradhan sevak” (prime servant), a title often used by Modi to describe his role as the head of the Union government. “Never. I entered politics to work under charismatic leaders. I was very lucky to work under the leadership of late Atal Bihari Vajpayee and I am currently serving under Modi ji,” Irani replied. “The day ‘pradhan sevak’ Narendra Modi decides to hang his boots, I will also leave Indian politics,” she said. “I decide for myself how much of my life I will give for my country, my society. In an independent country, if I cannot take a decision for myself, what is the use of that independence?” she said. On whether she did not wish to serve under leaders other than Modi, the textile minister said, “Am I not currently working under leaders like Rajnath Singh ji, Nitin Gadkari ji? There are leaders with whom I have worked within the organisation for the last 18 years. I also had the opportunity to work under leaders like Vajpayee and L K Advani.” “You are presuming Modi won’t be there for long, but let me tell you, he is going to be around for very, very long years,” she told the audience.

The BJP leader was also asked whether she would contest the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls from Amethi against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.

She said the decision would be taken by her party and its chief Amit Shah.

“In 2014, when I fought the election, they were asking who is Smriti. In 2019, they know who I am,” she asserted.

Irani had lost to Gandhi in the 2014 general elections from Amethi.

Speaking on the menace of trolling on social media platforms, the actor-turned-politician said she had been trolled by celebrated journalists and politicians and not just by anonymous netizens.

“I might be one of the few people who have been equally trolled by celebrated journalists and politicians and by anonymous trolls,” she said. Talking about the women politicians she admired, Irani named Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj and Lok Sabha Speaker and Indore MP Sumitra Mahajan.

“When they began their journey, it was comparatively tougher. They have made a difference in Indian politics without any additional support. I look up to them as my source of inspiration,” she added."

A Family Business – The Indian National Congress

…On 16 December 2017, in the lead-up to the State Assembly election in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi, the forty-seven year-old ‘reluctant prince’, assumed charge as the president of the 133-year-old party. He became the sixth member10 of the Nehru–Gandhi family to do so, replacing his mother Sonia who had held the post for nineteen years. The Nehru–Gandhi family has ruled the Congress party for forty years of its 133-year history. Rahul was elected unopposed.

During the nineteen years that Sonia Gandhi was at the helm of the Congress party, the BJP had eight presidents.

Gujarat is also where Gandhi, the ‘father’ of the Indian nation was born. Thereby hangs another tale, a successfully contrived narrative. Indira Gandhi married a Parsi, Feroze Gandhi, who was not a relative of the Gujarati Gandhi. Many believed, and in fact continue to believe, that with a family name like Gandhi, winning elections is assured. This is a small but significant starting point to study delusional politics in India.

A young colleague in the Indian Foreign Service related an interesting story. Amongst the thousands who came to greet Sonia Gandhi and her children, Rahul and Priyanka, after the Congress Party’s unexpected victory in the 2004 elections was a person whom the children recognized as an erstwhile security officer assigned to the family. They could not recall the visitor’s name. Before the person concerned had paid his respects and reached home, he had been traced and his appointment to a gubernatorial post was being processed. What, I asked, would have been the reward if they had remembered his name? Pat came the reply, he would have been appointed a cabinet minister.

Many of us have been witness to this almost feudal style of functioning that has come to define the Sonia Gandhi era in the Indian National Congress.

In June 2001, Sonia Gandhi, along with Congress leaders Manmohan Singh, Natwar Singh, Murli Deora and Jairam Ramesh, was to travel to Iceland and the United States. On their way, they made a stop in London, where I was serving as the deputy high commissioner.

Their flight was to land in London in the wee hours, and I was deputed to receive the leader of the Opposition and her party members. Two instances from this meeting still remain with me. I received them at the aerobridge and took them to the Hillingdon Suite at Heathrow. After we had settled down, I noticed that not one of her colleagues had taken a seat on the same sofa as Gandhi—Manmohan Singh and Natwar Singh were seated at one end of the room, while the others stood behind their leader. Unaware of this ‘protocol’, and finding it rather strange that senior leaders of the party refrained from even sitting on the same sofa as their president, I decided to take a seat across from Gandhi.

The second instance, which I remember vividly, happened when we were leaving the airport for their hotel. As the vehicles we had arranged arrived at the gate, not one of Gandhi’s colleagues took the rear seat in the same car with her.

I found this entire episode rather peculiar and was reminded of the ‘divine right of kings’. Gandhi was treated and put on the pedestal as though she were a monarch in the sixteenth century, asserting power over her subjects in the Indian National Congress. It is still not clear whether this kind of subservience was demanded or was readily forthcoming. God, for the Congress party, was somehow synonymous with the Nehru–Gandhi surname.



The Secularism Debate—Hypocrisy within Our Midst

Is secularism under threat in India? If yes, since when and from where is that threat emanating?

Those on the left of the political spectrum, who have thus far dominated the political discourse in India, paint the secular discussion as the majority i.e. Hindu, versus minority, i.e. Muslim.

They argue that since a majority of the Indians believe in the Hindu faith, those who practise Islam are under constant threat. They would like the nation to believe the Hindus of the country are out to get the Muslims — whether this is a colonial hangover is best answered by a distinguished sociologist, but in my view, this is pure delusional politics, which uses victimization for votes. Before calling out the hypocrisy of this discourse, it is important to address the issue of lynching of those belonging to the Muslim faith or a lower caste. At one stage, there seemed to have been an increase in the number of such cases.

Even one case of lynching should be roundly condemned and be regarded as one too many. There has to be zero tolerance for such and other acts of bestiality and criminality. That the miscreants drew inspiration and, in some cases, even encouragement from a ‘saffronized’ authority now in power has been alleged but not conclusively proved. But to focus on just this one aspect of a crime so heinous only helps draw political mileage and doesn’t necessarily solve the problem.

The explanation, the real, underlying cause, can be found in the enabling environment characterized by the complete absence of any sense of accountability and a culture of impunity prevalent in large parts of the Hindi heartland, in the very cow belt that has been allowed to go unpunished for seven decades under various governments headed either by the Congress party, or the plethora of parties that call themselves ‘secular and socialist’.

Aroon Purie, writing as editor-in-chief of India Today on 14 July 2017, stated Ashis Nandy’s reference to a ‘chartered accountancy of violence’. This is interesting because the people who plan these attacks, he says, are not driven by faith or fanaticism but by calculations of political power. He says lynchings are a manifestation of a new type of abstracted, free floating violence seeking a soft target. The deeper reason is that underlying tensions in society cause such resentments to explode into rage. Social mobility has not gone hand in hand with social cohesion. People are living in cities without imbibing civil values. Anyone who looks, prays, eats and lives differently from the majority becomes the enemy. Sociologist Dipankar Gupta ascribes it to the imperfect establishment of the rule of law. ‘Violence is also endemic where law enforcement officials are ambiguous about their role or are partisan in the performance of their duties’.

And here I would like to point out the hypocrisy peddled by Indian liberals under the garb of strengthening Indian secularism.

As per these individuals, any public display of embracing religion in India is fine, as long as it is not Hinduism. To call oneself a Hindu draws ire and labels such as communal if not worse. The following example illustrates this point:

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to wear a skull cap offered to him by a maulana in 2011, he was chastised by liberals for being disrespectful to Indian Muslims.

Rahul Gandhi too recently was chastised for stoking communalism, but this time for embracing his Hindu faith! On the campaign trail during the 2017 Gujarat State Assembly election, the Congress scion was photographed offering prayers at Hindu temples, and a leaked video showed him telling party workers he was a Shivaite.

Author Hardeep Singh Puri ( Jay Mandal )

In no other country, do we see the faith of the majority so routinely treated as the ‘other’. The majority Hindu population, its faith and cultures, are tolerant and have contributed to the peace and harmony such a diverse population enjoys. The public acceptance of one faith over another is a deeply divisive tactic deployed for political gain, and it’s time to call out those who have peddled this argument for decades.

More than seventy years after independence, 224 million Indians still live below the poverty line and India accounts for one-third of the world’s poor. Much of our physical infrastructure, railways, roads, ports, etc., need huge infusion of capital. More importantly, two of our crucial ‘systems’— healthcare and education—are falling apart. They need improvement and reform to give the average Indian citizen a decent chance for a normal subsistence-level existence.

The only real way forward to counter this communal versus secular discourse is to put India in a high growth path and address the challenge of poverty, and abject poverty, of these 172 million.

Prime Minister Modi’s Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas motto— vision of equal development for all sections of society—has the potential to transcend these issues of caste and religion. When the entire country grows, and reaps the benefits of economic development, our peaceful ethos only gets strengthened.

Endorsements for Delusional Politics :

“Delusional Politics is a sophisticated and deep reflection on the technological, political, economic and social forces driving this tumultuous era in global affairs. As a diplomat, policymaker and politician, Hardeep Singh Puri cuts through common opinion to reveal new insights into our present malaise. Rich in both historical and contemporary examples, it argues a number of thought-provoking and controversial propositions. This is an important contribution to the debate about the future of the global order – and how we might fix it.”

- Kevin Rudd, former PM of Australia and President, Asia Society Policy Institute



“Hardeep Puri’s book Delusional Politics is insightful, thought provoking, superbly researched and deftly crafted. While it’s an engaging story on global politics and global governance – and a textbook battle plan for anyone who wants to formulate foreign policy in today’s world – it is much more – it’s a fascinating read!

The lucid, open hearted account makes interesting and informative reading for academics and practitioners alike. Hardeep Puri’s unique experience and brilliant writing brings out the authentic richness of the world we are living in. The book could well be the key to all our futures.”

-Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer, National Institute for Transforming India (NITI Aayog)



Hardeep Singh Puri has, among other atttributes, that rarest of qualities: lucidity of mind. If you want to learn about current events, read his accounts in Delusional Politics. Every chapter is a summary that cuts through the journalistic noise to give you the pure signal. Like a classical chronicler he manages to provide clarity about what happens in our time, put things in context, and deliver to you the proper context to make up your mind. It is as if a historian covered the present with the same filtering one can only possibly apply to the past.”

This is a diplomat-politician’s unsparing political scrutiny of the rise of populism and a bruising shift from facts to belief-based politics in the post-truth era. The book looks at how Donald Trump’s rise has more to do with white-working class woes than with racism; and how Narendra Modi’s popularity is a break from the culture of impunity that existed before him. While populism has been a realty in democracies for long, he says, social media can be its force multiplier. This results in delusional politics, and delusional decision-making.

Actor-politician Kamal Haasan Wednesday described as a “worthwhile dream” Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s promise of minimum income for the poor but said implementing it would be very difficult.

Addressing reporters here after launching the Puducherry unit of his party Makkal Needhi Maiam, he also welcomed Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s foray into active politics.

“It is a great dream, nice dream. I would not say it is epiphany. But is a nice worthwhile dream. We’ll pursue it.

But to enact and actually bring it into force is very difficult. I hope he (Rahul) succeeds,” Haasan said.

Addressing a ‘Kisaan Abhaar Sammelan’ in Raipur on Monday, Rahul Gandhi had promised Congress would ensure “minimum income guarantee” for every poor person if it comes to power at the Centre.

When asked about his opinion on Vadra being appointed Congress general secretary, Hassan said “Welcome sister.”

On the Ram temple issue, the MNM leader said he stood for amity and unity of the country.

“My personal opinion, which I have said in 1993 or 94 as soon as Babri masjid was demolished. I was the single voice which rose from here. I still stand by it. I am very sure any sensible Indian would stand for amity and unity of India,” he said.

Answering questions on alliances for fighting the upcoming general elections, he said the executive committee of his party had given him the authority to decide on it, but no time limit had been set to take the call.

“We are deliberating on it. It is very important to not carry other people’s laundry,” he said without elaborating."

Updated: Jan 29, 2019 15:58 IST

A firebrand trade unionist and socialist, George Fernandes belonged to a rare bunch of political leaders who rose above caste, religious and regional identities to leave an indelible mark on Indian politics. Born in Mangalore in a Christian family in 1930, he was a staunch anti-Congress leader. His tie-up with the BJP in mid 1990s was crucial in ending the saffron party’s isolation in alliance politics as many ‘secular’ parties followed his cue and propelled it to power twice under Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s leadership.

His underground crusade against the Emergency catapulted him among the leading opposition figures. A photograph of Fernandes, with his shock of unkempt hair, raising a manacled hand in defiance remains one of the most enduring images of those times.

Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Fernandes’ colleague for years in several socialist parties, said his unimpeachable commitment to democracy and willingness to go to any length to propagate his cause was an inspiration to him and many others during the Emergency. Fernandes entered the the electoral politics with a bang after he, as the Samyukta Socialist Party candidate, defeated seasoned Congress leader S K Patila in Bombay South constituency in 1967.

An active trade unionist, he was involved in the railway strike in 1974, which disrupted train services across the country and invited a massive government crackdown.

He later shifted his political base to Muzaffarpur in Bihar and won the election from there in 1977.

He was appointed the industries minister in the Janata Party government, and his tenure was marked with multinational firms Coca Cola and IBM shutting down their Indian operations as he pushed hard government regulations.

Long a trenchant critic of the BJP and its ideological parent Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, he warmed up to its top leaders L K Advani and Vajpayee as the national politics saw the rise of regional chieftains, including Lalu Prasad in Bihar.

It is believed that he played a key role in bringing Nitish Kumar, who like Fernandes had begun drifting away from Prasad, then Bihar chief minister, to the BJP-led alliance after the 1995 assembly polls in the state.

He became the defence minister in the Vajpayee government and it was under his tenure that the nuclear test in Pokhran was conducted in 1998 and India fought the Kargil war against Pakistan in 1999.

With Alzheimer’s disease afflicting him, he was out of the public eye for close to a decade as his family members nursed him at home.

Some will say that it was, in a way, a fitting end to his political career when he fought a lonely battle from Muzaffarpur in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls after his party JD(U) denied him a ticket as Alzheimer’s hit him.

Sadly, it was one electoral battle he lost.

A day after Congress president Rahul Gandhi appointed sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh East, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan termed it a “good thing” but with a little twist. Priyanka Gandhi’s appointment was viewed as a masterstroke by the Congress leadership.

Mahajan, however, spiced her welcoming comment to align it with her political party, the BJP, which described Priyanka Gandhi’s joining of the as an acceptance of Rahul Gandhi’s failure by the Congress party. Mahajan too toed the same line.

“She (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) is a good woman and Rahulji has accepted he can’t do politics all alone, and for that he is taking Priyanka’s help. It is a good thing,” Mahajan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Earlier on Wednesday before heading to his parliamentary constituency in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi officially handed over to Priyanka Gandhi the responsibility to manage politically challenging eastern Uttar Pradesh. The Congress has weak organisational strength in the region, which is the home turf for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and also holds the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi.

The eastern Uttar Pradesh is considered key to BJP’s strategy for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Priyanka Gandhi’s appointment is considered to give a boost to the Congress workers in the region. Before taking up the official responsibility of UP East, Priyanka Gandhi had limited her political activities only in two parliamentary constituencies of Amethi and Rae Bareli, represented in the Lok Sabha by brother Rahul and mother Sonia Gandhi respectively.

Priyanka Gandhi had previously resisted all attempts by the Congress workers and leaders to get her join active politics. She always preferred to work behind the scene and keep the two Lok Sabha constituencies in her focus.

The latest move by the Congress has opened up the political game in the most populous state. Priyanka Gandhi’s new role in the Congress gains immense political significance in the wake of seat sharing arrangement announced recently by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP).

BSP chief Mayawati and SP president Akhilesh Yadav joined hands virtually ignoring the Congress. However, they stated that the alliance would not put up candidates against Rahul and Sonia Gandhi from Amethi and Rae Bareli respectively.

Updated: Jan 23, 2019 15:24 IST

Former IAS officer Shah Faesal Wednesday launched a crowdfunding campaign for “clean politics and corruption-free administration” in Jammu and Kashmir.

The 2010-batch topper of the UPSC civil services exam said it was a people’s movement for change. “Be a part of this journey for clean politics and corruption-free administration in J&K. Support Shah Faesal with your small donations,” he tweeted.

Faesal, who resigned from government service earlier this month, gave a bank account number for contributions and said payments could also be made through e-wallet.

He had said the resignation was to protest “unabated killings in Kashmir, and lack of any sincere reach-out from the Union government; the marginalisation and invisiblisation of around 200 million Indian Muslims at the hands of Hindutva forces reducing them to second-class citizens; insidious attacks on the special identity of J&K and growing culture of intolerance and hate in mainland India in the name of hypernationalism”.

While he has made it clear that he would like to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Faesal has not joined any political party so far.

Speculation is rife that he might float a new political outfit.

Updated: Jan 20, 2019 19:35 IST

As you probably know, one of the triggers for the great revolt of 1857 (or the First War of Independence or the Mutiny, depending on your perspective) was a story that spread across India. According to those who claimed to be in the know, the British army had coated cartridges with animal fat. Soldiers had to bite off the covering of the cartridges to use them. This meant that they ended up eating bits of the animal fat.

But, or so went the story, the fat came from cows and pigs. So soldiers were now required to consume beef fat and pork fat. This offended both Hindus and Muslims and led to revolts in army units.

The British said that no pig or cow fat was used and that the story was just a rumour. But when it comes to the politicisation of food, facts often count for less than perceptions. (And it is entirely possible that the Brits were lying, anyway!) Much of today’s so-called food history tends to be only about perception. Truth seems to matter less and less.

Ancient texts such as The Arthashastra contain many references to meat eating

In fact, I am beginning to believe that, at no point since 1857, has food been as politicised as it is today. The renewed furore about beef eating is mostly political. The battle between khichri and biryani is really not about rice dishes at all. It is about so-called Hindu foods and Muslim foods. And the debate is prolonged only for political reasons.

In the popular imagination, a certain caricature of Indian food habits persists. According to this version, good Hindus were always vegetarians. Meat eating was a great sin. Beef eating was an even greater sin. Then, along came the Mughals. They promoted meat eating. They took their biryanis all over India and contaminated the pure vegetarian Indian tradition.

By prosecuting those who eat beef and by honouring vegetarianism, we are told, our country is going back to ancient Indian traditions. We are restoring this great Hindu nation to a time when gods walked the earth and peace ruled the land.

India was never a vegetarian country. The view that ancient Hindus were all vegetarians is nothing but a myth

The problem with this caricature is that almost every single fact in it is wrong.

First of all, India was never a vegetarian country. Whether you went North or South in ancient India, the kings usually ate meat. (So did the gods in our epics.) Ancient Indian rulers did not just eat meat or chicken. They ate tortoises, deer, peacocks and other birds and animals.

Khichri became popular not because of our devotion to vegetarian cuisine, but because it was cheap and easy to cook ( Shutterstock )

Even during the Indus Valley Civilisation, one of the world’s oldest urban civilisations dating back to 3,000 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, animals were raised and slaughtered for food. During the Vedic period, non-vegetarianism was common. Even Ayurveda, which we regard now as a purely Hindu vegetarian phenomenon, advocated remedies based on meat.

The popularity of vegetarianism came from the Jain, rather than Hindu, tradition. Even the Buddha (who came after Mahavir and the founding of Jainism) did not insist on vegetarianism. (Indians are always shocked to discover that the Dalai Lama eats meat; he ate beef till his doctors told him to go easy on red meat.) Ancient texts such as The Arthashastra contain many references to meat eating.

Indians are often shocked to find out that the Dalai Lama eats meat ( Shutterstock )

So, the view that ancient Hindus were all vegetarians is a myth.

What about the Mughals, the subject of much demonisation these days? Well, almost everything that you will read on many popular Internet sites about the Mughals is wrong.

First of all, they did not call themselves the Mughals. That name was given to them centuries later by British historians on the grounds that Babur’s mother may have descended from Genghis Khan. Babur himself would have been horrified to have been called a Mongol or a Mughal.

Keeping in mind Hindu sensitivities about the cow, Emperor Akbar banned its slaughter

Secondly, the Mughals did not arrive in India, defeat valiant Hindu kings and then establish a beef-eating, tyrannical dynasty. There had been Muslim rulers in India for centuries. Babur defeated the Delhi Sultanate, a Muslim kingdom and not some perfect embodiment of Ram Rajya.

Thirdly, the Mughals did not turn a peace-loving, grass-grazing, meat-abjuring populace into non-vegetarians. Not only were the Muslim kings before the arrival of the Mughals non-vegetarians, but so were many Hindus.

If anything, the Mughals were actually less keen on meat than many Hindu kings had been. Many Mughal Kings and nobles would give up meat before battles. And the Emperor Akbar developed such a distaste for meat that he became virtually vegetarian in later life. Keeping in mind medieval (but not necessarily ancient) Hindu sensitivities about the cow, he actually banned cow slaughter. He drank only Ganga jal.

Opinions vary on when the biryani was invented, but there is no doubt that it is an entirely Indian dish ( iStock )

Many of these practices were continued by his son Jahangir and his grandson Shah Jahan, both of whom were vegetarian on certain days of the week and continued to impose Akbar’s ban on cow slaughter. (They also drank Ganga jal.)

So yes, the Mughals were non-vegetarians. But then so were many Hindus. And the so-called Mughlai cuisine served in restaurants today does the Mughals a great injustice. Most of the recipes and many of the dishes have nothing to do with the Mughal court.

Which brings us to the whole khichri versus biryani debate. In today’s crude popular parlance, khichri is truly Hindu whereas biryani is some Middle-Eastern dish brought to India by the Mughals.

This is nonsense.

Khichri is Indian but it is not, and never was, purely Hindu. Indians of all religions ate it (Buddhists, Jains and even Muslims). Nor was there only one type of khichri.

In medieval India, any dish that combined grain and lentils came to be called khichri. So there were hundreds of variations.

Shah Jahan was vegetarian on some days of the week

Let’s take the example of one variation that delighted the Emperor Humayun and the Shah of Persia. One of Persia’s great claims to fame is that it says it invented an early version of the pulao and sent it around the world. It became pilaf in Turkey, paella in Spain and risotto in Italy. But even the Persians will concede that they borrowed one great rice dish from India.

When Humayun lost his throne, he spent 15 years in exile. He spent much of that period in Persia seeking the help of the Shah. During this period, his cooks taught the Shah’s local cooks how to make khichri. This variation used peas and delighted the Shah.

When Humayun reclaimed his throne, this North Indian variation of khichri became a staple of the Mughal court until Jahangir (Humayun’s grandson) found a new kind of khichri while travelling through Gujarat. This khichri was made from millets not rice and it soon became the Emperor’s favourite dish (though the court cooks used more ghee than the Gujarati original). And it was cooked in the palace kitchen nearly every day.

Mughlai dishes served today have nothing to do with the Mughal court

Why was khichri so popular all over India? Not because of our devotion to vegetarian cuisine. It was a one pot meal that used dal (one of the defining characteristics of Indian cuisine through the ages) and any local grain that was available (not just rice). People ate it mainly because it was cheap and easy to cook. During wars, when soldiers would cook their own food, there would often be hundreds of fires lit before a battle as each solider made his own khichri.

Most khichris were vegetarian because even non-vegetarian Indians found meat too expensive. (This was as true of the rest of the world, even England under say, Henry VIII, where the nobles consumed all kinds of animals while the peasantry could not afford much meat.)

Which takes us to biryani. Did it descend from the pulao? Probably, but it had to be wetter, more heavily spiced, was usually ‘assembled’ (the meat and rice were first cooked separately in most biryanis, whereas everything was cooked together in a pulao) and it was a main dish, whereas a pulao was a side dish.

Opinions vary on when it was invented (one popular version gives the credit to Akbar’s cooks; others say it was created a century before) but there is no doubt that it is an entirely Indian dish.

So don’t believe all the currently popular lies about pure vegetarians and evil beef-eating invaders. There is no all-Hindu khichri nor any invader biryani. The history of Indian food is too complex for simple stereotypes. And our cuisine is too great for its history to be twisted to suit the needs of today’s political debates.

Politicians will come and go. But India’s many wonderful cuisines will outlast them all.

Updated: Jan 09, 2019 18:45 IST

Shah Faesal, the outspoken IAS topper whose success inspired many young Kashmiris to join the civil services, announced on Wednesday that he has decided to resign from the government and join electoral politics. Faesal, 35, attributed his decision to protest what he described as “the unabated killings in Kashmir and absence of any credible political initiative from Union Government”.

“I have decided to resign from IAS. Kashmiri lives matter,” Faesal said in a Facebook post that was severely critical of the central government.

Faesal, a 2010-batch IAS officer, was the first Kashmiri to top the civil services examination held by the Union Public Services Commission, or UPSC. His appointment was then seen to reflect the changing mindset of Kashmiris.

In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Faesal, however, said he will announce his plans on Friday. He is expected to join the National Conference and contest the Lok Sabha polls from Barmulla in north Kashmir.

Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah welcomed Faesal to politics.

“The bureaucracy’s loss is politics’ gain. Welcome to the fold @shahfaesal,” Abdullah tweeted.

Abdullah refrained from outlining any more details, saying Shah Faesal’s “future political plans are his to announce”.

Omar Abdullah has supported Shah Faesal on social media more than once, particularly when Faesal was trolled for his blunt remarks. He was as scathing in his Facebook post announcing his decision to resign.

“I wish to reiterate that voices of reason in this country cannot be muzzled for long and the environment of siege will need to end if we wish to usher in true democracy,” he wrote.

Faesal, from Jammu and Kashmir’s Kupwara district, got into trouble with the government last year and was issued a show-cause notice for tweeting a comment on a story of a man raping his mother.

“Patriarchy+Population+Illiteracy+Alcohol+Porn+Technology+Anarchy = Rapistan!,” Faesal had tweeted in April over a story titled “Porn addict rapes 46 year old mom, arrested in Gujarat”.

In August last, he said repealing of Article 35A of the Constitution would end Jammu and Kashmir’s relationship with the rest of the country. “I would compare Article 35A to a marriage-deed/nikahnama. You repeal it and the relationship is over. Nothing will remain to be discussed afterwards,” he said in a tweet.

“Let’s not confuse the issue. Sovereignty and integrity of India can’t be challenged. Not at all. But the Constitution has kept some special provisions for J&K state. It’s a unique arrangement. It isn’t a threat to India’s integrity at all,” he said.

Article 35A empowers the Jammu and Kashmir state’s legislature to define “permanent residents” of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents."

Updated: Dec 31, 2018 07:47 IST

In 2018, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress told us two different stories about India. This is not surprising, for politics is often about storytelling. Indian politics is no exception. And that is why the BJP and Congress’ stories of 2018 will be central to how 2019 shapes up. There are three distinct elements of the story both sides are telling. They revolve around quality of life; corruption; and identity, democracy and institutions.

The-quality-of-life story

In the BJP story, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government fixed India’s welfare architecture. By using the socio-economic caste census, geospatial tagging, Aadhaar and direct benefits transfer, the government identified the needy beneficiaries. It ensured the end — or minimisation — of leakages. It eliminated intermediaries. And it delivered benefits.

In this narrative, the government has finally provided housing to rural Indians. It has provided toilets. It has provided electricity. And it has also ensured the distribution of gas cylinders —under the Ujjwala scheme — to over 50 million beneficiaries. Besides the individual benefits, the government also claims that rural roads have witnessed a wide expansion.

And so here is the centrepiece of the Modi story: a government committed to the ease of living; a government committed to the poorest and most invisible Indians; a government that has changed the way rural India lives, cooks and travels.

In the Congress’s story, the government has destroyed the dreams and aspirations of the two most important demographic groups — farmers and the youth.

It is, the Opposition narrative goes, the government’s dramatically poor economic management that has created a debilitating situation. It announced demonetisation, squeezed the economy, disrupted every sector, jolted growth and destroyed jobs. It pushed through a poorly designed Goods and Services Tax regime, which India’s small and medium scale industries were thoroughly unprepared for, especially because it came soon after demonetisation.

This story holds that manufacturing goals have all but collapsed, with Make in India simply not able to generate the scale of jobs needed to accommodate a million-plus people who enter the Indian workforce every year.

The story in agriculture, in this narrative, is particularly distressing. The government has failed to provide the minimum support prices according to the Swaminathan commission’s formula. Farmers are also suffering from enormous debt.

The Congress’s story hinges on acute economic distress across urban and rural India — with the country represented by the angry, aspirational, impatient young men and women seeking jobs.

The corruption story

The second axis of the debate revolves around corruption, a key plank of the BJP’s victory in 2014.

The BJP story goes back to “legacy issues” it has had to grapple with, particularly in the realm of non-performing assets. This itself, the BJP holds, was a function of crony capitalism that marked the Congress regimes where phone calls to bankers led to loans which were unviable in the boom years.

The government claims it recognised the problem. It has sought to address the underlying roots of this crisis by bringing in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code so that there is an exit for bad capital. It has, through legislations like RERA, ensured that the real estate and construction sector has stronger regulation.

The BJP story also holds that central-level corruption has reduced drastically. No big scam has been institutionally proven in this period. And the PM in particular represents an image of integrity.

In the Opposition’s narrative, the government is the epitome of crony capitalism. Rahul Gandhi’s attack on Rafale is meant to portray Modi as embedded with corporate interests. It has picked on Vijay Mallya’s exit from India as the proof of government’s collusion. And the Congress cites Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi bank fraud as absolute proof of how this is a government complicit with corruption. It portrays demonetisation as a scam.

The identity story

The BJP believes, and would like Indian citizens to believe, that the nation has finally found its rightful place on the world stage. This is as much as function of Modi’s diplomacy as India’s renewed confidence, which comes from a strong sense of nationalism. This nationalism, in turn, has a strong cultural — read Hindu — ethos.

Minority appeasement, this story goes, has ended. Citizens are treated equally. The Hindus are no longer ashamed to be Hindus.

The Congress, and the wider Opposition, believes India is at a turning point and its nationalism project, instead of becoming stronger, is in jeopardy.

In this view, nationalism has come to be increasingly associated with Hindu majoritarianism. It has become synonymous with marginalisation and public disdain for minorities. There is impunity for mob violence, especially when directed at minorities.

No two stories could be more at odds with each other. Which of these a majority of Indian citizens believes will determine who gets to govern the country for the next five years."

Updated: Dec 28, 2018 11:41 IST

Earlier in December, a collective called Artists Unite! released a manifesto that promised resistance to the divisive politics that has dominated public discourse in 2018. “The emancipatory and spiritual possibilities of culture are being replaced by a language that relies solely on war cries, propaganda and the images, metaphors, visions and sounds of supremacy. The ongoing assault on culture is an attack on democracy. As artists and cultural practitioners we are and will continue to resist the politics of hate,” declared Artists Unite!, which is planning a “national convention” in February 2019.

Whatever it may achieve in the future, at present the manifesto of Artists Unite! has more than 500 signatories. Culture, dear reader, is a battleground.

In 21st century India, this is unprecedented. The political activism of the 1970s is a distant memory for most, given the way the State squashed student movements of that era and the fact that the bulk of our population is under 25. It hasn’t helped that we don’t have a sustained tradition of radical or political art. Barring a select few, most of our artists make strenuous efforts to come across as neutral. If politics or ideology informs their work, it is usually so subtle that invisible ink seems obvious in comparison. The stereotype of the artist may be that of a bohemian troublemaker, but the reality is that Indian cultural practitioners are usually docile and non-confrontational. The few who systematically challenge the establishment stand out because they are exceptions rather than the rule.

However, what we do have in India is a robust tradition of being offended. MF Husain’s paintings of Hindu goddesses, Perumal Murugan’s novel One Part Woman, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat, TM Krishna’s concerts are all examples of art that wasn’t necessarily political by nature, but nevertheless got politicised. What’s become increasingly obvious is that if we want culture and entertainment rather than censorship, we’d better develop a political spine.

With electoral politics eager to use the arts to further a toxic agenda, it’s worth keeping in mind that when an ideological stand is taken mindfully, the risk of being exploited is lower. For instance, there’s no mistaking artist Navjot Altaf’s disapproval of government policies in Chhattisgarh because she articulates it clearly in her video, “Soul Breath, Wind”. Against visuals of lush naturescapes, we hear locals denounce unregulated mining and mourn the environmental damage being done in the name of development. “I am not poor,” says a resident. “I am made to feel poor.”

Her 125-minute long video, “Trail of Impunity”, offers a record of what happened before, during and after the Gujarat riots of 2002, and raises questions for the present and future. “What is the effect of hate speech on the electoral process?” asks lawyer Teesta Setalvad in the video that was made in 2014. More poetic is Altaf’s installation “Lacuna of Testimony”, which uses video projection and mirrors to mesmerising effect. Made in 2003, it shows fragmentary images of violence – armed men, burning buildings, terrified people lined up – that indicate how trauma can distort narratives.

Seeing the 100-plus works in Altaf’s retrospective at the National Gallery of Modern Art (on display in Mumbai), you get a sense of what a treasure this artist is. Ever since the 1970s, when she emerged on the Indian art scene, Altaf has fought for those who are underprivileged and raised uncomfortable questions to those in power. She’s sold her art for cheap – you could snap up one of her works for as much as Rs 25 in the mid-1970s – to make it accessible to the middle classes. In 1998, she shifted to a village in Bastar and has since worked with local artists in the area. Unfazed by tags like Samovar Naxalite (Samovar was a legendary café at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai), Altaf has remained curious, passionate and angry. Her art doesn’t compromise on either aesthetics or idealism. Whether it’s a video or a print, her command over the form is masterful. The best of her works engage you at both an emotional and intellectual level. In an art market, the value of her work is unremarkable. For a society at crossroads, however, Altaf’s art is invaluable.

Given the year began with the dark absurdity of Padmaavat being exploited for political gain, perhaps the shiniest silver lining is that we can end 2018 by raising a toast to the indomitable spirit of Altaf’s art.

Updated: Dec 24, 2018 11:24 IST

Rarely have Indian events and issues figured so prominently in London as in 2018, when the British capital played host to a calendar of conflict similar to everyday life back home.

The Vijay Mallya extradition saga rolled on throughout the year, while the cut-and-thrust of domestic politics was reflected in two high-profile visits: by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April and by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in August.

Strengths and challenges of Indian law, banking, prisons, politics and the media were closely examined during the Mallya extradition hearings, as the businessman used the media scrum outside the court to try and change the narrative that he stole money from India. The Westminster magistrates court recommended his extradition, but many hoops remain before it can happen.

On the diplomatic front, there was a change of guard in India House, when Y K Sinha retired and Ruchi Ghanshyam took over as only the second woman high commissioner since 1947 (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was the first).

One Indian issue that has long endured in the UK is the row over ‘Khalistan’, which figured during Modi’s visit, when the Indian flag was torn by a supporter; a rally in Trafalgar Square in August seeking a so-called ‘referendum’; and a senior Indian official prevented from entering the Shepherd’s Bush gurdwara in November.

In July, the Theresa May government brought the curtain down on the sensitive issue of enacting a law to bar caste-based discrimination. It decided not to legislate but to rely on emerging case-law courts.

The 1.5 million-strong Indian community is deeply divided on the issue, with influential Hindu, Sikh and Jain lobbies denying that caste-based discrimination exists, stating that enacting such a law would entrench ideas of caste where none exist, while several Dalit and other groups insist it exists in Britain.

During most of 2018, there were four Indian-origin ministers in the May government: Alok Sharma, Shailesh Vara, Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman (nee Fernandes), but Brexit-related concerns prompted Vara and Braverman to resign in November. Preet Kaur Gill was appointed shadow minister for international development.

Indian community continued to figure prominently in royal honours lists. Neil Basu was appointed head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terror operations, while Imtiyaz Shaikh, who hails from Vasco da Gama, became the first councillor of Goa origin to be elected to the council in Swindon.

For the first time, a Sikh soldier of the Coldstream Guards - Charanpreet Singh Lall - figured in the in traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace for Queen Elizabeth’s birthday in June.

History has forever entwined India and the United Kingdom at various levels, but rarely have Indian events and issues figured so prominently in London as in 2018.

The Vijay Mallya extradition saga rolled on throughout the year, while the cut-and-thrust of domestic politics was reflected in two high-profile visits: the April visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Commonwealth Summit, and the August visit of Congress president Rahul Gandhi to interact with policymakers, MPs, scholars as well as Indian journalists and students.

Strengths and challenges of Indian law, banking, prisons, politics and the media were closely examined during the Mallya extradition hearings, as the flamboyant businessman used the media contingent waiting outside the court to try and change the narrative that he stole money from India.

The Westminster magistrates court recommended Mallya’s extradition, but many hoops remain before this can happen. He, however, remains enmeshed in several other legal cases, including those seeking to possess his houses and assets.

On the diplomatic front, there was a change of guard in India House, when Y K Sinha retired and Ruchi Ghanshyam took over as only the second woman high commissioner since 1947 (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was the first).

One Indian issue that has long endured in the UK is the row over ‘Khalistan’, which figured during Modi’s visit when the Indian flag was torn by a Khalistan supporter; a rally in Trafalgar Square in August seeking a so-called ‘referendum’ for the independence of Punjab ; and a senior Indian official prevented from entering the Shepherd’s Bush gurdwara in November.

In July, the Theresa May government brought the curtain down on the sensitive issue of enacting a law to bar caste-based discrimination. After years of debate, it decided not to legislate but to rely on emerging case-law courts.

The 1.5 million-strong Indian community has been deeply divided on the issue, with influential Hindu, Sikh and Jain lobbies denying that caste-based discrimination exists in Britain and contending that enacting such a law would entrench ideas of caste where none exist, while several individuals, Dalit and other groups insist it exists.

Also for the first time, a Sikh soldier of the Coldstream Guards – Charanpreet Singh Lall – figured in the in traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony at Buckingham Palace for Queen Elizabeth’s birthday in June.

Meanwhile, Neil Basu was appointed head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terror operations, while Imtiyaz Shaikh, who hails from Vasco da Gama, became the first councillor of Goan origin to be elected to the council in Swindon.

On Independence Day, Scotland Yard returned to the Indian high commission a 12th century Buddha statue that was stolen from the Archaeological Survey of India’s museum in Nalanda, Bihar, in August 1961, and recovered in the UK.

The year also saw a school in England launch a unique course on ‘Hinglish’, the popular portmanteau of English and Hindi used in Indian films, newspaper headlines, television and everyday discourse. Teachers in the school are surprised at the interest in the course.

The India-UK links also extended to the difficult world of stammering. A delighted Matthew Richardson, returning after conducting the first McGuire Programme in New Delhi in December for 30 people, said, “They arrived as people unable to speak effectively and left as proud public speakers. Helping people in India to break the stigma of stammering is something I am very proud of”.

And finally, ‘Bihar Diwas’, on March 22, was celebrated in a unique location: Patna, in Scotland, a village in East Ayrshire founded in the early nineteenth century by a Briton, who was born in Patna, Bihar but returned to Scotland, to house mine workers. The chief guest was also appropriate: the Patna-born Y K Sinha, the former high commissioner."

Lalu Prasad’s elder son and RJD MLA Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday made a sudden appearance at the party’s state headquarters in Patna and held a long discussion with youth and student wing workers and declared he was back to active politics.

Yadav reached the RJD office at Veer Chand Patel Marg in the afternoon wearing his trademark ‘bhasma tilak’. He has been keeping a low profile for the past several months on account of alleged differences with his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav, a claim he has refused, and estrangement with his wife of six months from whom he has sought divorce. After holding over two-hour discussions with the party workers, the former Bihar minister addressed a press conference where he showered praise on Rahul Gandhi for leading the Congress to victory in the assembly polls in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

He asserted that he considered the BJP-RSS combine as the principal opponent in Bihar. “I have returned to Bihar after receiving the blessings of Lord Krishna during my pilgrimage. The state will emerge as Kurukshetra in the Lok Sabha polls and our detractors will be slayed with the Sudarshan Chakra of popular vote,” he said.

Yadav refused to take any queries on his decision to divorce Aishwarya Rai, daughter of fellow RJD MLA Chandrika Rai, whom he had married in May this year.

Replying to a query, he reiterated that he saw Tejashwi as “Arjuna” and vowed to play the role of Lord Krishna who was the warrior prince’s charioteer in the Mahabharata.

Speculations have been rife that Tej Pratap Yadav has been unhappy over being overshadowed by his younger brother, who is considered a favourite of their father and has emerged as the RJD’s de facto leader in the absence of Lalu Prasad, who is serving sentences in fodder scam cases. There have also been reports that Tej Pratap enjoys the support of their eldest sister Misa Bharti, the only daughter of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi to have entered politics and is said to be uncomfortable with the leadership of the more suave and savvy younger brother. Tej Pratap, however, evaded queries ion it.

He also said he had no plans to return to 10, Circular Road, the bungalow allotted to his mother in her capacity as a former Chief Minister in a clear hint that he was still upset with her over her not supporting his decision to divorce Aishwarya.

“I have requested the state government to allot a bungalow in my name. I have also tried to telephonically contact Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the issue,” he said.

Earlier this year, Tej Pratap Yadav had vacated the bungalow allotted to him while he was the health minister, claiming Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi had “released ghosts” inside the premises. Tejashwi, however, continues to occupy the bungalow allotted to him while he was the Deputy CM and is fighting a legal battle against efforts by the state government to get him evicted."

Taking a veiled dig at Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said people have started showing their gotra and sacred thread to become prominent in the country’s politics.

Addressing a gathering in the district Saturday he said, the people who had described themselves as accidentally Hindus were now realising that they were Hindus in the real sense and it was a victory of Sanatan faith.

He said Google failed before the epic Ramayana, which was written by sage Valmiki, and he asserted that the knowledge of the spiritual books was correct instead of what the search engine said.

“The word Kumbh has started becoming prevalent. It has become a fashion and trademark for the branding of one’s programme... These days people are showing their Gotra and janeyu (sacred thread) to become prominent in the country’s politics,” Adityanath said without naming Gandhi.

“The people who described themselves as accidentally Hindu are now realising that they are also Hindus. (They are realising) it is not accidental and we are Hindus in the real sense. Now they are remembering their janeyu and Gotra. I think this is the victory of India’s Sanatan faith. This is the victoy of our beliefs,” he said.

He claimed the people who were criticising the Kumbh Mela were trying to destroy the Indian culture and were conspiring to disgrace the country with the help of foreign funds.

The BJP leader claimed that they were trying to defame Hindu religion over the Sabrimala issue when everybody knew the tradition of the temple.

He claimed that those who had never been to temple were issuing statements over the issue and a similar environment was being created over the grand Kumbh Mela by terming it an anti-Dalit convention.

He said people from all castes took part in Kumbh which was a symbol of spiritual grandeur.

He said most verses in the Vedas were composed by Dalit saints and the sage who had interviewed Lord Ram was Valmiki but people from the community were discriminated against.

Updated: Dec 14, 2018 18:15 IST

In a sudden and swift development, Telangana Rashtra Samithi president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday anointed his son and Siricilla MLA K T Rama Rao as the working president of the party.

The development comes within three days of the TRS returning to power in the state and less than a day of KCR taking oath as the chief minister for a second successive term.

The appointment of KTR was announced hours before the executive committee meeting of the TRS held at Telangana Bhavan later in the afternoon. It is for the first time in the 14-year history of the TRS that the post of a working president has been created, as all these years, only KCR had been running the party single-handedly.

The move is believed to be the first step towards KCR handing over his baton to his son in the coming months, while he would focus on national politics. The chief minister is planning to step up his efforts to form a federal front of non-BJP, non-Congress regional parties before 2019 Lok Sabha election. He has announced that he would unveil his strategy for the national politics within a week.

KTR who attended the TRS executive committee meeting along with his father, was flooded with greetings from the party functionaries. Addressing the meeting, KCR said since he would be playing a bigger role in the national politics, his son would concentrate on the party activities in the state hereafter.

“From tomorrow, KTR will be available to you for all the party needs and he will dedicate his full time for the party and bring about a coordination between the party and the government,” he said.

The TRS chief called upon the party leaders to gear up to face the forthcoming general elections to Lok Sabha. “We shall appoint an in-charge for every Parliamentary constituency to oversee the electioneering of the party,” he said.

Political analyst and former Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said the development was a clear indication to the elevation of KTR as KCR’s successor in power as well.

“There is a possibility that KCR will contest the Lok Sabha elections and move to Delhi to focus on national politics, while anointing KTR as the next chief minister. I don’t think there will be any resistance to KTR becoming the chief minister. Nobody will even raise his voice, given the massive mandate the party had got in the recent assembly elections,” he said.

An official communique from CMO said in the morning that the chief minister took the decision to appoint KTR as working president, as the former would be focusing full time on bringing a qualitative change in national politics.

“At the same time, KCR has the responsibility to fulfil the election promises including completion of ongoing irrigation projects. So, he has decided to entrust the responsibility of running the party to his son KTR, who is his close confidant and the most efficient leader,” the statement said.

KTR has been entrusted with the responsibility of strengthening the party organization from the grassroots level by stepping up membership drive and construction of party offices at the district level.

“The chief minister is aiming at transforming the TRS into a powerful party in the entire country. And there is no better person than KTR, who successfully handled his role both in the party as well government till now, he has entrusted the responsibilities of the party to KTR, who is his trusted lieutenant,” he said.

Several TRS leaders congratulated KTR on his elevation as the party working president. KCR’s nephew T Harish Rao, who had hitherto been the right hand of KCR, also wished KTR all the best.

“Both of us worked together in the elections and we shall continue to work together. I will extend all possible support to him in all his future activities,” Harish Rao said after meeting KTR."

An upbeat Rajasthan Congress chief Sachin Pilot said the BJP tried to polarise voters to win the assembly elections, but the people of the state rejected its “ideas and attempts”. The 41-year-old former Union minister, a strong contender for the chief minister’s post, told Aurangzeb Naqshbandi that experts should not forget that the Congress has secured a clear majority. Edited excerpts:

Q: What are the factors that led to the Congress party’s victory?

A: The BJP’s policies and politics have been completely rejected and the people have chosen the Congress. Besides, the huge agrarian distress, unemployment, and economic slowdown—all those things had plagued the people’s lives and contributed to BJP’s defeat.

Q: You appear to be comfortably placed, but will you still approach the smaller parties for support?

A: The Congress has been clear that it will work with all those parties which are opposed to the BJP. The nation is far more important than anything else. We have got a clear mandate, but we still think that anti-BJP forces need to work together.

Watch: Rajasthan poll results: Ashok Gehlot or Sachin Pilot? Now race for CM’s post

Q: Two months ago, it seemed a one-way contest but in the end it turned out to be a neck-and-neck fight. How did the BJP manage to regain some of the lost ground?

A: Both the Central and state governments put in lot of money and used all the machinery and bureaucracy. (Uttar Pradesh chief minister)Yogi Adityanath addressed two dozen rallies with a single motive to polarise voters. They tried everything — religion, mandir-masjid — to polarise. The report card of Vasundhara-ji (outgoing chief minister Raje) showed a huge failure. Don’t forget that we started with 21 seats and now we have secured a clear majority. The BJP has lost almost 100 seats. Five years ago, they were at

165 seats.

Q: What will be the Congress government’s first priority?

A: Congress president Rahul Gandhi has clearly articulated that the first thing will be to remove the financial crisis that the farmers of Rajasthan are facing and also to create jobs for the unemployed. These are two pressing problems Rajasthan is facing.

Q: So, who is going to be the next chief minister of Rajasthan?

A: We’re meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. The central observer from Delhi, KC Venugopal, has come. The Congress party will take a call tomorrow as to who will head the next government. But for us, the important part was to defeat the BJP -- which we all have collectively been able to do."

Gautam Gambhir, who recently announced his retirement from all forms of cricket, has made it clear that he is not thinking about joining about politics as of now.

“You’ve been hard on yourself, so I don’t know if I’m going to be good at anything else or not, so politics is something which is a completely different field as well. Just because I tweet, just because I tweet on certain issues, doesn’t mean that I’m trying to get into politics as well,” Gambhir was as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.

“It is just because I tweet because I believe that as a citizen and as a taxpayer of this country I’ve got all the right to take up social issues because I strongly believe that what we have got to leave for our next generation is something which is our responsibility, and it is the responsibility of the current government or whichever government it is, whether it is Aam Aadmi Party or BJP or Congress, it is their responsibility to answer it back as well,” he further added.

Updated: Dec 09, 2018 21:12 IST

The just-retired Gautam Gambhir categorically rejected rumours around him joining politics but the former India opener indicated he was open to coaching at the big stage.

The 37-year-old World Cup winner walked into the sunset by scoring a memorable hundred in his farewell Ranji Trophy match against Andhra at the Feroz Shah Kotla.

“Not at all,” Gambhir said when asked if he was contesting in the next general elections.

“There are rumours which I have heard as well, probably the reason is maybe I take up social issues as well. For me Twitter was always a platform which is very, very important and where I take up social issues.

“I am not that kind of a character where I am going to start joking on a platform like twitter as well. For me being a citizen of this country it is my right to take up social issues and that probably is the reason why people think I am going to join politics but there is nothing of that sort.” Gambhir last played for the country in 2016 against England in Rajkot.

“As I just mentioned I haven’t even thought about it (politics) and it is a completely different field. In 25 years I have not done anything else, so let’s see what I am going to do.” Gambhir scored 4154 runs in 58 Tests, 5238 runs in ODIs and 932 in T20Is. He was also asked if he is keen on taking up coaching assignments in competitive cricket, and he sounded positive.

“One thing which excites me is action and I am sure action is not about sitting in those AC rooms doing commentary and stuff. I don’t know if I am going to be as good a coach as I have been a player,” Gambhir said.

“I will have to evaluate whether I can be successful as a coach. Let’s see, if that comes around and if I feel that I have the energy, passion and if I have the commitment to do it, I will think about it.”

He responded in the negative when asked if he will enter cricket administration at some point.

“I am too straightforward a person to be in administration, I don’t think people will accept me anywhere,” said Gambhir, who has distributed all his bats to his teammates, leaving his “kit bag empty”.

Gambhir said he is willing to help young players in Delhi cricket.

“I am still a government nominee, hopefully I can now try and contribute more now (since he is no longer a player). There won’t be any conflict of interest involved, which is very important and there won’t be any criticism as well because when I took this up there were a lot of criticism.

“The boys need a lot of good things in DDCA (Delhi District and Cricket Association) and hopefully I am able to put that word across the executive committee and get those things done from cricket point of view. Apart from that, my job is to get the best out of the boys.”"

Updated: Dec 06, 2018 14:26 IST

A game of one-upmanship between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has left a badminton court, built in Bibvewadi by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) by spending Rs 2 crore, lying unused for the past one year.

It was Asmita Shinde, the then MNS corporator, who took the lead to set up the sports complex, that took three years to build, and was inaugurated by her party chief Raj Thackeray in November 2016. The PMC-built multipurpose sports complex Shakuntala Shinde Krida Sankul was built at the open space of Yashwantrao Chavan middle school at Bibvewadi. The school is run by the municipal corporation.

As it was election year, the then municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar under his powers gave permission to operate the sports complex and gave the badminton hall to private contractor on leave and licence basis for a year.

As it is a civic project, PMC has to float a tender for giving out the badminton hall to a contractor and it has to be cleared by PMC standing committee. Kumar had exercised his powers to do away with this process because of polls.

However, after the one-year contract period, the BJP-led civic administration has not put the hall into use with residents claiming that the abandoned sports complex is used by anti-social elements.

Kishori Shinde, PMC sports officer, said, “It is true that the sports complex is lying idle. The PMC school board has transferred the hall to us. We have completed the tender process and forwarded the proposal to PMC standing committee. After getting the committee’s nod, the civic administration will reopen the sports complex.”

Yogesh Mulik, PMC standing committee chairman, said that the standing committee will discuss the court reopening issue at the meeting scheduled next week. “We will try and resolve the issue in that meeting,” said Mulik.

Former corporator Shinde said, “I lost the polls in 2017. The sports complex was built as per international standards and many national level players were using the facility and the sports complex was also appreciated and used by residents. However, instead of keeping the sports complex open, BJP elected members ensured to seal the facility stating that it was in operating without carrying the tender process.”

MNS leader Vishal Shinde said, “After the 2017 polls, the sports complex was handed over to the PMC school board and now tenders have been floated for it. The proposal is lying pending before the standing committee for the last one month.”

Shinde said that as per the proposal the sports complex would be used by students for free during school time and the contractor will utilise it before and after school time.

As per the proposal, the PMC plans to rent out the sports complex for three years and one of the contractors has offered Rs 4.30 lakh annual rent to PMC for running the complex. Seven parties have participated in the tender process.

“There are a few stadiums constructed by PMC, but as far as Poona District Metropolitan Badminton Association (PDMBA) is concerned we have no idea about this complex. If it is closed since last one year, then it should start at the earliest,” said Ranjeet Natu, PDMBA honorary secretary.

Facility is the symbol of civic neglect

Asmita Shinde, former MNS corporator, took the initiative to build the sports complex Shakuntala Shinde Krida Sankul and it inaugurated by her party chief Raj Thackeray in November 2016.

Then municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar under his powers gave permission to operate the sports complex to a private contractor on leave and licence basis for one year.

Shinde lost in 2017 polls and BJP public representatives did not use the complex after one year stating that it was operating without carrying the tender process.

Kishori Shinde, PMC sports officer, said that civic administration will reopen the sports complex after PMC standing committee clears the tendering proposal."

Updated: Dec 04, 2018 16:13 IST

In December and January, politics in Bengal is all set to revolve around Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) rath yatra, styled as Ganatantra Bachao Yatra (Rally to Save Democracy), as all its opponents have lined up programmes to counter what has been dubbed as the most spectacular political programme of the saffron camp in Bengal.

In December, three air-conditioned buses decorated with political messages and fitted with hydraulic lifts will start from three corners of the state and travel through all of 294 Assembly segments of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats.

During the course of about 40-day campaign, top leaders of the party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah, union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and Smriti Irani and chief ministers Yogi Adityanath and Sarbananda Sonwal will address 42 rallies.

The opponents have also readied their ammunition.

A group of Dalit, tribal and Muslim organisations under the umbrella banner of Sangbidhan Bachao Samiti (Platform to Save the Constitution), has started a rally that will cover all districts of south Bengal by December 6, when a public meeting will be held in Kolkata on the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri mosque.

“Our Samhati Jatra started from South 24-Parganas district on November 26 and reached Nadia, after covering North 24 Parganas, on November 30. After covering Birbhum, Burdwan, Purulia, Bankura, Jhargram, West Midnapore, East Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly, the tableau will reach Kolkata on the night of January 5. The central theme of our rally is to make people aware of BJP’s divisive politics ahead of their rath yatra,” said Saradindu Uddipan, state convenor of Sangbidhan Bachao Samiti.

The Samiti comprises Bharat Jakat Majhi Mandwa, Majhi Pargana Mahal, Jai Bhim Network (tribal bodies), West Bengal Minority Youth Federation, Jamaat e Islami Hind, a faction of Adivasi Bikash Parishad and some other organisations. These socio-cultural and religious organisations have largely remained politically neutral and work as pressure groups.

Two other rallies are being undertaken by two groups composed of Left-leaning activists. One, taken out by Young Bengal, started from Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas on November 25 and ended at Dumdum in North 24-Parganas on December 1, after passing through Kolkata. The other, a bicycle rally titled ‘Tomar Danga Tomar Ram, Amar Bukey Kshudiram’ (You have riots and Ram, I have Kshudiram), started on December 3 (revolutionary Kshudiram Bose’s birthday) and will culminate in Kolkata on December 6 after passing through the industrial belts in North 24 -Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah districts.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Congress have both dared the Trinamool Congress government to show its commitment for secularism by stopping BJP’s yatra.

“If she has Lalu Prasad Yadav’s courage, she should stop BJP’s chariot of hatred. We can’t see any intention yet,” said CPI(M) state secretary Surya Kanta Mishra, referring to the former Bihar chief minister’s instance of stopping Lal Krishna Advani-led rath yatra in 1990.

The CPI(M) has lined up a series of events during December and January and counter BJP’s propaganda. Its leaders addressed public meetings in Cooch Behar on December 1 and 2 , five days before BJP’s first bus is expected to start from the north Bengal town. CPI(M) also held a rally at Sagar in South 24-Parganas district on December 4, five days before BJP’s second bus is scheduled to start from there. Another rally will be held at Dubrajpur in Birbhum district on December 10, four days before Amit Shah will flag off the third bus from the temple town of Tarapith.

Ruling Trinamool Congress, on the other hand, has decided to organise a rally on the same route through which BJP’s raths will pass in each district. She has dubbed these rallies as ‘purification drive’.

“These are no chariots. These are travelling five-star hotels. We will purify every path BJP’s raths will pollute,” Banerjee announced last week.

The Congress, while organising street-corner meetings in different districts, will hold a public gathering in Kolkata on December 12, state Congress chief Somen Mitra said.

BJP’s Bengal leadership said they are happy to see all activities revolving around their programme. “It’s good to see we are setting the tone and content of the discourse,” remarked BJP state president Dilip Ghosh."

Updated: Nov 29, 2018 09:09 IST

The Congress and the BJP’s battle for Amethi is being fought on the social media ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and ‘gotra’ politics has added a new dimension to it.

Amethi is the Lok Sabha constituency of Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

The social media was abuzz after a priest revealed Gandhi’s ‘gotra’ and declared that he was a Kashmiri Brahmin during his (Gandhi’s) visit to a temple in Pushkar. And now, union minister for textiles Smriti Irani’s ‘gotra’ too has become a point of discussion in cyber space.

“Are you nuts??? I HAVE A GOTRA. BOTH PARENTS ARE HINDU. Father’s gotra - Kaushal. Mother’s gotra - Shandilya. Since father’s gotra Kaushal so is mine. Get a life,” said Irani in response to a question on Twitter. Irani, who had taken on Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha polls in Amethi in 2014, was asked “May I have the privilege to ask the gotra of @smritiirani ji, her husband and kids? The sindoor she wears is religious or style statement?”

Irani also posted a public disclaimer saying she had responded to the question as a public figure and India was her religion. “As a public figure when asked questions (no matter how infuriating) it is my responsibility to respond however as an Indian let me proudly say -mera dharma Hindustan hai, mera karm Hindustan hai, meri aastha Hindustan hai, mera vishwas Hindustan hai.”

“Irani disclosed her ‘gotra’ only when someone asked her about it. The Congress is out to project Rahul Gandhi as a Brahmin. More questions are now bound to be raised on the issue,” said Amethi BJP leader Uma Shankar Pandey.

Congress leaders in Amethi have questioned Irani for declaring her ‘gotra’ on social media. “Smriti Irani wants to remain in focus. Why does she need to declare her ‘gotra’ on the social media? The BJP has put her in the forefront in Amethi to get attention. No one in Amethi takes her seriously now. So, she is resorting to social media,” said Congress MLC from Amethi Deepak Singh.

A poster declaring Rahul Gandhi a ‘Shiv bhakt’ had caught attention on social media earlier.

Both the Congress and the BJP have been indulging in a war of words on various issues. Irani’s move to send a gift 10,000 saris to Amethi too had caught attention recently.

The Congress leaders had claimed that Irani and the BJP had not done anything Are you nuts??? I HAVE A GOTRA. BOTH PARENTS ARE HINDU. Father’s gotra ­ Kaushal. Mother’s gotra ­ Shandilya. Since father’s gotra Kaushal so is mine. Get a life SMRITI IRANI, Union textile minister for the people of Amethi in the past four and a half years and that was why she was trying to keep her party workers in good humour. But the BJP had called the saris a Diwali gift.

The Congress leaders had said her decision to send the Diwali gift was politically motivated about six months before the next year’s Lok Sabha elections. She did not send such a gift in 2017, they said."

Updated: Nov 26, 2018 17:19 IST

Former joint director of Central Bureau of Investigation V V Lakshminarayana, who took voluntary retirement this March, announced his entry into politics on Monday.

The 53-year old Andhra IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre joined Lok Satta, a political party founded by retired IAS officer and former legislator Dr Jayaprakash Narayan, at a meeting held at Indira Priyadarshini auditorium in Hyderabad.

Lakshminarayana will be reviving the party that had gone defunct four years ago after Jayaprakash Narayan wound it up as a political force and has been running it as a social organisation. He declared that the party would contest the next assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh.

Lakshminarayana made it to the headlines while investigating several high profile cases, including the infamous Satyam Computers accounting fraud involving its chairman B Ramalinga Raju, Obulapuram iron ore mining scam involving former Karnataka minister Gali Janardhan Reddy, Emaar-MGF scam in Hyderabad and most importantly the quid pro quo case involving YSR Congress party president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy.

Ever since he took the voluntary retirement, Lakshminarayana has been indicating that he would enter politics to serve the people. He said he had received an invitation from Aam Admi Party and another national party but had not taken any decision.

He hinted that he might float a new political party but finally chose to join Lok Satta which he said was closer to his heart and was working for rural development and local self-governance.

Accusing Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath of seeking votes on religious grounds, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday urged the Election Commission to take action against him.

The party also accused him of hatching a “criminal conspiracy against free and fair polls”. In its complaint, the BJP referred to a video in which Kamal Nath is allegedly asking a group of Muslims to ensure that the Congress gets 90% of votes in their booths.

BJP vice-president Prabhat Jha who was among those who met the Madhya Pradesh’s Chief Election Officer with the complaint. Jha added that he would also lodge a report with the police asking them to arrest Nath.

Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta defended Kamal Nath’s statement. “He was addressing Muslims so he asked them to vote in large numbers. What is wrong in that?... If the BJP is accusing us of minority appeasement, why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi visit a masjid in Indore, and why are they talking about developing madarsas...”

The state Chief Election Officer V Kantharao said he has received the complaint against Kamal Nath. “We have made a report and sent it to Election Commission of India,” he added"

Hours after she announced that she won’t be contesting the next Lok Sabha elections due to her health, Foreign Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj took to Twitter to reassure people that though she may not be contesting the elections, she is not retiring from politics.

Sushma, who represents Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha in Parliament, had announced her decision in Indore yesterday where she had gone to canvass for the Assembly elections currently underway.

Soon after Sushma’s announcement, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta had come out in her support on Twitter. “Retiring from electoral politics on account of health issues doesn’t imply she is retiring from politics altogether. There is a great deal of contribution she can make to public life despite not being in the Lok Sabha,” he tweeted.

Appreciating his comment, Sushma tweeted, “You are right, Swapan. I am not retiring from politics. It is just that I am not contesting the next Lok Sabha election due to my health issues.”

Sushma has been suffering from diabetes and had undergone a kidney transplant in December 2016.

Congress’s MP from Thiruvananthapuram Shashi Tharoor, who is known for his Twitter diplomacy, also tweeted his admiration for the veteran BJP leader.

“For all our political differences, I am sorry that Sushma Swaraj will leave Parliament. As chair of the jury for Outlook India’s social media awards, I was happy to honour her Twiplomacy. As chair of Parliament’s ExtAffsCmt I always found her a gracious EAM,” Tharoor tweeted.

Sushma, gracious in her reply to Tharoor, wrote, “Thanks for your kind words, Shashi. I wish we both continue in our respective positions.”

Former finance minister P Chidambaram too praised Sushma’s decision and wished her good health and a long life.

“Smt Sushma Swaraj is the Member of Parliament from Madhya Pradesh and she is smart. She has read the writing on the wall in Madhya Pradesh and announced that she will not contest the 2019 LS election. Braving illness, Smt Sushma Swaraj has served the country with great dignity. We wish Smt Sushma Swaraj good health and a long life,” he tweeted."

From manifesto promises to build cow shelters and starting commercial production of cow urine; to statue inaugurations and chief ministers busy making headlines for changing city names rather than changing policy, the political rhetoric this election season is a sad reminder of one of the greatest empirical puzzles of India’s democracy. Why has a democracy, as deeply entrenched and competitive as ours, where the poor vote in far greater numbers than the rich, failed to produce a politics of accountability for the delivery of public goods and services? In other words, why do elections routinely fail in generating meaningful debate on the quality of public services and election results rarely an evaluation of policies and manifesto promises?

This is not to suggest that Indian democracy has failed to produce a politics of welfare. Far from it. In fact I would go so far as to say that welfare schemes are a site of serious political competition. This is best evidenced in the Modi government’s approach to welfare. For all its initial rhetoric on jobs and aspirations, this government has invested significant political capital to take the welfare mantle away from its predecessor, the UPA, by consistently launching grandiose new schemes and renaming old ones — so much so that many, including this newspaper, have argued that the 2019 election is likely to be a welfarist or populist election, focused on the delivery of goods and services and other benefits.

The problem is that this politics of welfare remains restricted to a politics of launching schemes and promises of future hand-outs rather than of undertaking systemic reforms to ensure effective delivery. Lack of political will is a standard trope trotted out in almost every popular and academic debate on the quality of public services in India. The problem, as political scientists Devesh Kapur and Aditya Dasgupta have argued, lies in the fact that while the electoral returns to announcing new schemes are clear, the returns on investments in strengthening state institutions to ensure schemes are implemented well are far more diffused. This is why even ostensibly simple investments, such as staffing India’s chronically under resourced local administration, are rarely a political priority.

The problem of incentives is compounded by the fact that the nature of reforms needed to improve public services and meet voter aspirations is increasingly more complex. Improving education, for instance, is no longer about building a school. Rather it is about creating institutional systems that improve learning quality. This is a complex reform for which there are no clear pathways or short term quick fixes and thus no immediate political gains.

In the absence of incentives to invest in implementation, during elections, the politics of welfare is inevitably reduced to a political competition for populist hand-outs and cash. This is what political scientists have termed “vote buying”.

Why do voters respond to vote buying strategies? And what will it take to shift the needle toward a more robust politics of welfare implementation in India? These are questions that political scientists have long puzzled over. A recent paper by Oliver Heath and Louise Tillin, based on a survey of voters in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, offers some important insights relevant for the season’s elections.

Chhattisgarh, under Raman Singh, as has been widely documented, undertook serious institutional reforms to substantially improve the delivery of the public distribution system and the MGNREGA. These reforms were crucial to the Raman Singh government’s bid for political legitimacy and managing the social costs associated with opening the state to the extractives industry. Madhya Pradesh (MP), on the other hand, under Shivraj Singh Chouhan, adopted an agriculture-focused rather than welfare-led reform agenda.

Exploiting these differences, Heath and Tillin ran an experimental survey to understand voter choices. They found that voters residing in the relatively better functioning institutional context of Chhattisgarh were less responsive to small-scale “vote-buying” strategies compared to their neighbours in MP. These differences blurred as the size of the hand-out increased (from food to jobs) but the fact that voters were making different choices in Chhattisgarh holds important lessons. Voters are susceptible (likely to vote in favour of) to “buying” tactics when institutions are weak and voter confidence in the ability of governments’ to deliver public goods is low. Quite frankly, this is only rational.

Ironically, the only way to break this cycle, as Chhattisgarh’s voters indicate, is if politicians are willing to invest in institutional reforms. Sadly, if the current election rhetoric is anything to go by, our politicians, even those in Chhattisgarh, who have the opportunity to build on their own success, have failed to recognise the potential for change. The 2019 polls will be fought in the grammar of populist vote-buying and dangerous communalisation. But can we wish for a different election in 2024?

Updated: Nov 13, 2018 15:59 IST

Maharashtra’s longest-serving assembly member, Ganpatrao Deshmukh, 92, has decided to bring his enviable record to a close by not contesting the next elections. Deshmukh, an MLA for 59 years was first elected as a lawmaker in 1962.

An 11-term Marxist Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) legislator from Solapur district’s Sangola, said he would not contest the Maharashtra elections due next year because of his age. “It is time I take the break as I cannot (even) read or write due to low vision,” said Deshmukh, who is one of the three PWP members in the Maharashtra assembly. Deshmukh is the second longest-serving lawmaker in the country after late Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader and former Tamil Nadu chief minister M Karunanidhi, whose electoral career spanned 61 years. Karunanidhi served as a MLA 13 times without a break. Deshmukh has contested 13 elections and lost twice in 1995 and 1972.

In 1995, he lost by a margin of just 192 votes. In the last elections in 2014, he defeated Congress’ Shahaji Bapu Patil by over 25,000 votes. Deshmukh has mostly been in the opposition. He first became a minister in Sharad Pawar’s Progressive Democratic Front government in 1978. Deshmukh joined the Maharashtra government for the second time in 1999, when the PWP supported the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance.

“As I was mostly in the opposition, I had to struggle to get various government projects in my constituency, where water scarcity is a major issue,” said Deshmukh, who is credited with the Tembhu irrigation project, which has helped irrigate over 50,000 acres of land in Sangola. Deshmukh’s electoral success has been attributed to the support he enjoys among farmers in his constituency.

“Such was the firm support that Deshmukh did not need to campaign much during the elections,’’ said Kishore Kulkarni, a local political observer.

He had declared assets worth Rs 2.2 crore during the last elections.

“Since I could not bear the expense of campaigning... my supporters collected donations ,” said Deshmukh, an arts and law graduate."

Updated: Nov 19, 2018 17:00 IST

Elphinstone Road to Prabhadevi, Colaba Causeway to Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, Victoria Terminus to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Bombay to Mumbai — 71 years after independence, Mumbai’s colonial past is still at the heart of its politics. In 2018, the renaming of the city’s roads, buildings, junctions and monuments was the second-most discussed issue in the civic body, according to a report by the Praja Foundation.

Why do away with colonial names for legacy structures so many years later, what goes into the renaming, and, will old Mumbaiites ever use the new names?

The patron goddess of the local Koli community, Mumbadevi, took centrestage in the city’s politics in 1995, the year Bombay became Mumbai. The Shiv Sena, the party in power that year, pushed for the change to champion the cause of the Marathi-speaking “sons of the soil”. Today, the renaming of cities is back to being a top agenda for politicians, with the Sena pushing to change the names of two Maharashtrian cities — Aurangabad and Osmanabad — after cities in Uttar Pradesh were renamed.

But, what does it mean for a diverse city like Mumbai? It’s part of the city’s natural evolution, said Tasneem Mehta, trustee of the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, known till 1975 as the Victoria and Albert Museum. “The museum is about India and Indian traditions,” said Mehta. “Bhau Daji Lad was instrumental in setting it up, he raised the funds, he did the research. I think it’s a very appropriate choice.”

Mehta, however, added that a name change doesn’t mean the history is lost. “The history will always be there, but perhaps, it has greater relevance to the community now.”

There are others who believe renaming public spaces goes hand in hand with the politics of statue removals, which first gained momentum during the Samyukta Maharashtra movement of the 1950s and 1960s — and again over the past few years. It was the Samiti that had demanded the creation of a separate Marathi-speaking state from the State of Bombay — which at the time covered both Maharashtra and Gujarat.

“After the statue of Queen Victoria was removed from the Victoria Terminus [now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus], no one knows where it was taken,” said Aadil Desai, a member of the Bombay Local History Society (BLHS). “The statue of the prince of Wales that was at Kala Ghoda was moved to Rani Baug.” Incidentally, Rani Baug was originally called Victoria Garden. Its name was changed to Jijamata Udyan, after Shivaji’s mother Jijabai – a reminder of how the Maratha king still serves as a potent symbol of Marathi identity.

In some cases, the new Indian names have nothing to do with the monument or its origins. For instance, the Prince of Wales Museum was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. “Since we are doing away with colonial names, Prince of Wales had to go. But a simple name such as ‘Museum of Western India’ would have better defined the architecture and scope of the museum,” a city historian pointed out.

Meanwhile, there is an emerging voice amongst Mumbaiites who believe the name-changes remain on paper.

“The old name is the old name. A true Bombay man will die saying Altamount Road (even though it was renamed SK Barodawallah Marg almost three decades ago),” said city historian Deepak Rao. “If you tell a taxi-wallah to go to Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, he will not understand.” What is today Shahid Bhagat Singh Road was actually four areas in south Mumbai — Colaba Road, Colaba Causeway, Custom House Road, and Mint Road, Rao explained.

Then, there are those concerned about the logistic challenges the name changes pose. “Many street names are important, not only because they represent the local history of the area, but also for navigation,” said Pankaj Joshi, president, Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI). “This especially happens with the renaming of chowks. So, if you are travelling by a BEST bus, you may end up going to Colaba while you’re looking for something in Byculla.”

Joshi said to do away with this confusion, there was a suggestion in the heritage committee several years ago to keep the new name but also mention the old name in brackets. “That way, you have the historical reference and people won’t get confused, at least for a few years.”

The zeal to Indianise localities and roads has also left in its trail some faux pas.

“When a name change is proposed by an elected representative in the civic body, it is referred to the respective ward officers. The ward officers are responsible for inspecting the area and ensuring the new name falls in line with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s norms,” said a senior civic official. “One of these norms is that the name of a road cannot be changed if it is an Indian name.”

There is a renewed interest in naming streets and railway stations after the 19th century social reformer Jagannath (Nana) Shankarshet, said Desai of the BLHS. “Gunbow Street, renamed Rustom Sidhwa Marg, was a name given by the British to honour an Indian, Ganba Shet, one of Nana Shankarshet’s ancestors. Gunbow was a corrupted form of Ganba,” Desai said. “But Gunbow Street was renamed Rustom Sidhwa Marg as it was assumed to be a colonial name!”"

Updated: Nov 09, 2018 07:35 IST

Kerala police booked Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state president PS Sreedharan Pillai for his speech claiming credit for the Sabarimala agitation, on a day his party launched a rath yatra (chariot campaign) to protect the Lord Ayyappa temple’s traditions and rituals and the Congress announced rallies covering the entire state.

The case was registered in Kozhikode on Thursday on a complaint by journalist Shybin alleging that Pillai had recently instigated activists to protest against the entry of women of child-bearing age into the hill shrine, police said. Reacting to this, Pillai accused the CPI(M) and the Congress of ‘witch hunting’ and trying to ‘tarnish’ his image.

On September 29, the Supreme Court had allowed entry of all women into the temple, triggering protests by various groups that kept them out on October 17 when the doors were thrown open. Addressing youth leaders later, Pillai had claimed that the protests were planned and executed by his party.

On Thursday, within hours of former Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddyurappa flagging off the rath yatra aimed at expanding the BJP influence in the state before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, stones were pelted in Payyanur in the evening. Immediately, the BJP called for a statewide protest on Friday. Pillai and Tushar Vellapally, leader of Bharath Dharma Jana Sena, an ally of the NDA in Kerala, are leading the ‘Sabarimala Samrakshana Rath Yatra’. The Congress too announced five rallies across the state. Five senior leaders, including K Sudhakaran and K Muralidharan, will be leading the rallies.

On Thursday, the Kerala high court rejected the bail application of Kochi resident Govind Madhusudhan, arrested in connection with the Sabarimala protests. “The protests at Sabarimala are not acceptable as it is against the verdict of the Supreme Court,” the court said. “If the bail application is considered, it will send wrong signals and similar incidents will recur.”

Police have arrested at least 3,700 people in connection with the violence."

Chief Election Commissioner O P Rawat on Wednesday said that the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on decriminalisation of politics would be strictly observed and candidates have to clearly mention the stages of criminal cases against them in their affidavits.

The candidates’ affidavits would be immediately uploaded on the Election Commission’s website, the CEC told reporters while referring to the apex court order in September.

Mizoram and four other states are going to polls over the next two months. The CEC was in Mizoram with two Election Commissioners- Sunil Arora and Ashok Lavasa - and four senior officials to review the poll preparedness for the November 28 assembly election.

The Supreme Court had said on September 25 that criminalisation of politics strikes at the very root of democracy by making the citizenry suffer at the hands of those “who are nothing but a liability” to the country.

In a 100-page verdict, the court had left it to Parliament to make a law to ensure that persons facing serious criminal cases do not enter the political stream.

“The Election Commission would ensure strict observance of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on decriminalisation of politics and the candidates should clearly mention the stages of criminal cases against them in the affidavits which would be immediately uploaded in the election commission website,” Rawat said. In Mizoram, at least 80 flying squads would keep a close vigil on the candidates to ensure that no cash, liquor or drugs are used in the hustings and the expenditure monitoring would include utilisation of GPS to monitor movements of suspected parties, he said.

The EC team under CEC on Tuesday interacted with representatives of different political parties and also people from administration as well civil society as part of preparation for the one day voting to 40-member Mizoram assembly on November 28.

A close watch would be kept on bank accounts of candidates to detect suspicious transactions, the CEC said.

The CEC was not categorical on questions whether Bru voters in the relief camps would exercise franchise in Mizoram as committed by the Election Commission on April 7, 2014.

“Certain decisions have to be made in view of fresh developments after free ration and cash dole were stopped by the Centre in the relief camps,” Rawat said.

He said that the Election Commission has been assessing the situation closely.

The NGO Coordination Committee, a conglomeration of three major NGOs and two student bodies, had on Tuesday urged the EC to defranchise all the Bru voters who chose to stay back in Tripura and did not return to Mizoram.

Only 40 of the 5,407 Bru refugee families returned to Mizoram from the six refugee camps in Tripura during the stipulated one month of repatriation process that ended on September 30.

The CEC said that preparations for free, fair, peaceful and smooth polls to the 40-member Mizoram legislature on November 28 were on.

Arrangements were being made to ensure exercise of franchise by all, including persons with disabilities.

He said that the state government has been instructed to ensure availability of drinking water, toilet and electricity in all polling stations while ramps should also be made for persons with disabilities.

At least one polling station, manned only by women election and security officials, would be established, Rawat said."

What is there in a name? ‘A lot’ will be the answer of state’s politicians who have indulged in the politics of name-change over the years in Uttar Pradesh.

About a year after renaming Ardh Kumbh as Kumbh and Kumbh as the Maha Kumbh, the state cabinet on Tuesday named Allahabad as Prayagraj.

As demands for more such changes are being made in different parts of the state the renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj may just be the beginning of more such changes in the coming days in the state.

The Yogi government has already named Mughalsarai city and railway junction after the name of BJP ideologue Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay. A demand to rename Faizabad as Saket is already being made. There has been a demand to change name of Aligarh as Harigarh. BJP leaders in Aligarh have been seen riding on vehicles having Harigarh written on them. Bihar governor Lalji Tandon in his book ‘An Kaha Lucknow’ has said the original name of Lucknow was Lakhanpuri. So, the demand to rename Lucknow is bound to find support in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP.

“Names that are symbols of Gulami (slavery) should be changed with the names of patriots,” said Prabhu Narain, the Awadh Prant Sanghchalak of the RSS.

Will the state government consider more such changes? “As of now the state cabinet has decided to rename Allahabad as Prayagraj,” said minister for medical and health Siddharth Nath Singh, who had taken up the demand of renaming Allahabad as Prayagraj at various levels. Singh had written letters to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and governor Ram Naik as well on the issue.

Yogi Adityanath government had also changed names of many projects/schemes after its installation in March 2017. It had dropped prefix ‘Samajwadi’ from the Purvanchal Expressway project of Akhilesh Yadav government. Despite UPA government’s objections the SP government had named the ambulance service as the Samajwadi Ambulance Swasthya Sewa. Besides dropping the prefix ‘Samajwadi’ from the ambulance service, the BJP government replaced ‘Samajwadi’ with ‘Mukhya Mantri’ in the government’s pension scheme.

This is however not for the first time that changes have been made in the name of a city, institution or scheme in the state. In the last two decades, successive state governments have been indulging in changing names of institutions, schemes, projects and districts.

The Samajwadi Party government had decided to reverse a number of BSP government’s decisions on change of names. The SP government decided to restore the name of the state’s prestigious medical university as King George’s Medical University that Mayawati government had renamed as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University. Eight districts that the Mayawati government had named after BSP ideologues were also given their original names."

Updated: Oct 17, 2018 22:28 IST

Inflation is back on the economic agenda. The annual growth in wholesale price index (WPI) in the quarter ending September 2018 was 4.98%.

This is the highest since September 2014, which was the first full quarter after the current government assumed office. To be sure, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew at 3.88% in this period, after having grown at more than 4% in the last three quarters.

Both CPI and WPI have been rising

The political context is important here. Inflation was rising at a fast pace — CPI was growing in double digits — before the 2014 general elections. The current trajectory of crude oil prices and rupee’s exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar, both of which affect inflation, is also similar to the pre-2014 trajectory.

However, there is one key difference in the rising inflation under the present government and its predecessor.

Rising inflation under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) II came on the back of high food prices; this has not been the case under the present government. Chart 2 shows the annual growth in food and non-food component of the CPI and the primary food articles component of the WPI.

Until March 2014, both CPI-Food and WPI-primary food article components were growing at a faster pace than the non-food component of the CPI.

The WPI-primary food component is a useful proxy for growth in prices received by the farmers, as they sell their output in wholesale, not retail markets.

Its growth has been falling at a faster pace than that of the CPI-food component in the recent period.

UPA II inflation was driven by food prices

This trend has important political economy implications. A relatively slower growth in food prices, especially in farm products means a worsening of terms of trade for farmers.

This corroborates the narrative of rural distress under the present government.

But it also means that net buyers of food grains, even if they are not so well-off, are not hit hard by inflation. Exorbitant prices of pulses and vegetables were an important part of the economic narrative in the last phase of the UPA-II government. This is not the case right now.

These trends can have political implications.

Successive rounds of the Mood of the Nation survey conducted by Delhi based Centre for the Study of Developing Societies-Lokniti show a marked difference in changing levels of support for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in villages and big cities.

Support for the NDA went down by nine percentage points between May 2017 and May 2018 in villages, while it increased by two percentage points in the big cities. Things could have been different had the urban poor been hit hard by rising food prices.

BJP has bigger support in cities

So, is keeping food inflation in control a political masterstroke by the present government? Another set of statistics could help put this question in context. A 2014 paper by Rahul Verma and Sanjay Kumar compared the gains in BJP’s vote share and seats in rural, semi-urban and urban areas between the 2009 and 2014 elections. The biggest increase in vote share for the BJP was in urban areas, where it increased by more than 14 percentage points, almost two percentage points more than the increase in rural areas.

Keeping food prices low may benefit the BJP as far as urban seats are concerned.

But it’s worth remembering that the BJP won almost five times more seats in rural areas in 2014 than the urban areas. This is because rural India has six times more Lok Sabha seats than urban India. This explains why rural distress matters in Indian politics."

The Supreme Court has declined to ban politicians with criminal cases from contesting elections but underlined that it is time Parliament enacts laws to ensure that people with criminal cases do not enter politics.

Society has a right to be governed by better people, the judges said while observing that politicians with criminal cases must be “kept at bay”.

Such a law should be enacted as soon as possible, it said.

“The sooner the better, before it becomes fatal to democracy,” a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said.

Nearly 1,700 MPs and MLAs, a little over a third of all elected representatives in India, face criminal charges.

Under the existing law, politicians are banned from contesting elections for six years only if they are convicted for the crime. Also, there is nothing to stop convicted politicians from heading political parties.

A bunch of petitions filed before the Supreme Court had argued that this should change.

The judges ruled that the court was not in a position to add a disqualification to bar people with criminal cases from entering politics or contesting elections. So it cannot declare that legislators who have been charged of serious offences should be disqualified.

But the court lamented the state of affairs.

“Our Indian democracy has seen a steady increase in the level of criminalization creeping into Indian polity. This tends to disrupt constitutional ethos, strikes at the root of democratic form of government and makes citizens suffer,” the judges said.

During arguments in the case, the centre’s top law officer KK Venugopal had opposed suggestions that the top court could assume the power to make laws that was the prerogative of the legislature.

The bench had then countered him, saying it understood the concept of separation of powers and could not direct Parliament to make a law, but the “question is what can we do to contain the rot”."

Updated: Sep 18, 2018 09:10 IST

After playing Kabaddi for over 24 years and earning fame in the state, 42-year-old Kabaddi star Soma Singh Gharachon, who failed to get a government job and spent his life in poverty, is all set to contest the Zila Parishad elections from Basiarak zone in Sangrur district.

Hailing from a poor Dalit family, Gharachon, along with his six brothers, used to play Kabaddi since his school days. He had even formed a team from Gharachon village, which is his native. In 1999, Soma and two of his brothers had played against Pakistan and won a tough match at Dirba.

While seven Gharachon brothers chose Kabaddi, the eighth one, Ajmer Gharachon, became a Punjabi lyricist.

A contemporary of late Harjit Brar Bajakhana, Soma has passed Class 12 and had played in school games and open matches across country. The family spent their entire life in poverty as all the siblings failed to secure any government job or get any other financial assistance.

“I had won many matches. I have faced financial distress, but despite that, I have managed to earn love and respect in the area. Forgetting that I was ignored by successive governments, I want to contest these elections to serve the people of my area,” said Soma, who gives Kabaddi coaching to budding players.

Soma claimed that before filing the nomination papers, he was offered by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress to contest from reserve seat for SCs, and ultimately he decided to contest as a SAD candidate.

Congress has fielded Jeet Singh against him and Gurlal Singh is contesting on AAP’s ticket. “I had contested the sarpanch election last time, but lost with a few hundred votes. Now, I have decided to try my luck in the Zila Parishad polls,” Soma said.

“I have no property or business. I cannot even offer a cup of tea to my voters,” he added. Previously, another Kabaddi player Gulzar Singh had contested unsuccessfully on SAD ticket in the state assembly elections."

Updated: Aug 30, 2018 00:09 IST

The legendary Kapoor family of Hindi cinema, whose four generations have not only acted but contributed to shaping and nurturing the industry, has decided to sell the iconic RK Studio in Chembur, according to reports this week. The process of negotiation has apparently begun. It could take months or years, but what is certain is the family’s resolve to sell the space, though with “a heavy heart”, as actor Rishi Kapoor told a tabloid.

There is nothing overtly political about the act of selling off a piece of legacy. Such decisions tend to be personal and circumstantial, sometimes purely commercial. The Kapoor family, by all reckoning, are an emotional lot, bonded by their shared heritage and place in the film industry, and unlikely to have made the decision only on commercial basis. How the renowned actor-filmmaker, the late Raj Kapoor, might have reacted is anybody’s guess. Yet, it is political in a way.

RK Studio symbolises something uniquely urban: A personal space of great public, historic or heritage value but which is neither cared for by the industry or the city. This isn’t the first nor will it be the last. The hostel and printing press set up by Dr BR Ambedkar were razed. Textile mills were replaced by malls and offices, and other film studios by gleaming towers.

Work spaces and homes of famous personalities, spaces steeped in historical value which speak to present generations, are a living heritage of Mumbai. They deserve more than what the Mumbai administrators have offered so far, focussed as they have been on built architectural heritage that too largely in the southern tip.

Despite the city being the de facto headquarters of Hindi cinema and a hub for alternative cinema, it got a film museum only four years ago. Could RK Studio have been turned into a memorial to the one of the greatest showman of the business in a way that preserved its essence but also allowed his descendants commercial returns? Could the city, the industry, and Kapoor family have partnered to create something new? Could this model have been replicated for other similar sites?

In the decline and imminent sale of the once sought-after studio lie many stories about Mumbai: The spatial shift of the cinema industry itself away from Chembur to the western parts of Andheri and Goregaon, the inescapable perennial traffic congestion which makes the commute to Chembur and back tedious for many, the availability of modern state-of-the-art studios, the speculative but dizzying prices of real estate, the premium on redevelopment of old and iconic properties. Also, it symbolises a city impatient with its past, making invisible certain aspects of itself.

Ironically, this is at a time when the leisure industry, including Bollywood, has expanded. The industry celebrates Ranbir Kapoor, but contributes little to maintain his grandfather’s heritage. This is also a time when the middle class is more visible or vocal than in pre-liberalisation years. It begs the questions: Do commercial boom and an empowered middle class mean selective amnesia; do they lead to what’s called the politics of forgetting?

This is not only about places; it’s equally, or more so, about people. As the city expands and becomes richer – at least certain sections acquire more wealth and wealthy – the poor become invisible or are forgotten, banished as it were to the margins of the city, turned into totems of urban exoticism for tourists the way “poverty tours” are organised in Dharavi. Then, those who speak for the marginalised and ask difficult questions are branded (for example, that obnoxious term “urban naxals”), arrested and thrown into lock-ups.

The words of Prof David Harvey, the distinguished geographer and anthropologist who popularised the idea of “Right to City”, come to mind. “The question of what kind of city we want cannot be divorced from the question of what kind of people we want to be, what kinds of social relations we seek, what relations to nature we cherish, what style of life we desire, or what aesthetic values we hold,” he wrote. What sort of a city do we want?"

Updated: Aug 26, 2018 16:04 IST

John Sidney McCain III had but one employer throughout his iconic and tempestuous career: the United States of America.

It was a family tradition. McCain was a direct descendant, he claimed, of a captain in George Washington’s army during the Revolutionary War.

And like his father and grandfather before him, each four-star admirals named John McCain, he lived in the service of his country: first as a US Navy fighter pilot, then as a lawmaker until his death Saturday at age 81, following a brain cancer diagnosis in the summer of 2017.

He too might have become an admiral, if a Soviet-made surface-to-air missile had not cut short his own high-flying military trajectory on October 26, 1967.

On the day of his 23rd mission over Vietnam, his A-4 Skyhawk was hit as he flew across Hanoi’s skies.

McCain ejected, and parachuted into a small lake in the center of town, where he was nearly lynched by a furious mob. His two arms and right knee were badly broken.

With his father the commander of all US forces in the Pacific, McCain would remain a prisoner of war for more than five years.

He was released in 1973 after the Paris Peace Accords, but the physical consequences of his deliberately ill-treated fractures -- and torture in prison -- would cost him his career as a pilot.

“For some reason it was not my time then, and I do believe that therefore because of that, that I was meant to do something,” he said in a 1989 interview.

Defeated by Obama

That something, it became clear, would be politics. After a few years as the Navy’s Senate liaison, McCain moved to Arizona, the home state of his second wife, and won a seat in the US House of Representatives in 1982.

His ambitions grew, and he rose quickly to the Senate, the most powerful political body in America. It became his second home for 30 years.

McCain long cultivated the image of a Republican maverick, defying his party on issues ranging from campaign finance reform to immigration.

He saw little use for party discipline, an attitude reinforced by his past episodes of rebellion -- as an unruly student at the US Naval Academy, or a hotheaded prisoner provoking his Vietnamese jailers.

“Surviving my imprisonment strengthened my self-confidence, and my refusal of early release taught me to trust my own judgment,” McCain wrote in his 1999 memoir, “Faith of My Fathers.”

It was this unorthodox, unbridled McCain, disdainful of authority and occasionally arrogant, who threw his hat in the ring in the 2000 presidential race.

A self-proclaimed “straight talk” campaigner, he offered Americans his moderate-right vision, while keeping at arm’s length the Christian conservatives that his opponent George W. Bush had successfully seduced.

McCain came up short, but solidified his stature and eventually seized the Republican torch from the unpopular president Bush.

In 2008, he made peace with the party establishment, and finally won the presidential nomination.

With the White House within reach, he made an instinctive -- and deeply controversial -- call. Many of his associates would never forgive him for choosing as his running mate a virtual unknown, the untested Alaska governor Sarah Palin.

The decision helped usher in the grass roots Tea Party revolution and the rise of populism later embodied by Donald Trump.

Democrat Barack Obama easily prevailed in the election. McCain, now twice defeated, took to joking about how he started sleeping like a baby: “Sleep two hours, wake up and cry, sleep two hours, wake up and cry.”

Dismayed by Trump

McCain could work a crowd. In Washington, he held court with reporters in the halls of Congress, at times pithy and impatient.

“That’s a dumb question,” he told one probing journalist.

But the snappy tone could turn to self-deprecation: “I don’t think I’m a very smart guy,” he once said.

He could also be volcanic, especially about causes dear to him: the armed forces, American exceptionalism and, in his later years, the threat posed by Russia’s Vladimir Putin, whom he branded “a murderer and a thug.”

McCain’s fellow Republicans occasionally mocked his interventionist reflexes, noting he could never say no to a war. After all, he once referenced a Beach Boys tune when singing about whether to “bomb bomb bomb” Iran.

To the end, McCain remained convinced that America’s values should be shared and defended worldwide. He routinely hopped a flight to Baghdad, Kabul, Taipei, or a revolution-wracked Kiev, received more like a head of state than a lawmaker.

After the annexation of Crimea, Russia placed his name on a blacklist in retaliation for US-led sanctions. “I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off,” he shot back.

Regarding Russia or Syria, McCain’s voice carried far. But the senator was in effect a general without an army.

Trump’s election seemed to trample on the struggles and ideals of the veteran Republican, who quickly grew dismayed by the billionaire businessman’s nationalism and protectionism, his flirtation with Putin and his seeming contempt for the dignity of the office of president.

He even took issue with Trump’s multiple draft deferments during the Vietnam war, granted after he was diagnosed with bone spurs in his foot.

But none of it made McCain want to recede into happy retirement. Perhaps thinking of his grandfather, who died just days after returning home following Japan’s surrender in World War II, McCain sought to remain in the Senate for as long as he could, even faced with a diagnosis of aggressive brain cancer.

Since December 2017, he was kept away from the Senate floor as he underwent treatment in Arizona -- and received at his ranch a steady stream of friends and colleagues come to bid him farewell, away from the media gaze.

On the eve of his death, his family announced that he was ending his treatment.

McCain let it be known in his memoir published in May, “The Restless Wave,” that he wished to be laid to rest in Maryland, near his old Navy pal, Chuck Larson.

He is survived by his wife Cindy and seven children, three of them from a previous marriage."

Updated: Aug 21, 2018 11:38 IST

There is firmness in his voice but his dignified persona exudes charm. Actor, filmmaker and politician Kamal Haasan is not one to give interviews often, but when he does, he doesn’t mince his words or contain his opinions. In a freewheeling chat, Haasan talks about going strong at 63, his latest film, Vishwaroop 2, doing stunts on his own, embarking on his political journey and his vision forward.

You’ve been an idol to many. What keeps you going?

Applause and appreciation (smiles)! How the audience humbles me by noticing even the smallest things [onscreen] that I thought they might miss, things [that] I lovingly do for them. You can never underestimate their intelligence. I have never done that. It’s easy to say that the audience is dumb, but they have never been so, not mine.

Was promoting your film on reality shows something out of your comfort zone?

I have no aversion to promoting any idea through the right channel. As a matter of fact, I myself am hosting a reality show in Tamil Nadu against the good advice of friends who said don’t even go there (laughs). But, I enjoy it. I have a platform that those people advising me can’t reach; it’s an opportunity that they should have understood, too. For me, I am talking 3.2 crore tune-ins, and that exponentially increases if you look at the number of eyeballs that are on me.

You still do your own stunts. Is it worth the risk at 63?

There was an opportunity to talk to Mr Jackie Chan and we were comparing notes and he said, ‘How many fractures?’ I said, ‘36’. And he was like ‘Oh, you’re catching up. I must do something better now’. He said he has 15. So, when you talk of age, he’s elder to me and the kind of stunts he does, I was no one to risk it. Even now [at 64], he does them. I agree [that a] certain amount of training is required and I’m one of the few actors who actually took training; I had stuntmen living with me and training me.

You’ve embarked on your political journey. Are films going to take a backseat?

I would have preferred this (Vishwaroop 2) to be the last outing, but I have made commitments to people, which I will complete. But otherwise, my mind is already flying in another sphere and I’ve seen essence of Tamil Nadu and our nation, and I want to be a part of that [with my party, Makkal Needhi Maiam].

Can political ideologies of celebrities bring about a change in society?

Everybody’s idea can bring about a change but the high profile, the influencers get noticed [more]. They have as much right as students to talk about politics. And they should because politics affects everyone’s life. Celebs should comment [on issues], and they will. Everybody is qualified to talk about politics.

Do people take actors any less seriously when they address national and social issues?

It depends on how sensibly you talk. The moment there is sense in the talk, they become credible and respectable.

Have politicians, who were once actors, set a benchmark?

My bars, I know, when and how far I can raise them. We’re working on it. To talk about others is not the best way to explain your point. So, I’m qualifying myself, prepping; and even for my films, I prep well and the result shows. And I’m very sure that in this field as well, that preparation and studiousness will get paid for.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee was very simple and approachable. Despite being a leader, he never brought politics and ego to his paternal village Bateshwar, recalls Ram Singh Azad, 58, who was Vajpayee’s swimming companion at the ghats of Yamuna here.

“Atalji was very friendly to me despite age and ideological differences. Even political opponents held him in high esteem,” claimed Azad.

Azad had been a Congressman in early years and later switched to the Samajwadi Party, but he always admired Vajpayee for never bringing politics to his paternal village.

“I was only 15 years when Atalji came to Bateshwar in the seventies. Despite being the leader of opposition in Parliament, he was so simple and approachable. We respected him as our elder. He could have spent more time in Bateshwar but his father had a job in the education department in Gwalior. Still, Atalji maintained his relationship with Bateshwar,” said Azad who was shocked to hear about the former PM’s demise.

“My grandfather was Atalji’s companion during the freedom struggle. In 1978, I requested him to have a photograph clicked with us. We were hesitating as he was leader of opposition, but despite being in bathing attire, he got ready for the photograph,” recalled Azad.

“I was a Congressman but got closer to the Samajwadi Party and was thus kept away from Vajpayeeji when he came to Bateshwar in 1999 as Prime Minister to address a rally. But that did not affect my admiration for the leader whose demise created a vacuum in the political world,” stated Azad with tears in his eyes.

“Bharat Ratna Vajpayeeji had represented the nation in the biggest ‘panchayat’ of the world (read UNO). He never gave undue favours to Bateshwar but we are proud to be fellow villagers of such a great soul,” asserted Azad.

HE RELISHED SAMOSAS

Residents of the Taj city on Friday remained glued to television to see the last rites of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who breathed his last on Thursday. Many gathered at various locations and offered floral tributes to the departed leader. “Atalji used to ask about shops selling his favourite dishes and would not hesitate in having ‘parantha’ from Rambabu Parantha Bhandar or ‘samosa’ from Deviram halwai or ‘kachori’ from Rama Sweets in Agra,” said Purshottam Khandelwal, state vice president of the BJP. In Bateshwar, the villagers gathered at the Shiva Temple on Yamuna bank to condole his death. “We are still to come to terms with this sad news,” said Ram Prasad, a villager.

MLA GETS HEAD SHAVED

Five –time MLA from Agra North Jagan Prasad Garg had his head shaved while attending the funeral of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi on Friday. This was as a mark of respect on the demise of a ‘fatherly’ figure, said the MLA who now plans to serve food to 25 Brahmins on August 29, the thirteenth day after the funeral of the departed leader. ‘Atalji was a fatherly figure to me and ensured my first ticket for assembly election in 1998 from Agra East (now Agra North) as BJP candidate. He had showered his blessing on me for the past 25 years and on his death, I felt as if I had lost my father. So I decided to get my head shaved as befits a son, “he told HT.

ASCETIC SHUNS FOOD AFTER HEARING ABOUT ATAL

Agra ‘Sant’ Nepal Dass, 80, from Bateshwar refuses to eat ever since he came to know about former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s death. Nepal Dass belongs to Bateshwar, the paternal village of Vajpayee in Agra district. He claimed he had a shop in Delhi but returned to Bateshwar after renouncing the world and embracing ‘sanyas’. He heard about Atal’s on Thursday and is abstaining from food since then."

Updated: Aug 14, 2018 01:02 IST

As they are trying to put together a coalition against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the coming elections, both the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are keen on getting the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on board.

It was the NCP chief Sharad Pawar who took initiative to get the BSP as part of the Congress-NCP-led coalition in Maharashtra. Apparently, Pawar discussed the possibility of BSP’s inclusion in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) when BSP supremo Mayawati and senior leader Satishchandra Mishra met him in New Delhi on July 25.

In Maharashtra, leaders from both the Congress and the NCP are now weighing the possibility of wooing Dalit voters by getting an aggressive face like Mayawati’s as part of their coalition.

The next Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Maharashtra could be a close fight between the ruling and the opposition parties—whether the BJP and the Shiv Sena contest together or separately.

In a close contest, the Dalit votes will be important. As of now, the coalition of opposition parties does not have any Dalit leader with a statewide appeal to seek votes for them. Of the two prominent Dalit leaders in Maharashtra, Ramdas Athawale has already announced that he will continue with the BJP-led coalition, which he had joined in 2014.

Though the Congress is keen on getting him on board, Prakash Ambedkar is playing a hardball. He has also indicated that he would prefer to put together a third front of likeminded parties. As a last resort, both the main opposition parties are willing to roll out the red carpet for Mayawati to make a second entry into Maharashtra politics.

The mood in the Congress-NCP camp is exactly the opposite of what it was a decade ago. In 2007, after the BSP won Uttar Pradesh assembly elections and Mayawati became the chief minister of India’s largest state on her own, she wanted a strong presence in Maharashtra.

The two parties were then in power in Maharashtra and opposed to the BSP getting a foothold in the state. They wanted the Dalit leaders in Maharashtra to be in control of the community’s votes and not Mayawati. There was a reason. The Congress-NCP leaders always found it easy to work with the established Dalit leaders in the state. They knew the latter’s brand of politics, their limited political ambitions and how far the latter would go.

They considered the Mayawati-led BSP as a much more aggressive party and were wary that the BSP would take a chunk of Dalit votes and would be open to aligning with any other party, even the BJP-Shiv Sena, as it had done earlier in Uttar Pradesh.

In the 2009 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the BSP tried hard but couldn’t win any seat. It, however, bagged a significant amount of votes in the Vidarbha region.

Now in 2018-19, Congress-NCP leaders want the BSP on their side as they are preparing to counter the BJP. But then, can Mayawati and her BSP make an impact on Dalit politics in Maharashtra now?

There is considerable unease among the Dalits in Maharashtra following the Una and Bhima-Koregaon episodes. Also, there is unhappiness among the Dalit youth with regard to the existing leaders over their tame response to these issues. They want aggressive leaders.

Dalit politics in the state has been typical and has remained unchanged in decades. The parties with Dalit-centred agenda have remained fragmented. Established Dalit leaders are not much ambitious and have been aligning with the ruling or opposition parties to pursue their limited agenda through electoral politics.

Mayawati and her party work with a disciplined and aggressive approach. They aim at garnering a significant share of power. If they catch the fancy of Dalit voters, the existing leaders will have a tough time holding on to their support base.

The only hitch is that the BSP doesn’t have a strong local leader in Maharashtra and relies entirely on Mayawati’s ability to draw voters. In fact, in the state’s political circles, they say that the central leadership of the BSP doesn’t want any strong leader here. If that is the case, there are doubts about how long the BSP would go in Maharashtra. However, in such a scenario, Congress-NCP won’t mind befriending the BSP."

Updated: Aug 10, 2018 10:27 IST

Even as an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) has been booked in a case of alleged torture of seven men by the Sanaur police on Sunday, politics has taken over the issue with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress trading barbs and accusations.

On Thursday, the local SAD leadership, including MLA Sanaur Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra, accompanied Akal Takht jathedar Gurbachan Singh to visit the injured, Amandeep, at Government Rajindra Hospital.

At the hospital, the jathedar said, “The SGCP has formed a four-member inquiry panel that will submit its report and then we will decide the future course of action.” Incidentally, deputy commissioner Kumar Amit has already ordered a magisterial probe into the case.

Upping the ante even further, MLA Chandumajra announced a Sanaur bandh on August 11 (Saturday) and the holding of a rally outside chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s residence the same day. On Thursday, they held a protest opposite the Sanaur police station.

“It’s a shocking incident. The SAD will not tolerate any type of repression. The ASI could not have thrashed those boys single-handedly. A few other officials were also involved and they must be punished,” Chandumajra said.

“The boy was fine and was to be discharged in the morning, but he insisted that he will stay. Later in the day, these politicians started visiting him. It’s all politics. The patient had no grievous injury and there was no sign of any sexual assault,” said a doctor privy to the medical report of Amandeep.

The victim’s mother has been demanding a job and compensation from the government, in addition to strict punishment for the guilty. On Wednesday, former Union minister Preneet kaur had visited the family.

Sinister design of SAD: Congress

In response to the SAD and the SGPC, Congress leader Harinderpal Singh Harry Mann said, “I condemn the incident, but more condemnable is the politics which the Chandumajra family is playing over the issue. The Chandumajra family is using the SGPC for its personal political motives.”

He added, “The Akal Takht jathedar should have refrained from being part of this sinister design of local SAD leaders. I want to know that why did the jathedar not visit Bargari, where Sikhs were killed for protesting against sacrilege incidents. Even now, who has stopped the jathedar from visiting people sitting on protest in Bargari.”

He added that in this, a torture case, the police had booked the erring ASI by name and also marked a magisterial probe, but Chandumajra needed to explain that why no such FIR was registered by name against erring police officials, who had fired on Sikhs at Bargari."

Updated: Aug 08, 2018 11:52 IST

There are many qualities that distinguish DMK leader Muthuvel Karunanidhi from other politicians in Tamil Nadu. These include his humble origins, a socially-embedded political awareness and political activism right since childhood. He began his social and political campaigns at 14, heeding the call of EVR Periyar and CN Annadurai in Tamil Nadu’s social justice movements. Both his lifelong commitment towards social justice and frontline advocacy of language made him a champion of Dravidian politics.

The great survivor of Tamil Nadu politics, Karunanidhi was an eloquent orator, a Tamil writer of repute, indomitable publisher and all-weather political strategist. He was an unassuming party campaigner and dedicated communicator who wrote everyday messages to the cadre, penned articles for Murasoli (sound of drums), the DMK’s official newspaper, proofread copies until midnight and then woke up at 4.30 AM to read and record his notes for more than fifty years of his political life. These qualities are testimony to the remarkable career of a politician who had been chief minister five times, was elected 12 times to the Tamil Nadu assembly and once to the erstwhile Tamil Nadu legislative council. Among the qualities that endeared him to friends, critics and political foes were his accessibility and ability to face criticism without bitterness and listen to different perspectives even if he disagreed with them.

Karunanidhi’s role in national politics deserves more attention than it drew during his active political years. As an advocate of state autonomy, he put up stiff resistance to authoritarian rule by then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the dark and brutal Emergency of 1975-77 without worrying about the consequences that included the dismissal of the DMK government and imprisonment of party leaders, including his son, MK Stalin. The role of party newspaper Murasoli and Karunanidhi’s craft for communicating resistance against the Emergency and the draconian MISA will remain etched in the annals of struggles against political tyranny in the country.

The post-Emergency years and the rise of MG Ramachandran after the DMK split in 1972 led to the diminishing of political fortunes for the party. Though Karunanidhi could never wrest power from MGR and the AIADMK for as long as MGR was alive, he steadfastly refused to see a halo around MGR’s larger-than-life persona. Karunanidhi survived almost 13 years in active politics as leader of the opposition after serving as chief minister twice and kept the hopes of his party and cadre alive because of his ideological strength, organisational skills and mobilisational strategies until the return of DMK to power in 1989.

It was during the launch of the National Front in Chennai in October 1988 that Karunanidhi reinvented himself in national politics. He supported VP Singh and his announcement of the Mandal Commission Report with a call for social justice. With the onset of the coalition era in Indian politics, Karunanidhi never looked back. His role in the launching of National Front in October 1988 is a turning point in altering the bipolar national political scenario into a multi-level coalitional strategy in which Karunanidhi played excellent host and strategist in knitting together the seven-party National Front at Chennai.

The electoral defeats in the assembly elections of 2011 and the parliamentary elections in 2014 led to ideological erosion within the party and alienation of dedicated DMK cadre. But Karunanidhi changed with time as his children grew old enough to be able to to lay claim to his legacy. Although he resisted a feud within the family, he ultimately had to give in. Yet he made his priorities clear in outlining the course of a clear leadership transition in the DMK.

The precarious period from 2004 to 2014 contained both the peaking of power and the seeds of decline of the DMK. Neither the DMK nor Karunanidhi were the same again after the alleged “ethnic cleansing” of Tamils in Sri Lanka in 2009. Soon after that, the DMK’s bargaining for power sharing in New Delhi in the UPA government dealt a big dent to Karunanidhi and the party.

Whether it was the electoral alliance with the Congress-I led by Indira Gandhi in 1972 or the BJP-led NDA coalition in 1998, Karunanidhi made and unmade alliances based on electoral fortunes than political convictions. He treated allies and rivals alike unequivocally like a seasoned gardener cutting, trimming, and shifting seeds of fortune in the thorny bushes of Indian politics. With his passing away, politics in Tamil Nadu awaits a generational change as time carries away a warrior of Dravidian politics and the last among the giants of first-generation Tamil Nadu politicians after independence.

Karunanidhi leaves his party secure in the hands of his son MK Stalin and the state uncertain with the BJP threatening to alter the political discourse. The political message is clear: This is not the end of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, but a shifting of focus towards civil society movements. The battle lines are being redrawn.

Ajit Singh, founder president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), was recently in the news when his statement to the press in Baghpat last week gave rise to speculation that he was taking ‘sanyas’ (renunciation) from politics. Later, however, he clarified that he did not mean that. His son and party vice-president Jayant Chaudhary also made it clear that his father alone would take a call on things related to alliance, seat-sharing for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. In an interview over the phone from Delhi, Singh spoke on a number of issues, saying politics of love and unity alone could defeat the ‘divisive’ BJP.

Excerpts:

Are you planning to quit politics?

No, not all. Actually, some media persons asked me whether I will contest the next election, to which I said I was 80 now and it was not necessary for me to contest an election every time. I told them the Lok Sabha polls were still far away and I would take a call when the time came. But they interpreted my statement to mean that I am quitting politics.

Lok Sabha polls may be a bit far away, but there is already keenness in the opposition camp to sew up an anti-BJP grand alliance for 2019.

The political parties have already united against the BJP and this was evident during all the by-polls held in Phupur, Gorakhpur, Kairana and Noorpur in UP. Not only do political parties want a grand alliance, but the people also want the anti-BJP forces to join hands. However, the issues relating to seat-sharing and leadership will be discussed at the appropriate time.

But it is not clear as to who will lead the grand alliance and neither does the opposition have a common candidate to project as the prime ministerial face. Don’t you think this is the opposition’s biggest weakness?

You tell me did we go to people with a common face in the by-polls? See, ours is a parliamentary democracy, not a presidential one. The leaders of opposition parties will sit together and decide on their leader after the elections. As of now, our attention is on the forthcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The Congress is already projecting Rahul Gandhi as the PM candidate for 2019?

There is nothing unusual about this. All political parties want their leaders to be the PM. The BSP is projecting Mayawati as the PM face and the TMC wants Mamata Banerjee to be the PM candidate whereas the TRS wants to see their leader as the next prime minister.

Then, how can there be a consensus on one name when so many leaders are nurturing prime ministerial ambitions?

As I said earlier, opposition parties will choose their leader after the elections depending on various things, like which party got how many numbers in the Lok Sabha. That is not a big thing. Such issues have been resolved amicably in the past too.

Do you think the SP-BSP will be able to pull together till the Lok Sabha elections, more so when Mayawati’s political ambitions, many feel, are growing to the extent that it may cause fissures in their friendship?

Why not? At least I have not seen or heard anything going wrong with their alliance. As for Mayawati’s ambitions, there is nothing wrong with that because all leaders have ambitions. The crux is that there is a broad consensus among the parties that defeating the BJP is necessary.

So, you admit that the common glue holding the opposition parties together is the feeling of ousting the BJP at any cost?

Naturally, the opposition always wants to dislodge the ruling party through elections, but it is the voters who decide finally and when it comes to voting, they will certainly vote on the basis of the government’s performance. People are asking as to what happened to the tall promises related to farmers, youth, smart cities, Swachh Bharat, Ganga rejuvenation and the like. But the BJP wants nobody should discuss these. They want discussion on Hindu-Muslim, cow protection, lynching etc.

What role do you see for the RLD in 2019?

We are trying to foster brotherhood and love among farmers, urging them to unite and rise above caste and religion because the BJP has ruined them. I launched a year-long campaign from Muzaffarnagar on February 13 to spread this message to people. The BJP is spreading hate and engineering division in the society to win and I strongly feel that the easiest way to defeat the BJP is by promoting ‘bhai-chara’ (brotherhood) and ‘pyar-mohabbat’ (love) in the society.

It is said that the opposition’s no-trust motion against the Modi government recently backfired. Your take?

Absolutely not. On the contrary, the government was exposed on the floor of the House. The BJP leaders’ gloomy faces in the House that day said it all. The government was not able to respond to any questions including, one on the Rafale deal.

There was a lot of debate on the social media over Rahul Gandhi hugging PM Modi during the debate on the no-confidence motion in Parliament. How do you see the hugging episode?

I do not see anything wrong with Rahul Gandhi taking the initiative to embrace Modi. He was merely conveying the message to Modi that he did not hold anything against him personally. Modi should have reciprocated the goodwill gesture.

Any possibility of the RLD joining hands with the BJP, an old ally?

(Laying emphasis) The question does not arise at all."

Updated: Jul 31, 2018 00:12 IST

For exactly a week now, Maharashtra has been witnessing violent agitations by Maratha community outfits for the demand of reservation in government jobs and education. The community, which is roughly one-third of the state’s population (32%) is out on streets demanding immediate solution as the 16% reservation granted to it by the government in 2014 is stuck in the court.

This is the second round of the Maratha protests. Over a year ago, the community outfits took out 58 silent marches that were applauded for the disciplined manner in which they were organised. However, this round is violent. Apparently, the outfits that staged the silent marches are not entirely in control of these protests and there is danger of the agitations going berserk as evident from the incidents that took place at Navi Mumbai last week and at Chakan (Pune) this week.

The agitations have put the Maratha reservation issue back at the centre of state politics once again.

Expectedly, the Devendra Fadnavis-led government in the state is getting politically isolated over this issue with its ally Shiv Sena as well as opposition Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) putting responsibility on it for the delay in Marathas getting the reservation. Almost all prominent parties have started deliberations on the issue and are also gauging the impact it will have on them.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is wary of the negative impact the agitation may have on it. As such, the government has been showing patience while handling the agitations and the police have been avoiding using force unless it is absolutely necessary. Fadnavis is trying hard to ensure that Marathas don’t go completely against the BJP. He knows the number of Maratha votes coming their way might be less in 2019 as compared to 2014, but wants to ensure that there is no anti-BJP sentiment among them. At the same time, he is aware that the Marathas becoming more and more aggressive would irk other castes—notably Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and Scheduled Castes—who may sympathise with the BJP. Some castes within the OBCs were not happy with the BJP in past couple of years but may prefer it as a reaction to aggression shown by Marathas. Several BJP leaders are pointing out that the non-Maratha Hindus are more than 50% in Maharashtra and as such the current situation may not be a bad scenario for their party. What happened with the agitation by Patel-Patidars in neighbouring Gujarat is a case to remember, they say.

The calculations in the opposition camp are different. Marathas form significant part of the support base of the Congress and the NCP. The community played a major role as the Congress (and its offshoot NCP) ruled the state most of the 58 years since 1960 when the state was formed. As such, most of the chief ministers of the state came from that community. Little wonder that both the parties support the demand of the community.

As far as the Congress-NCP are concerned, a large chunk of Maratha votes that went to the BJP-Sena in 2014 due to reasons such as anti-incumbency and Modi wave could come back to them if Marathas get angry with the ruling parties. Marathas along with minorities, Dalits, tribals, and a chunk of OBC could become a formidable combination for the Opposition parties in 2019.

The two parties however are avoiding being much vocal on the issue because they don’t want to antagonise other castes, especially the OBCs. That was why, after the meeting of the legislators on Monday, the Congress demanded that the government should grant reservations to Marathas, Dhangars (Shepherds) and Muslims. That is also the strategy of the Shiv Sena which is supporting the Marathas, but avoiding going over the top. The OBCs and Hindu Dalits form significant support base for the party. While Opposition parties are weighing the calculations as Maratha outfits are resorting to violent protests, many in the ruling BJP are wary of the unease between Fadnavis and his party colleagues in the state cabinet. Fadnavis’ close aides are lamenting that none of the senior ministers are rushing to the chief minister’s defence as he is being targeted by the Maratha outfits. Except revenue minister Chandrakant Patil, most ministers have preferred to keep quiet. The ministers, on the other hand, point out how they are not taken in confidence on key issues and as such they prefer not to speak on any issues unless they are asked to.

So, what will be the impact of the Maratha unrest? Nobody knows for sure."

Updated: Jul 06, 2018 20:16 IST

Sometimes when the pitch is flat, it isn’t a terrible thing. The football World Cup in Russia has been on song partly due to the lesser lights proving that the divide between traditional powerhouses and the rest is gradually shrinking.

The early elimination of Germany, Argentina, Portugal and Spain points to that shifting landscape, although enough exciting teams remain for an unpredictable finale. While the matches continue on the field, one winner was on the sidelines during the opening encounter between host Russia and Saudi Arabia. That may well have been an omen for how things have gone for Moscow this summer, and that doesn’t even refer to the home team’s opening performance. There was Russian President Vladimir Putin watching, conveying his wonder at the outcome — not just the scoreline that day, 5-0 for the Russians, but how the tournament has been a publicity coup for the strongman. The carping over the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 was missing, and while there were complaints on how the event was normalising the Putin regime, those dissipated as it progressed.

The World Cup also provides the perfect platform for yet another Putin PR win: The meeting with his American counterpart Donald Trump in Helsinki the day after the final, also just following the NATO summit in Belgium. Timing, as with a striker’s goalward bound shot, is everything and, unless dramatic events happen off the field between now and then, Putin will have already seized that advantage.

Trump is unlikely to be very clued into the niceties of the action on the pitch, but even football has given him yet another opportunity to preen. That, of course, is taking credit for FIFA, football’s governing body, giving the 2026 tournament to the United States, Canada and Mexico. You could call that the NAFTA Cup, except that nobody knows if NAFTA will still be around by then. That cooperative contest has been scheduled even as the continental compact suffers from Trump’s tariff wars and the wild card of a new populist leader in Mexico.

Those will make for a politically-loaded arrangement even as the free trade agreement’s revision or rejection will form a compelling narrative in the years ahead to the World Cup’s buildup. The best part of the 2026 Cup, though probably not for purists, is that it will expand to 48 teams, and with a fourth of the world’s nations represented at North American venues that year, perhaps even India will finally find its place within that fraternity. That may be a distant dream, but sometimes long shots do come off, as the current Cup has again shown.

But for most, the politics pervading these events is, for a while, secondary to the actual action. This truly great game, at least for 90 minutes (or more, during the knockout rounds), thankfully overshadows the Great Game of geopolitics being played out across the world.

The BJP propaganda machine, ably assisted by its army of spokespersons and Twitter trolls, would have us believe that the nation never received a fortune greater than the NDA government that came to power in 2014, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But for four years now, we have a government that has claimed to promote politics of development, while betraying its real intentions. We have watched how democratically elected governments have been subverted, mandates disregarded and federalism perverted. Self-interest has been the cornerstone of the government; a politics devoid of any principles its hallmark. The architecture of political opportunism that the BJP has built has been abused to subvert every democratic principle that they supposedly stand for — misuse of State power to weaken institutions, vicious politics to discredit the Opposition, and lofty claims about their schemes’ success, abandoning allies when convenient, and their most widely used weapon: maintaining silence when expedient.

Silence has been the most favoured weapon in the BJP’s arsenal. The PM, who likes to tweet, has been silent on lynchings, which have continued unabated since the 2015 murder of Mohammad Ikhlaq. In Hapur (Uttar Pradesh), we witnessed the assault on two men on “rumours” of cow slaughter; in Karbi-Anglong (Assam), two men were lynched on suspicion of child lifting; violence gripped parts of Bihar and West Bengal during Ram Navami. The BJP’s failure to take action against the perpetrators of such crimes has spawned an army of murderous mobs, who don’t care for the rule of law. The polarisation is fast reaching a point of no return and does not bode well for our nation. Why has the BJP failed to issue a warning to those who spread hatred? Why did not a single colleague of Sushma Swaraj stand up for her when she was attacked by trolls for doing her job? Is it a coincidence that many of these trolls are “blessed to be followed” by the PM and other senior ministers?

For a government that constantly talks about “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” (BBBP), their double standards are shameful. A report by the Thomson Reuters Foundation has ranked India as the most unsafe country for women. A BJP MLA from Unnao is himself a rape accused, while former BJP ministers participated in a rally in support of the Kathua rape accused. A CAG report on the BBBP programme has found that the lack of policy implementation, diversion of funds and a weak monitoring mechanism have led to a fall in sex ratio at birth in various districts of Haryana and Punjab, as of 2015.

This government has also repeatedly failed to safeguard interests of the SCs/STs, whether by allowing dilution of the Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act, or the recurring incidents of violence against Dalits and tribals. In Madhya Pradesh, a group of men poured kerosene on a Dalit farmer and set him on fire after a land dispute (one of the accused was a BJP OBC cell worker). Last week, a report by a Dalit women’s collective said as many as 33% of SC women faced physical violence since they were 15, while 26% of ST women faced violence, made worse by the lack of legal recourse and nexus among authorities, who protect perpetrators of these crimes. The Centre may like to pass the buck of law and order on to states, but the fact remains that the BJP-ruled states lead the pack when it comes to violence against women, Dalits, tribals and other weak groups.

This tendency to abandon responsibility when the going gets tough is not new to the BJP. Consider Jammu and Kashmir, where it came together with the PDP, disregarding the popular mandate. The alliance was a mismatch from the outset. Yet, they continued. A wounded Valley that needed confidence-building measures found itself on the receiving end of the BJP’s muscular policy, leading to violence. The 2003 ceasefire agreement with Pakistan is in a shambles. The BJP-PDP alliance never grew into a credible government. And now, the BJP with its eye on polls has abandoned the state, and with it, any moral and political leadership it claimed. AB Vajpayee’s ‘insaniyat, Kashmiriyat, jamhuriyat’, invoked a couple of years ago by the PM, lies forgotten.

The BJP’s opportunism and hypocrisy have also led to a trust deficit in the NDA coalition. Their dominating and deceitful approach to non-BJP states also affects the spirit of cooperative federalism. Our foreign relations and economy also stand crippled. Pressing issues of rising unemployment, women’s safety, autonomy in the functioning of state institutions, national security, and the rising dissatisfaction among stakeholders in the NDA alliance is coming to haunt the BJP-led government as its tenure is coming to an end.

The BJP is now a symbol of misgovernance. Today, as our wounded nation seeks peace, BJP members are intent on wilfully misinterpreting the Constitution for political gains. In 71 years of its existence, India has never seen days so dark, where caste, religion, gender have been abused to drive animosity, justified outrageous acts, and drown out any sense of nationhood. Economic progress is worthless without the enrichment of the soul.

Today, the BJP’s practice of toxic politics poses a threat to the soul of India.

In 1630 when the Maratha noblewoman Jijabai brought forth the second of her two sons, little did she imagine that the boy would grow up to shatter forever the might of the Mughal empire. But the Deccan into which Shivaji arrived was a fascinating place. Until four years before his birth, for instance, the hero of the plateau was a Muslim warrior called Malik Ambar, whose career began in slavery in Africa, and culminated at the height of power and glory here in India. The local Sultan was the Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar, whose ancestors were Brahmins, but whose line welcomed brides of both African and Persian extraction. Shivaji’s own grandfather, Maloji, was closely affiliated with both Malik Ambar and the Nizam Shahi dynasty, while his maternal family lent their men and resources to the imperial Mughals of Agra. The horizon was one of unending military drama, and when Shivaji was still a child, the last of the Nizam Shahs was incarcerated in a Mughal fortress, his ancestral dominions swallowed in bits and pieces by Emperor Shahjahan and his forces.

The Deccan That Was

The Deccan was once home to great dynasties such as the Yadavas who fell before Alauddin Khilji in the fourteenth century, making way for what later became the Bahmani Sultanate. These early military encounters were times of massive cultural disruption, though soon enough the new kings settled down and reached an accommodation with subjects of the old. The Bahmanis and their heirs in Maharashtra, the Nizam Shahs, connected the Deccan to Islamic networks of international commerce, establishing also in the region a Persianised court culture. They married Maratha women, patronised the Marathi language, and were nourished by local traditions – there could be no other way, for the Muslim aristocracy in the urban centres was handicapped without the cooperation of those who dominated the vast and diverse countryside. And so, wisely, they joined hands with older leaders of the land, and together birthed something new, enduring for centuries in splendour till the ambitions of a northern emperor reduced them to another tragic chapter.

But the Marathas too developed their identity in this age of Muslim power, embracing the best of Indo-Islamic tradition. Shivaji’s father and uncle – Shahaji and Sharifji – were both, for instance, named after a Muslim saint called Shah Sharif. If one travels to Ellora, the ancestral seat of the Bhonsle clan, the samadhis of Shivaji’s grandfather and others so resemble Islamic mausoleums that they have been mistaken for “tombs” like those of the Nizam Shahs and the legendary Malik Ambar.

The African general, in fact, when he established the city that became Aurangabad, even named its various quarters after Maratha commanders, paying homage to their loyalty. In costume, cuisine, and vocabulary too, the Sultans left their imprint, and many were the Maratha families that traced their glory to the service of these Muslim sovereigns. Together they made history – when in the previous century the Deccan’s Sultans destroyed Vijayanagar, for example, fighting for the Muslim princes were thousands of Maratha warriors. In matters of faith also, meanwhile, there was conversation. Contemporaneous with the saint Tukaram was Muntoji, a scion of the Bahmani dynasty who equated the bismillah with the invocation of Rama, while Eknath featured in his works not only Brahmins and untouchables, but also Muslims and

Africans.

The Rise Of Shivaji

Shivaji, however, was a man who designed a new conception of power. Where his father was acclaimed by a Sultan as ‘the abode of intrepidity and grandeur’, ‘the pillar of the mighty state’, and even ‘my son’, Shivaji saw in the decline of regional Muslim power an opportunity to consecrate a whole new order. Many were the Marathas who saw the choice as one between preserving regional Muslim potentates, or accepting the Mughal embrace. Shivaji, however, desired something different altogether, one in which Persian and Islamicate influences were consciously discarded to celebrate a ‘Maharashtra Dharma’. When once a Maratha grandee declined Shivaji’s invitation to join forces, emphasising his loyalty to a Muslim superior, Shivaji reminded him that his course was not one of disloyalty – instead it was of a higher loyalty to their local deity in whose name they ought to create a ‘Hindavi’ kingdom. No longer was he interested in accepting the supremacy of Persianised padshahs – not when he could become a Maratha padshah, and establish a kingdom of his own.

To be clear, this was not communalism where large numbers of people woke overnight to the realisation that they constituted “the Hindus”, seizing arms to destroy a blanket category called “the Muslims”. Shivaji’s work was, however, the crystallisation of a new ideology among the political elite of the land. Even as he employed Muslims and supported qazis to dispense justice, Shivaji actively searched for a new form of political expression rooted in Sanskritic tradition.

Genealogical claims linked him with the Rajputs in the north, and by the end of his life, Shivaji was writing letters not in Persian – the language of diplomacy at the time – but in Sanskrit. As the Rajyavyavaharakosa (an official dictionary) he commissioned declares, ‘overvalued Yavana [foreign] words’ were replaced with ‘educated speech’.

He had nothing against Muslims as a people, but he jettisoned older systems built on Islamic ideals and sought instead another on terms inspired by Indian high-tradition. While he allied with Sultans like the Qutb Shah of Golconda (whose ministers were Brahmins); when he challenged fellow Hindu Marathas (whose loyalties lay with Sultans); and even as he himself came, on one occasion, close to being absorbed into the Mughal court, Shivaji was creating a fresh self-image which the chronicle Sabhasad bakhar describes as navi paddhati or the new course. It was by no stretch nationalism defined in communal terms – it was very much a feudal order, derived, however, from Hindu roots.

Building Sivabharata

Of course, the project was fraught with the contradictions only natural in this age of diverse identities and fragmented political authority – self-image might not always reflect lived reality on the ground, and even the Mughals often spoke in a religiously charged idiom that concealed cooperation when it came to actual business. The Sivabharata, a grand epic eulogising the deeds of Shivaji, was composed in the Maratha king’s own lifetime, giving on the one hand a vision of his political philosophy, while also acknowledging long-standing links between Islamic and Hindu interests in actual transactions.

Shivaji was, according to his court poet, an incarnation of Vishnu, who ‘crushes unruly Muslims’. He protected Brahmins and cows, and ‘descended the earth to strike’ enemy Sultans. Islamic rule was a wicked force, manifest on earth ‘disguised as barbarians’ to conquer and command. ‘Foreign religions (mlechcha dharma)’ grew, complains the Sivabharata, and there was ‘great fear’ among the righteous and the just. ‘All these clans of Muslims are incarnations of demons,’ we read at one point, ‘risen up to flood the earth with their own religion.’ Shivaji, then, is presented as the restorer of a classical idea of balance, the deliverer of a Sanskritic notion of justice.

But the heady picture here is a formal aspiration – in reality, even the Sivabharata recognises a more complex cultural universe. Like the Hindu god Karthikeya who was protected by the gods when he battled an asura, we have the poem present Malik Ambar, shielded by Shivaji’s father and other lords in his war against the Mughals – Ambar, an African Muslim ‘as brave as the sun’, is likened to a Hindu god, while the mighty enemy to the north is cast as a demon. When Shahaji leaves the Nizam Shah’s ranks, he is ‘nostalgic’ about their shared, intertwined past; as he accepts service with the Adil Shah of Bijapur, another of the Deccan’s Sultans, that kingdom is likened to the land of ‘Lord Rama himself’. The Nizam Shah, whose associate Shivaji’s grandfather was is described as a dharmatma, to whom barbs against ‘Turks’ do not apply. And when Afzal Khan is despatched to destroy Shivaji, with him march Marathas – Jadhav, Bhonsle, Naik, Ghorpade and more – while Shivaji, we know, held the loyalty of men like Siddi Ibrahim.

He was eventually bought by the Nizam Shah’s Peshwa and brought to India, where he rose to military and political glory and established the city that became Aurangabad.

In theory, then, the Sivabharata visualised a ‘Hindavi’ kingdom built on a rejection of Islamic kingship, but even Shivaji’s court poet could not ignore the reality of Muslim-Maratha associations in this turbulent period. There was ideology that was different from its predecessors’, and then there was mixed reality – each fed off the other, and neither was absolute in its influence.

The Sivabharata, however, also had another significant role to play, one in which an emphasis on Sanskritic tradition was integral. Completed in time for the coronation ceremony that saw Shivaji transformed from warlord into consecrated king, a poem like this was essential to cementing his legitimacy as a sovereign. It was not, in itself, original – the emperors of Vijayanagar had applied the word ‘Hindu’ to define their self-image, even as, without irony, they did battle with other Hindu kings and employed Muslims by the thousands. A Telugu text, similarly, articulated before Shivaji a ‘Hindu’ ideology of statehood and kingship, comparing some Muslim kings with the devil while treating, ironically, the Mughals as blessed by the gods. Islamic texts too exaggerated themes such as ‘the destruction of infidels’, when reality was often vastly different.

A Syncretic Society

Black and white were not the colours through which these voices perceived their world – there was an elite visualisation of ‘Turks’ and there was another of Hindus, but boundaries between the two were not entirely clear. Indeed, in a Sivabharata canto, among the lands Shivaji promises to conquer are not only those of ‘evil Turks’ but also the rulers of Madras and Kandahar; those in Kashmir and Kerala – and many other Hindu principalities who too, like Muslims, did not meet the standards of his Hindavi vision.

Shivaji, then, was a challenge to the establishment of his day, an establishment defined in terms that were Persianised and Islamic. And his was a challenge asserted in a consciously Hindu fashion. Was he creating a nationalist ‘Hindu State’ as his Hindavi kingdom is today sometimes defined, or was his world entirely syncretic, a melting pot of cultural influences?

The answer lies somewhere in the middle – where culture and the lives of the people were an ocean of shared experience, the politics of the elite could define itself in language that sought to establish competing narratives. Energised by both, the eclectic traditions of his land, and the righteous force of ideology, Shivaji established his Maratha swaraj.

The Deccan where he was born had seen Hindu princes absorb Muslim influence, and Muslim kings worship Hindu gods; it had seen Brahmins become Sultans, and a Muslim seek Brahminhood. Now, however, it opened a new chapter in the history of India, one in which this land became the scene of contested power, destined to go down also as the graveyard of the Mughals and their formidable empire. And the man who stood at the cusp of this great transformation was Shivaji the Maratha, Vishnu-incarnate in Sanskrit poetry, pragmatic warrior-king in reality.

There can be no two views about illegal colonies — the state has 8,000 unauthorised sprawls at the last count — being an urban nightmare in Punjab, but consensus eludes the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress gover nment on the approach needed to tackle the recurring problem. Local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and housing and urban development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa sharply differed on the one-time settlement policy — 5th such intervention by successive governments over 25 years — to be unveiled by the Punjab government by

Bara saukha jeha elaaj hai... sarey hal ho jaan gey, das saal ess mulak cho votan hata deo (There is a simple solution… , do away with vote politics for 10 years, then everything will be solved). Can’t guarantee that the upcoming policy is the final settlement.-Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, housing and urban devp minister

July 7 for regularisation of unauthorised settlements in the state. The two ministers were speaking at a roundtable discussion, ‘The Mess Called Urban Planning’, organised by Hindustan Times on Tuesday. The panel that also included BJP leader and former local bodies minister Manoranjan Kalia, retired chief town planner Rajinder Sharma and former director town planning MS Aujla threw up a slew of suggestions during the 65-minute discussion moderated by Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak on the steps needed to stem the rot.

Q: HT to (Sidhu): Punjab is the sixth most urbanised state. This has led to haphazard growth and illegal colonies putting immense stress on urban infrastructure.

To put it succinctly, we have failed to prevent and prepare and we have always repented and repaired. The reason: This policy has not come for the first time, but for the fifth time in last 20 years. That means this is not a one-time settlement. It is a progressive settlement. The colonies are left open-ended. There is no closure certificate. Manifestos say this needs to be done for welfare of the poor on as-is-where-is basis. But if in the name of poor someone tries to do business, it cannot be termed as one-time settlement.

The basic question is why could we not replicate another Chandigarh? The capital city is an example if you look at roads, their width and open spaces. It is choice, not a chance that determines your destiny. What is the choice? Are you going to be facilitating those people who are doing planned development and develop 55% area and leave the rest for roads or those who are constructing 90% of area available to them and leave 10-foot wide roads? What is happening is that over a period of time, vote-bank politics has overshadowed planned development. There are more colonies than there is actual demand for. Agriculture land is shrinking. Also, planned developers are not being facilitated and those developing unapproved colonies sell their plots and run away. It is our duty to help poor people there. We must facilitate those standing last in the queue.

There is no mess in planning; mess is in urbanisation and implementation. Private colonisers were involved because the government was unable to cope up with the pressure for housing.-Rajinder Sharma, retd chief town planner

The previous (SAD-BJP) government got Rs 75 crore from the Prime Minister Awas Yojana and not a single house was constructed. The entire money was diverted. The Centre wants utilisation certificates, asking us where the money was spent. We are creating downtown situations for people. Let me give you an example from Zirakpur. When a poor man buys a plot in a locality with 10-foot wide streets due to affordability, he finds that the plot has been sold five times and he has been cheated. We don’t have inventories. We need to do satellite mapping to find out whether 40% area is occupied in a colony and poor people are living there. We are coming out with a foolproof method where we are going to involve resident welfare associations.

Q:(To Bajwa): In Punjab’s history, you are the first minister to have both urban development, housing and rural development. If illegal colonies are regularised, there will be a similar situation after five years. What is the long-term solution?

No one can take any guarantee that this is the final settlement. And, this should not even happen. The Constitution was drafted in 1950 and there have been so many amendments thereafter. There are changes in thinking and changes have to be made accordingly. At times, there are deficiencies in policies which have to be removed. We are talking to all stakeholders, including representatives of authorised colonies and unapproved colonies, before bringing out the policy. But, urbanisation is dynamic process. We can’t promise that the new policy on regularisation of unauthorised colonies will put a full stop on this trend. As for unplanned colonies, what we are dealing with did not happen in our time. Due to vote-bank politics, we made certain commitments in our manifesto and it is the duty of our party to fulfil those irrespective of whether it is right or wrong. This doesn’t mean that we are going to be unfair with ones developing planned colonies. What is unfortunate is that 80% of those developing authorised colonies also have unplanned constructions over 100 acres behind the planned colony in 10 acres. They try to take advantage on both sides. The cabinet will clear the policy by July 7. We will try that in our five years, we have just one settlement policy.

Q:(To Kalia) What is the reason for mushrooming of illegal colonies? What is the solution?

The urban planning department has failed to keep pace with the demand for planned colonies. Urban planning has not been carried out in accordance with the demand. If a person wants to build a house, he knows there is not much urban planning and opts for unapproved colony due to affordability and lack of proper basic amenities even in planned colonies. Secondly, the urban development department’s role is to facilitate planned colonies. But with the passage of time, it has become a revenue earning department. It is now a milch cow. Change of land use (CLU) and development charges are exorbitant. Housing has gone out of the reach of the common man. Also, laws such as the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA) are stringent and no illegal colony can come up. Yet, not a single person has been convicted till now. Only challans are filed. Then, one-time settlement is brought.

The new policy will put Rs 30,000 crore burden on fund-starved government to provide basic amenities in illegal colonies. Relax fees in legal colonies and involve genuine people in building houses.- MS Aujla, retd director town planning

The first one-time settlement was brought during the Beant Singh government in 1992. Before that, there was no proper urban planning for 10 years due to terrorism. When peace returned, there was a surge in demand, but we failed to cope with that and illegal colonies sprang up. When we bring one-time settlement policies, wrongdoer gets benefitted and is encouraged. Due to electoral compulsions, public representatives also invest in unplanned colonies. Ultimately, it becomes a riddle of sphinx. The solution lies in going for vertical construction. Carrot and stick policy has to be followed. CLU and development charges have to be reduced. This will bring down cost of housing.

PUDA took 12 years to start a master plan and it is still not complete. Once the master plan is finalised, there can be no change. But illegal colonies are still coming up in violation. The local bodies department gets burdened due to such one-time settlement policies. Under the Punjab Apartment Ownership Act, planned colonies are to be transferred to the local bodies department after seven years for upkeep. We need to do away with this clause. They should themselves maintain these colonies. We have to adopt a holistic approach. All over India, urban development and local bodies is one department. Punjab is the only exception. Then, there should be an amendment to define coloniser as a person whose name has been entered in revenue record in the column of owner. He should be caught as he has developed the illegal colony. Punjab is an agrarian state and fertile agriculture land around cities is being gobbled up by illegal colonies. That has to be checked. In addition, basic amenities should be provided in villages to check migration to urban areas.

Sidhu: For a permanent solution, there should be an inventory. We should know about open spaces, how many people live there and availability of infrastructure. We can send officials to check all these. What are the officials doing there? In Kasauli case, Supreme Court said that until 4-5 officials lose their jobs, this menace will not stop. They have government vehicle and fuel but they are running it like their own business. The money is going in their pockets. Powerful people build their own colonies. This is a never-ending process and needs to be checked.

Q:(To Aujla): When illegal colonies are regularised on payment of compounding fee, is the money thus collected invested for development of infrastructure?

Urbanisation is a dynamic process and has to take place. Amnesty can only be a one-time process. In case you are giving amnesty to a convict, you say he will not repeat the mistake. In this case, we have failed to identify the offender. By way of illegal colonies, we are creating bad living environment and unhygienic conditions. In case you regularise that, it will cause permanent damage to socio-economic development of Punjab. In fact, the regularisation policy of 2013 opened floodgates to haphazard urban development, befitting private colonisers. Once done, no amount of funds or commitment can retrieve the situation and make the cities liveable and sustainable. Further, it is going to create a whopping new financial liability of Rs 25,000 to 30,000 crore for the already fund-starved government to provide basic services (internal and external) in 50,000 acres under illegal colonies.

Q:(To Sharma): Earlier, the housing department and PUDA used to develop colonies which were later given to private colonisers. Do you think the shift from government to private sector has led to messy development?

It is a combination of many things. Punjab is one of the best states in planning. It has the best master plans if compared with other states. A Singapore-based company has drafted seven master plans. There is no mess in

Vested interests are overriding the interest of state and parallel power centres are trying to make it right when they are wrong. I will not accept that. Punjab needs to put a full-stop on illegal colonies, once and for all. We cannot have an open-ended settlement (policy).-Navjot Singh Sidhu, local bodies minister

planning. The rot is in urbanisation, development and implementation. Private colonisers were involved as there was pressure that the government was not able to handle it. Earlier, the subsidy was given on small plots to the poor and Chandigarh adopted the same pattern. We missed that in the urbanisation of Punjab. We try to sell big chunks of plots and the poor are being pushed to the periphery. As urban development schemes are not affordable, the poor had to move to unauthorised colonies. The one-time settlement is not a legal solution. Only a colony that fits in the laid rules can be regularised.

Bajwa: Amnesty can’t be given only once. Development is done keeping in view the requirements of the given times. How can we stop owners from building houses on their agriculture land? The process is ever-evolving. We must learn from the past.

Kalia: We need multi-level planning. We can have wide roads in a colony for affluent, and have small houses with a 20-foot-wide road for the middle class.

Q:(To Bajwa): Bureaucratic red tape, corruption, lengthy procedures and hefty fee is blamed for illegal colonies.

I don’t agree. We can’t put entire onus on officials. Government hikes charges under compulsion of revenue generation. An official would register property at whatever rate fixed by the government. Villages should be developed to stop migration to cities.

Q :(To Sidhu): Do we need simplified procedures to stop illegal colonies?

To develop a colony, we need electricity poles, sewerage system, roads, and then external development. By an average, we need Rs 70 lakh to Rs 1 crore per acre for development. We have 40,000 acres of unauthorised colonies to be developed, and revenue we plan to raise is Rs 700 crore. Who would pay us the balance Rs 30,000 crore. Then onus of development is pushed on local bodies department. It is going to make situation not bad , but worse. The solution is to go upward at a new site. If we do it on existing colonies, it would choke the existing

Wrong is when we use political power for doing wrong. Revenue department is the main culprit. Implement the laws in letter and spirit to stop illegal colonies. Then, there will be no need for regulsarisation policy every then and now. --Manoranjan Kalia, senior BJP leader and former local bodies minister

infrastructure. A city for two lakh people is inhabited by 15 lakh people. It’s obvious that sewers will choke. We need stringent norms. Those doing planned development should be rewarded and those not be punished.

Q:Why master plans have no sanctity in Punjab?

Sharma: The problem is of enforcement, we have laws but not the will.

Bajwa: There’s lack of staff.

Aujla: Extending limits of municipal bodies is leading to mess.

Sidhu: I am bringing a clause in the policy whereby officials will be dismissed if any building comes up after March 31. Things will not change till the cabinet passes the policy.

Q: In Punjab, politicians are becoming real estate developers, and developers are becoming politicians. Is it creating vested interest and hurdles in development?

Kalia: Definitely...

Sidhu: This is true. Vested interest is overriding the interest of state and parallel power centres try to make it right when they are wrong, I will not accept that. It is in the interest of the state to make inventory of colonies. Superimpose “khasra” number on master plans and we would immediately know where the fault lies.

Bajwa: We can’t stop politicians to become real estate developers, but they should do it in the purview of laid procedures and laws.

Kalia: Wrong is when we use political power for doing wrong. Revenue department has a major role to play. A map is made and plots are cut which gets registered with the revenue department – here is the need to check. The revenue department is the main culprit and must be taken to task. There must be coordination between revenue and housing departments. No objection certificates from the local bodies department should be made mandatory for electricity connection for a residential house.

Sharma: Why and how are we entertaining registry of small plots on agriculture land? Electricity connection should not be given to a person not owning a regularised plot. If we shift overhead electricity wires underground and give good drainage system, the cities of Punjab will on its own become smart.

Bajwa: I will go for rainwater harvesting in villages, and will begin from Sidhu saab’s village.

Q: (To Bajwa): The government is going to regularise illegal colonies and will unveil the policy on July 7. With this, scrupulous people who own plots in legal colonies will feel cheated and those in unplanned in colonies will be benefitted. Any concessions for the genuine plot owners?

We have spoken to representative of both unauthorised and authorised colony owners. We are taking a balanced view. We don’t want legal developers to avoid thinking Punjab has a different system. In the new policy, developers of authorized colonies will feel Punjab is a good destination and those think to come up with illegal colonies in future will feel discouraged.

Q: Why can’t the state government play a proactive role in the housing sector?

Sidhu: We are touching this issue in the new policy. We have acquired a land pool of 6,000 acres near Mohali. We can’t demolish old cities, but can build a new in a planned manner. The illegal colonies being regularised will cause a problem for 20 years as there is no demand for housing.

Kalia: The acquisition policy has stringent norms, by which the government had to pay double the price of land acquired for urbanisation. It becomes difficult to do this way. The government can only act as a facilitator, and can cut down on charges.

Bajwa: Our new township will overshadow the smart city projects. People from Amritsar and Ludhiana will see our Mohali project and will replicate it. We want to set an example on 6,000 acres.

Sidhu: The concept of land pooling is to make farmer who owns the land a stakeholder.

Bajwa: The new policy will give share in commercial and residential properties to the farmer.

Q: (To Kalia) Do you agree that regularisation can only be a one-time affair, keeping in view the fact that when the new government comes, there is another regularisation policy.

It is because of non-implementation of laws. After the one-time settlement, if we follow law in latter and in spirit, new illegal colonies can’t come up."

Updated: Jun 26, 2018 16:31 IST

Actor Swara Bhasker is perhaps one of the most politically aware celebrities on social media. She is always ready with an opinion on almost everything that’s happening in the country. This is also the reason why she finds herself in a lot of controversies, most of the time.

Asked if anyone from Bollywood has ever advised her against being so outspoken, Swara says, “I think I am a little too unguarded! A lot of people, who are well-wishers do tell me sometimes, ‘You should be a little careful’. I always feel grateful because they are coming from a place of concern.”

She adds, “I could learn a little, definitely. I am not saying that I am perfect, but I think it is [an important] advice that I could probably listen to.” However, the actor doesn’t regret [being herself] even one bit.

“[The majority of] things that I have commented on, I have not said [or commented on them] unthinkingly. I think that I normally say something when I believe in it, and that’s why I don’t take my statements back. I will always stand by what I say, because it’s not coming from a place of ill intention or impulsiveness. It comes from a belief in something [ideologies, principles, etc.],” says Swara.

With such strong views on political issues, does she see or ever contemplate entering politics? “I am still considering my Bollywood career! (laughs) so I would like to spend many years here before I do anything else in life.”

Swara recently delivered one of her biggest hits, Veere Di Wedding with Sonam K Ahuja and Kareena Kapoor Khan. Sonam had recently said that she wants to direct Swara in her directorial debut, whenever that happens. Swara’s reaction on this? “Wow!” she says before taking a second to say something further. “She has, of course, told me that she wants to become a director, and she has a good idea [for a movie] also. I am absolutely convinced Sonam would make an absolutely fantastic director. She has a great vision and understanding,” she says.

Updated: Jun 12, 2018 09:49 IST

In the adivasi village of Manachamba, Maharashtra, hooked to a solar microgrid since January, a gaggle of five women shyly list their newfound freedoms. Their evening kitchen work, formerly done on a kerosene-lit mud lamp, now happens under a bright bulb. This means fewer accidents, and more time. Thanks to the solar-lit streetlights, they can go out in the early hours of the morning without fearing snakes and scorpions. Children can study longer and into the night. They don’t have the money now, but the hope is they will soon have a fan, and then, a mixer-grinder. And they speak for long hours to their distant families over their fully charged phones.

According to Debojit Palit, of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), based on surveys in the Sunderbans region, a major factor influencing the inclusion of women in the family decision-making process is one simple change – greater access to mobile phones. Before they got electricity, women were dependent on the men for charging their phones in markets.

In Karnataka, thanks to a predominance of chutneys on the menu, the grinder gets top priority, says Sameer Nair of Gram Oorja. According to activist Sunanda Patwardhan, in the adivasi hamlets of Mokhada, Jawhar, the ability to install an electric pump for water and a UV filtration device has reduced illnesses by 80%. And for widowed or abandoned women, along with the elderly, the village collectively pays a cover charge and subsidises their tariff, reduced to around Rs 15 a month.

Twenty-one-year-old Manisha Anand Tawad from Tundepada manages the fenced-in solar microgrid for her hamlet. The energy committee unanimously elected her because she is meticulous. She maintains records of the 30 households’ meter readings, ensures cattle, children and villagers don’t venture near it, and even makes collections. A few villages away, the grid is caked with dust, and left untended by its male caretaker. It will have reduced capacity; hers won’t. Confident and efficient, she is just one of a growing number of women taking charge of microgrids.

Lydia Powell, energy and climate change expert with the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), says women have traditionally formed part of the disadvantaged subgroups shut out of the electrification access.

“The driver for electrification in India was never households, it was always food production, for irrigation pumps in fields, so it was always out of women’s reach. If you look at living rooms, the utilities that men use — appliances, televisions, mobiles —they are in the 21st century for the most part, but kitchens, where women are located, have remained in the 19th century,” she said.

Palit attributes the rise of women as microgrid managers to institutional interventions by organisations such as Gram Oorja and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which now have an estimated 1,000-1,200 microgrids in densely forested areas — the highest penetration in India — men remain largely in charge. One state that beats the norm is Bihar, where women in self-help groups (SHGs), sparked by the Jeevika programme, naturally take over.

According to Jeevika’s CEO Balamurugan, the largest impact of SHGs has been building confidence and decision-making capability. This reflects in the solar grid management as well.

This also has to do with male pattern labour migration, which occurs on large scale here, leaving a substantial number of “left-behind” women (the term is rejected by experts who choose not to see them as victims), but the subject of study by Dr Anamika Priyadarshini at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Patna, in collaboration with Adithi, a local women’s organisation observing the phenomenon in areas such as Sitamarhi).

The new upgrade in women’s access to electricity tells a new story about the primary beneficiaries of last-mile electrification. The first impact is on the home, on children’s studies, on the kitchen, on domestic affairs – time of sleeping, eating, waking up, and the efficiency of household chores.

But these activities are largely viewed as “women’s work”.

If women are able to take control of microgrids, it is not because any hierarchical changes have occurred within households, Powell says, but because of the international or corporate donor component that pushes for gender equality and makes women the most important beneficiaries of electricity.

Independent microgrids require villages or hamlets to form committees that take charge of the grids. Where institutions insist on women’s representation, they take the posts of president, treasurer and registrar.

However, the one or two men on the panel, typically young, are recruited to go and make bank deposits, file complaints, run errands, and so on.

In remote villages, with NGO-formed panels, this women-driven exercise is more equitable and visibly empowering. However, in the larger panchayats, which require state-mandated women’s representation, there can be tokenism. Here, women may hold posts, but are often overruled by the men. In hamlets that are remote, economic activity is minimal, thanks to basic kilowatt capacity. The grids do not run irrigation pumps for the fields, or commercial machinery yet. This leaves the men disinterested in their operations.

Aparna Katre, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota at Duluth, and a social entrepreneurship researcher, and Arianna Tozzi, a researcher in renewable and sustainable energy and gender, were looking at the sustainability of Gram Oorja’s work when they discovered an emerging pattern in women’s engagement.

They studied 24 grids and 40 solar water pumping cases. In some, the village energy committee was fully operated by women (in Gumla, Jharkhand and one site in Jawhar).

In others, women had about 40-50% representation, held key positions in the committee and were actively involved in decision-making processes. In other cases, women participation in governance was either symbolic or missing.

“We also found that in the first case the governance was more effective as regards timely decisions, conducting periodic meetings, seeking inputs from the villagers, with billing and collections, and maintaining records,” Katre said.

Katre finds that institutional intervention has provided that key push for 50% representation of women and typically begins during the early stages of mobilisation. “The arguments presented to the villagers are those of equity and women benefit equally if not more from the electricity and water supply, and therefore must be responsible for its governance. Of course, this is not a rule and therefore we found lot of variation. The decision of the nature and extent of women’s involvement was ultimately that of the entire village. What we found interesting was that the role of plant operator was officially with men. However, since men migrate seasonally for labour work, the role was being performed by a woman, often the plant operator’s wife. Here, the gendered perceptions of the role were almost non-existent,” Katre said.

According to the researchers’ findings, access to basic electricity got children got 0.7 hours a day to study, women reported improvement in indoor air quality, the improvement in eyesight and respiratory diseases was 60%, the women surveyed felt 92% safer, children felt 85% safer, accidents reduced by 67%, women felt 83% more connected with the outside world, and community activities in the village rose 34%. Once electricity was sufficient to install water pumps and filtration devices, health and sanitation improved 95-96%.

Findings of the microgrid survey

In Bihar, United National Development Programme (UNDP) environment officer Deepak Kumar has been touring Jeevika’s solar microgrids in Badal Bigha, and Barsha Pippara villages in Tankuppa.

Here, women have been going beyond maintenance of the grid to actively negotiating and reviewing pricing slabs. They supervise and recommend the installation of solar drip irrigation pump sets.

Transparency is one of the key factors that influences operations here, says Kumar. Women keep discussions open to the village, are meticulous about maintaining records, and work towards the larger good of the community, looking at raising incomes.

This leads to less bias in distribution and greater efficiency in hiring technical labour.

At Barsha Pippara, which is in a Naxal-prone belt, Central Economics Limited installed a plant as part of its CSR project that reaches 200 households with two centralised powerhouses of 15KW each. Here, consensus has been hard to come by, with the menfolk arguing that they shouldn’t have to pay for government electricity, and no agreement has been reached on minimal charges.

Without the intervention of women, Kumar says, the grid wouldn’t have become operational and sustainable.

“With 50% representation in local self-government, women self-help groups in clusters are working to invite stakeholders in solar microgrid installation and have set up incubation centres. But institutional intervention alone doesn’t explain rising involvement. Women are efficient and acquire the expertise and technical skill to manage grids. There is a paradigm shift at the Gram Panchayat level. They manage, monitor and marshal not only solar microgrids but the surplus power generated and transmitted to the central grid. They are working to set up solar micro-irrigation pumps, solar roof-tops and other forms of renewable energy generation. They understand the dynamics of profit and commercialisation. I find the SHGs bringing out the innate entrepreneurial spirit in women” he said.

Women have also proven vital to the long-term sustainability of microgrids. In villages considered India’s first solar grid models, such as Dharnai, where microgrids were set up by Greenpeace and were subsequently connected to the conventional grid as well, villagers often distanced themselves when free or subsidised electricity access ended.

Kumar says that without the sense of community ownership, models for microgrids, no matter how high-functioning, are bound to eventually fail.

Women are the key factors in holding together communities, over political, social, caste rifts, and mobilising the current.

If that’s not true power, then what is?"

Updated: Jun 02, 2018 10:39 IST

At a recent panel discussion to launch a book of essays by senior lawyer and Congress spokesperson, Abhishek Singhvi, I pushed the speakers to define what “secularism” is. Singhvi’s introductory chapter identifies secularism as the first principle of Indian democracy. As a philosophical notion of diversity and a constitutional guarantee of equality, of course I entirely agree. It is what makes India unique and wonderful.

But I was more interested in exploring whether it still holds as a marker of political differentiation. Hasn’t secularism become corroded and compromised as an electoral slogan?

Dinesh Trivedi of the Trinamool Congress retorted — rather candidly — “This secularism debate is all politics.” He wasn’t dissing the idea of religious pluralism which he said was innate to India; his remark was on the electoral squabble over the word.

But perhaps nothing illustrates the fact that the old political silos no longer apply than the meeting between his party’s boss Mamata Banerjee and the Shiva Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray. Unlike his father, Uddhav is someone I have often described as “the reluctant fundamentalist”. But notwithstanding his seeming discomfort with the traditional militant parochialism of his party, it would be hard for anyone to call the Sena a secular force. Yet, an unfazed West Bengal chief minister said she “respects Shiv Sena; no one is more communal than the BJP”. Since then, Uddhav has become an unlikely rallying force for the anti-Modi federal front, even though he hasn’t yet left the alliance with the BJP in Maharashtra.

The message is clear: the rhetoric notwithstanding, in the run-up to 2019, the pivot around which the non-BJP parties will organise themselves will be regionalism and federalism — and not secularism. The anti-Narendra Modi sentiment among these state satraps is higher than an anti-BJP ideology per se. In any case, most of the regional political protagonists have had alliances and understandings with the BJP in the past. Naveen Patnaik, Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar, Mayawati, N Chandrababu Naidu, K Chandrasekhar Rao have all either been in alliance with the BJP or showered praise on its leadership at different points of time.

Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal United — stung by three consecutive losses to the Tejashwi Yadav-led RJD — has begun to murmur its disenchantment with the BJP, amid rumours that a faction could split under Sharad Yadav. In fact, nothing better represents the demise of secularism as a meaningful political slogan more than the Bihar chief minister’s fickleness. Nitish was hailed by liberals as a secular alternative to Modi. Last year, before Nitish walked into the arms of the BJP, historian Ramachandra Guha suggested that the Congress back Nitish as its prime ministerial candidate. “He is a leader without a party,” Guha told me,” and the Congress is a party without a leader.” But neither Nitish’s alliance with the BJP, nor his second exit, should it come later this year, will have anything to do with secularism or an antithetical ideology. His decisions will be a by-product of realpolitik.

The Opposition’s win in Kairana has offered a ready blueprint for what lies ahead — alliances, arithmetic and an attempt to make the elections as local as Modi will try and make them presidential. On this chessboard of moves — and despite Jayant Chaudhary’s memorable winning line — Ganna, not Jinnah — the organising principle of the arrangement of power will be regional blocs, caste calculations and the cementing of anti-Modi calculations. Don’t be surprised if the Shiv Sena joins such a federal front officially revealing that the old rules of secularism have changed. No one is a political pariah any more. And the traditional notions of Left vs Right have collapsed.

The party that will be hurt the most by the ascent of regional forces and their localised identities will be the Congress. For years the Congress has argued that the fundamental difference between it and the BJP is that it is secular. But now — unless wins in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh can tilt the scales — the Congress not just has to play second fiddle in a rainbow coalition of regional parties; it also has to accept that these state forces will set the narrative. Most likely the political fault line in 2019 will be Hindutva vs Caste disruptions.

The Congress displayed its confusion on the secularism issue by showing visible anxiety about the Right-wing labelling it anti-Hindu and pro-Muslim. It’s slightly vague attempt to be Hindu Lite to the BJP’s hard Hindutva hasn’t got it significant gains yet. As it wraps its head around how best to define a new version of secularism — different from the Nehruvian ideal — the regional parties have bypassed the question altogether.

Updated: May 22, 2018 11:36 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the rupee face a similar predicament -- old foes have re-emerged to keep them in check.

Brent crude rose above $80 a barrel last week for the first time since 2014, and is looking ominous for the nation’s budget deficit, inflation and the currency. Meanwhile, Modi faces the prospect of rival parties uniting to block his re-election bid after their success at a recent state poll.

Together, elevated oil prices and political uncertainty have sent the rupee 3% below the year-end analyst consensus targets, and some strategists expect the currency to weaken past a 2016 record low of 68.8650 per dollar. The combination couldn’t have come at a worse time, with rising Treasury yields spurring a selldown of emerging markets.

“Bouncing oil prices will add to India’s inflation woes and intensify market concern over the nation’s trade and current-account deficits,” said Qi Gao, a Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank. He expects the currency to head toward 69 per dollar. The forecast is in the ballpark of the 69.63-to-70 range priced in by the onshore and offshore forwards markets.

Every $10 rise in the oil price worsens India’s current-account balance by 0.4% of GDP, pushes up inflation by 30-40 basis points, and hurts growth by about 15 basis points, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.

The currency rose 15 paise against the US dollar to 67.97, paring some losses. The consensus forecast is for the rupee to trade at 66 by the fourth quarter, and even the most bearish of analysts like Westpac Banking Corp. had only seen the rupee at 68.5, the estimates show.

FX intervention

Further weakness in the currency could hurt capital inflows and pressure the current account deficit, said Aditya Pugalia, Dubai-based director of financial markets at Emirates NBD PJSC. Global funds have pulled $3.5 billion from Indian bonds so far this year, while flows into equities have shrunk to under $600 million after withdrawals of $1.6 billion since April 1.

The Reserve Bank of India probably burned through $8.4 billion of reserves in the four weeks through May 11 to halt the drop, data from the central bank show. Investors should expect more measures, including monetary tightening, according to RBC Capital Markets LLC.

“All tools are on the table, including regular FX intervention, other market operations and monetary policy,” said Sue Trinh, a strategist at RBC Capital in Hong Kong. She expects the rupee to trade at 65.20 to a dollar by the year-end.

The uncertainty spurred by an election-heavy year is also taking a toll. The outcome of this month’s poll in Karnataka, where the BJP was outsmarted by an opposition alliance despite securing the most seats, raised the prospect of rivals uniting to keep the ruling party out at the national ballot in 2019.

“While we do not expect a 2013-style panic (taper tantrum), the rupee performance could be constrained by concerns over increased fiscal spending ahead of state elections,” Nomura analysts including Craig Chan wrote, noting that the next key state elections aren’t due until late in 2018."

Eight months ago, Md Shahid Siddiquee,32, a former student of Aligarh Muslim University, was a newcomer in All India Forward Bloc, a partner in Bengal’s Left coalition.

When results to the polls in the state’s three-tier panchayats were released, Siddiquee emerged as winner of the sole zilla parishad (district council) seat for the Marxists who were facing rout.

The Urdu teacher at Dharmapur High School at Goalpokhar in Bengal’s North Dinajpur district won from Belon in Goalpokhar 2 block. This is the Left’s only zilla parishad seat out of 825 (only 622 saw contest) in Bengal. Siddiquee defeated veteran Trinamool Congress leader Abdul Ghani by 1,156 votes.

Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India and Revolutionary Socialist Party, the three other big constituents of the 10-party Left Front, could not win any seat in the highest tier of the panchayats.

Interestingly, Siddiquee is not even known to many of the top Left leaders in these parties. He will be introduced to them at a meeting of the Left Front leaders on May 26.

Siddiquee joined politics eight months ago after he was inspired by Ali Imran Ramz, Forward Bloc MLA from Chakulia in North Dinajpur district. Ramz is the second youngest MLA in the Bengal assembly.

“I was always a Forward Bloc supporter but it was Ramz who inspired me to join active politics. He also inspired me to contest. The credit for my victory goes to him,” said Siddiquee.

“Had Trinamool supporters not resorted to violence at eight booths our margin would have been higher. But I am sure many Trinamool supporters also voted for me,” he added.

Ramz claimed that Siddiquee’s victory has proved that Left Front can put up a fight against Trinamool if it keeps in touch with people at the grassroots. “From the very beginning I was against seat adjustment with any party outside the Left Front. In North Dinajpur, Forward Bloc contested on its own. I am grateful to our voters,” said Ramz.

CPI(M) Politburo member and MP from Raigunj in North Dinajpur, MP Salim, said the Left would have done much better in the north Bengal region had Trinamool not resorted to violence."

What was the Karnataka mandate for? And what was it against? It’s important to answer these questions even as the controversy over the governor’s invitation to BS Yeddyurappa to form the government rages.

The mandate was not for the Congress, which was the party in power and ended up with 78 seats in the 224-member house (that, and the fact that a little over half the Cabinet lost, means it was a mandate against the Congress). The mandate was not for the JD(S), which won 38 seats (including one that its partner, the BSP, won). And the mandate was not even for the BJP, which won 104 seats.

In a first past the post system, the party with the required majority gets to form the government. In Karnataka’s case that number is 112 (elections were not held to two seats; if they had been, the required number would have been 113). If no party ends up with a majority, and there is no pre-poll alliance, then the question of who gets to form the government usually ends up being a function of two things: the ability of the parties to form alliances or get enough legislators to abstain to ensure they pass a floor test on majority; and the discretion of the governor.

The Karnataka governor decided to invite the single largest party, the BJP, whose leader, Mr Yeddyurappa, staked his claim to form the government — which means he expressed his confidence of proving his majority on the floor of the house. Meanwhile, the Congress decided to support the JD(S), which means there was a post-poll grouping with the requisite numbers (this combine has 116; 117, counting the ephemeral support of an independent legislator who has changed his mind several times already). The governor chose to ignore the claim of this alliance, though, prompting the Congress to reach out to the Supreme Court. The court will hear the case on Friday.

Irrespective of which way the court decides, there are two disturbing aspects of this drama. The first is that by explicitly ignoring the claim of the Congress-JD(S), and giving the BJP 15 days to prove its majority, the governor, while not breaking any laws, does seem to have exercised his discretion to the advantage of one party. This has happened before (and will probably happen again), but since governors are expected to be above politics, it makes sense to place this on the record each time it does.

The second is that, relatively speaking, the BJP does have more of a mandate to govern than either the Congress and the JD(S), and by supporting the chief ministerial candidature of a party with a mere 38 legislators, the Congress is definitely subverting the verdict. Again, this has happened before (and will probably happen again).

In politics, clearly, there is unanimity among parties of all hues that the ends justify the means."

Updated: May 16, 2018 17:03 IST

Japan’s parliament on Wednesday passed a law to encourage female candidates to stand for elections in a country where women are vastly underrepresented in politics.

Under the new law, political parties are urged to make the number of male and female candidates as equal as possible and are encouraged to set targets for gender parity. But the law includes no penalties for parties that fail to do so, nor incentives to encourage them.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made increasing female participation in the workforce a key plank of his economic policies as Japan struggles with a labour shortage. But only 47 of the 465 members of parliament’s lower house are women, a ratio of 10.1 percent that puts Japan behind Myanmar and Gambia in terms of female government representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

“I hope this law will make a big change in Japanese politics,” said Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda, one of the members who drafted the legislation, according to public broadcaster NHK.

“I hope women who were hesitant to become candidates will be courageous” and run for election, she said.

The law was put forward by a cross-party group of lawmakers, but reportedly faced opposition during the drafting process despite containing no penalties for non-compliance. Next year Japan will hold regional elections in April and elections for parliament’s upper house in July.

Japan ranked bottom among G7 countries in the World Economic Forum’s latest “Global Gender Gap Report”, coming 114th worldwide."

Vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu said on Monday religion and politics should not be mixed and suggested that religious leaders give spiritual guidance while politicians should take inspiration from the country’s noble heritage to provide a clear polity.

He was speaking at a civic reception organised in honour of Dr Philipose Mar Chrysostom, Valiya Metropolitan of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church on his 101st birthday and the diamond jubilee celebrations of Holy Ordination of the Most Rev Dr Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan in Thiruvalla, Kerala.

“I hope these two strands -- religion and politics- are not mixed up and religious leaders give spiritual guidance to every human being and political leaders take inspiration from our noble heritage to provide a clean polity”, Naidu said.

Religious shrines are places of devotion and potentially sites of social and community education, he said, adding that if they stray from their path and dabble in politics and issue unwarranted divisive statements, they become dysfunctional.

Naidu also said it was time to nourish and re-discover a positive energy, a source of harmony, understanding, respect, a perennial fountain head of the timeless values that India has stood for.

Lauding the contribution of Philipose Mar Chrystostam, Naidu said he showered his blessings through good humour and pleasant demeanour.

Chrystostam internalised the essence of Christianity and propagated its tenets through his words and actions, he added.

Naidu said the Mar Thoma Church, with deep roots in the history of Independent India, has always stood for freedom and justice and recalled its protest against the Emergency.

PJ Kurian, Rajya Sabha deputy chairman and state minister for water resources Mathew T Thomas were among those attended the function.

Chrysostom, known for his pleasant attitude and humorous speeches, holds modern views and effortlessly mingles with the youth.

He still leads an active life, meeting people and attending functions as the senior metropolitan.

He was conferred the Padma Bhushan this year."

West Bengal’s ruling party has achieved a unique feat. A fortnight before polling day, it has won more than one-third of the seats in the forthcoming rural polls. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has won 34.2% of the 58,692 seats in the three-tier panchayat structure, setting an electoral record. After the withdrawal of nominations, the party won 34.56% of the seats at the gram panchayat level; 33.18% at the panchayat samiti level; and 24.6% at the zilla parishad tier. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s party also won as many as four zilla parishads (district councils) out of 20.

The rural polls are crucial for parties to assert their hold and power at the grassroots level. The run up to the polls have been marked by bitter acrimony and large-scale violence as the BJP tries to increase its footprint in Bengal and the TMC does whatever it can to hold on to the power it has. Panchayats have been hailed as an optimum model for decentralising administration. In Bengal, it has also become a model for decentralisation of muscle power. Even before nominations began at 11 am on April 2, young men on motorcycles, armed with sticks and swords, were seen outside block development and sub divisional offices where nomination papers were to be submitted. The idea was to prevent opposition candidates from even filing nominations.

Over the next few days, every weapon of intimidation, from phone calls to crude bombs and firearms were freely deployed. The result: even the record of the formidable Left front — it won a maximum of 11% of the total seats uncontested in 2003 — paled before the Trinamool juggernaut. Usually, the percentage of seats won uncontested has been in single digits.

More may be in store on May 14, the day of polling. The state has 58,476 booths and just about 81,000 policemen, including about 6,500 government railway police and 12,000 police without firearms. The State Election Commission settled for single-day polling schedule after Ms Banerjee insisted that elections should be held before the Ramzan month (likely to begin on May 16). In 2013, the rural poll was held in five phases, all during the month when many Muslims fast between dawn and dusk.

The government is spending Rs 360 crore on rural elections this year. That is without budgeting for the cost of millions of man-days. The cynical view is, the money could have been better spent — the estimated expenditure for the polls is almost 40% of the budgetary allocation of Rs 905 crore for backward classes welfare. Worse, with a third of the seats won without a contest, the process has turned into a travesty."

It has been close to four months after the violence at Bhima Koregaon near Pune but the dust hasn’t settled down and politics from both sides are peaking.

The alleged suicide of a 19-year-old girl and the subsequent police action of arresting two persons among the nine booked on the charges of abetment to suicide and Prevention of Atrocities Act has once again escalated the tension in Bhima Koregaon and the adjoining villages. The deceased had witnessed her house being burnt during the violence on January 1,2018.

According to the police, the two persons who were arrested, have a legal dispute going on with girl’s family over construction on a piece of plot, next to their house. The body of Pooja, a class XI student, was recovered from a well, a day after she went missing.

On April 17, Pune Police carried out searches at the residence of eight persons in connection with the offences related to alleged inflammatory statements made by Kabir Kala Manch singers at the Elgaar Parishad ( conference ) at historic Shaniwarwada on December 31. Kabir Kala Manch is a left-leaning cultural organisation.

Both the Dalit organisations and the right-wing groups have been trading charges, ever since the violence broke out in the area.

Amid charges and counter charges, a number of so-called ‘fact finding’ committees have brought out their reports. On Tuesday, Vivek Vichar Manch, a RSS affiliated think tank released its report on the Bhima Koregaon riots alleging that the police had misled the government on the prevalent situation and demanded action against senior police officials for their acts of negligence. The report also gave clean chit to Hindutva organisation, Shiv Pratishtan Hindustan, who were accused of instigating the riots.

BATTLE GROUND: BHIMA KOREGAON Ever since a fateful turn of events on January 1, 2018, the Battle of Koregaon Bhima has moved from being a celebration for the Dalits to a war that is slowly, but surely, evolving. The alleged suicide by Pooja Sakat, 19, on April 22, has once again lit a match on burning embers that will not die down A tale of celebration, violence and strife DEC 31, 2017: The Elgaar Parishad conference was held on December 31 at Pune’s historic Shaniwarwada, the headquarters of the Peshwas.

The report has blamed Maoist organisations and other outfits for the January 1 violence.

“The violence was orchestrated by outfits inclined to the Maoist ideology and those falsifying history to create tension in the society,” stated the report. After the release of report, Rawat blamed Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar for working for the cause of Maoists. “Prakash Ambedkar must not aid Maoists and instead, should focus on empowering the Dalits,” said Rawat.

Meanwhile, Ambedkar has continued to blame Hindutva organisations for the violence while also accusing the state BJP government of shielding the right-wing leaders such as Sambhaji Bhide who was booked by police but was not arrested.

Regarding the recent searches carried out by the Pune Police at the residence of Kabir Kala Manch members, Prakash Ambedkar said, “the searches carried out by the police for naxal links were in fact intended to protect the Hindutva leader Sambhaji Bhide and destroy evidence against him.”

Following the violence, police filed multiple FIRs against Hindutva leaders as well as on the members of the left-leaning organisations such as Kabir Kala Manch and Jignesh Mevani, Gujrat MLA . Another right-wing leader Milind Ekbote was also booked and arrested in the case.

On April 7, Dalit victims from Sanaswadi and Koregaon Bhima held a media conference in Pune and alleged that a silent social boycott of the riot-affected Dalits were underway in the areas and police was not taking strong action against the accused who had destroyed their properties, set them on fire and threatened them with dire consequences. Interestingly, victim Pooja Sakat’s brother Jaideep was also present in the conference and had alleged that the lives of his family members was under threat from some local villagers.

Similarly, deceased Rahul Fatangale cousin Tejas Dhawade has demanded the arrest of the ten accused in the murder case and blamed police inaction behind the delay in arrest. Dhawade also alleged that the state government had not taken the intelligence reports into consideration, which led to Bhima Koregaon violence.

Earlier, deputy mayor Siddhartha Dhende has claimed that a fact-finding committee on Bhima Koregaon riots constituted by the inspector general of police, Vishwas Nangre Patil of which he was a member had come to conclusion that Bhima Koregaon riots were pre-planned and radical Hindutva elements had conspired and targeted the Dalits as a part of the larger conspiracy. “The local police also failed miserably in maintaining the law and order. There was a significant amount of prior information about the event available with the police but the police did not take necessary action which could have averted the riots,” Dhende claimed.

The above said report was termed to be misleading and wrong by Nangre Patil who said that the state government will issue a clarification in the issue.

Updated: Apr 26, 2018 09:45 IST

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday lashed out at the Devendra Fadnavis-government in Maharashtra, and called it ‘useless’.

Demanding a full-time home minister for the state, he slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government over the law and order situation in the state after two Sena leaders were murdered in Ahmednagar district.

Fadnavis also holds the home portfolio.

The Sena chief, who visited the families of the two Sena leaders in Ahmednagar on Wednesday, said his party had been demanding a full-time home minister in the state. Speaking to reporters in Ahmednagar, Thackeray said, “I understand that the chief minister is busy with his development work, so he would not have time for the complaints of the people. We have been demanding a full-time home minister for long.”

Sanjay Kotkar, deputy chief of Shiv Sena in Ahmednagar, and Vasant Thube, a party leader, were killed after being shot and attacked with sharp weapons on April 7. Nine people have been booked in connection with the murders. They include a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA and a Congress corporator. “The Fadnavis-led government is useless; the situation in Maharashtra is worse than Bihar. The state needs a full-time home minister,” Thackeray added. He added that an “independent inquiry” should be carried out in the case.

Thackeray demanded that the accused should be given a death penalty. “The state should appoint Ujjwal Nikam as the prosecutor in the case. I have personally spoken to Nikam regarding this.” He added that whichever party the accused may belong to, they should be given the strictest punishment.

The Sena chief demanded that the BJP “put an end to hooliganism”. He said if the BJP “follows the mantra of inducting criminals in the party to wrest power, there will be no ‘acche din’ in the country and the state”.

He handed over a cheque of Rs15.50 lakh each to the two families of the victims."

Updated: Apr 18, 2018 18:16 IST

Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday spoke against linking rapes with politics, in an obvious reference to the protests over recent incidents of sexual assault and murder in Uttar Pradesh and Jammu.

He was addressing a gathering at the launch of the Atal Amrit Abhiyaan, a health assurance initiative of the Assam government, during a visit to Guwahati.

Naidu, who is on a three-day tour of Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur, also said that merely bringing in a new bill will not stem instances of violence against women in the country. “The mindset needs to change,” he stated. “There should be stringent implementation of the law by the state governments concerned.”

The rape-cum-murder of an eight-year-old child allegedly by right-wing activists at Kathua in Jammu and the alleged sexual assault of an Unnao resident by BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar have put the ruling NDA government on the backfoot. BJP-ruled Assam has also witnessed a spike in crime against women in recent months. Residents of the state took out a series of protests after the brutal rape-cum- murder of a Class 5 student at Nagaon in March.

In what seemed to be a veiled reference to the recent Dalit protests against a Supreme Court order, Naidu then went on to denounce “those trying to create controversies on the basis of caste and religion” in the country. “They believe it is a shortcut to power. We should be careful about these people,” he said, but refrained from naming any political party.

Naidu expressed his appreciation for a recent Asian Development Bank report predicting a 7.6% growth rate for India, but maintained that all sections of the society should be a part of this success story. Stressing on inclusive growth, he called upon the central and state governments to focus on bridging the rural-urban divide, poverty alleviation and eliminating illiteracy irrespective of caste, religion or any other consideration."

Explanations of the Donald Trump phenomenon often start with conservatives versus liberals, the rural-urban split, or perhaps race and immigration. All those play a role, but the accumulation of evidence is validating a hypothesis from New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: a big and very fundamental split in American electoral politics today is between different understandings of sex and gender relations.

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center, Millennial Women, defined the group as those born between 1981 and 1996, favour Democrats by an extraordinarily large 47% points. Millennial men also lean Democratic, but the gap is much smaller, only 8% points. Because the Democratic Party has not had huge national triumphs as of late, the obvious inference is that the Republican Party is doing something to turn off those millennial women.

I view the national-level Republican Party, at least in its current incarnation, as putting forward a vision of strong sexual dimorphism. That is, the underlying presumption is that men and women are very different, and there’s a belief that in terms of norms, behaviour and the law, men and women should be very different.

The symbols emanating from the White House reflect this vision. The Trump cabinet and advisory teams have been well-stocked with traditional white men in business suits. There doesn’t appear to have been much deliberate attempt to pursue gender balance. Trump’s manner projects an older American vision of masculinity; he even married a fashion model. His broader patterns of behaviour with women are well-known, and very far away from being gender egalitarian.

This framework also explains why Trump has stuck with his (now slightly eased) transgender ban in the military. It would have been easy enough to let this announced policy slip away into oblivion, given how much else is going on, but the idea of reaffirming traditional male-female gender distinctions, and punishing those who challenge them, has a natural appeal in his worldview.

In short, the Trump administration is projecting a symbolic and rhetorical vision of an earlier America where people fit into traditional gender roles. It is no surprise that millennial women, who have unparalleled opportunities for education and autonomy, are mostly responding negatively. Older white men, of course, are much more likely to be Trump supporters.

In a recent symposium, the Weekly Standard correspondent Christopher Caldwell suggested that “the Democrats have become the party of sexual morality”. That’s insightful, but I don’t think it is quite the right description either. Those on the left are more likely to criticise the sexual behaviour of powerful white men, as seen in the #MeToo movement. But when it comes to moralising about the behaviour of single mothers, or discussing the social costs of the large numbers of births out of wedlock, it is still conservatives who are taking the lead. The debate on abortion plays out a similar logic, where the value of autonomy for women is opposed by an alternative vision of responsible motherhood and the sanctity of the family and the foetus.

The centrality of gender to current American politics surfaces even when the topic is race. A recent study by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R Jones and Sonya R Porter considers the mobility prospects of black Americans, including those from well-off families. The most striking result is that black daughters from well-to-do families do fine, but the sons do not. In other words, our race failings are gender failings too.

Looking at gender also helps explain why at least some aspects of American politics seem to have become more polarised, with no apparent end in sight. Women have a higher level of education and influence than ever before, and that gives them a greater voice in politics. It has also created a backlash among many men. All of a sudden, there is a new clash of visions that had previously been suppressed. You’ll find similar clashes around the world, even in Norway.

One implication is that a lot of recently arrived immigrants may find themselves less opposed to the Republican Party than many Democratic strategists had been expecting. Not all of those individuals will have the gender egalitarian sympathies of the well-educated women who were born and grew up in the US.

So how will this turn out? There is a tendency on the progressive left to think that enlightenment eventually arrives, and that egalitarian visions will outcompete the attempts to ramp up gender dimorphism. I’m not so sure. I’m struck by recent research that in wealthier economies, men and women tend to show greater personality differences, and that women are less likely to pursue STEM degrees. If we wished to give this story a Shakespearean close, it could be said that politics and sex are two topics that usually surprise us.

The killing of two Shiv Sena members- Sanjay Kotkar and Vasant Thube in Ahmednagar on Saturday followed by the arrest of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator, which led to violence at police headquarter, has brought the focus back on how the western Maharashtra town has seen criminalisation of politics over the years.

The distinct factor of the latest violence has been that leaders of political parties accused of Sena members’ killings and subsequent violence are relatives of each other.

Following the violence, police filed two FIRs, one under section 302 (murder) and 120b (criminal conspiracy) for the killing of two Shiv Sena members Sanjay Kotkar and Vasant Thube and second for violence at police superintendent’s office. The Sena members were shot at and also attacked with sharp weapons.

Among 31 booked for the killing of Sena members include NCP MLA Sangram Jagtap, his father and Member of Legislative Council Arun Jagtap, and father-in-law Shivaji Kardile, who is BJP legislator.

In the second FIR, police have booked 51 persons including BJP MLA Kardile, after large mob comprising of NCP workers stormed the office and of the superintendent of police and ransacked it.

Saturday’s killings were the fallout of rivalry emerging out of by-polls necessitated after a Congress corporator was convicted for the murder of a political activist.

Congress member Vishal Kotkar, also an accused in the Sena members’ murder case, won the by-polls after his father and three other family members were convicted for the murder of political opponent Ashok Lande during 2012.

While Kardile’s elder daughter is married to Sangram Jagtap, his second daughter is the wife of Vishal Kotkar’s brother and former mayor Sandip Kotkar.

Considered as the strongman in Ahmednagar politics, Kardile faces 12 different criminal cases, including those of murder and extortion.

Shivaji Shirke, political observer and local journalist for two decades said, “Ahmednagar has seen criminalisation of politics with leaders of every party sharing relationship with members from rival parties. This has made it easier for them to prevent others from entering into politics.”

Commenting on the links of Jagtap, Kardile and Kotkar in the Sena members killings, senior party leader and minister in state cabinet Ramdas Kadam said, “The NCP, Congress and BJP jointly hatched a conspiracy to kill Shiv Sena members.” Kadam also demanded the removal of district police chief saying the senior officials were ‘mute spectators’ when the violence occurred.

Responding to violence, district guardian minister Ram Shinde said, “No one including political leaders will be spared if police find their involvement in the Sena members killings and subsequent violence.”

Geographically one of the largest districts in the state, Ahmednagar with a population of 45 lakh is politically an important district given the cooperative movement taking roots in the district, which has produced leaders such as Balasaheb Vikhe Patil, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Balasaheb Thorat and others."

Updated: Apr 05, 2018 14:01 IST

Nepal’s Prime Minister K P Oli arrives in Delhi on Friday.

As conventional as it may seem – for every new Nepali PM makes his first visit to India – it comes after three years of deep acrimony between India and Oli and about six months of an intense effort by the two to patch up.

The discord

The differences are now well-documented.

India took a strong position on the Nepali constitution, promulgated in September 2015, as it believed it did not address the concerns of the people of the Tarai. Oli being the primary architect of the constitution defended it with all his strength. India backed a blockade by the Madhesis to cripple supplies to Kathmandu to generate pressure. Oli, as PM, used it to stoke ultra- nationalism and shift Nepal’s orientation towards China.

India cobbled together a coalition of the Nepali Congress, Maoists and Madhesi forces to topple Oli.

Oli, backed by China, allied with the Maoists and won elections late last year on a strong ‘nationalist’ plank.

How was it that despite this turbulence, Delhi and Oli arrived at a working relationship?

The rapprochement

A little before the Nepal elections in November-December, a senior Indian political interlocutor visited Kathmandu.

Over an extended meeting, the then leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), K P Oli relayed to him a set of reasons for his unhappiness with India-- the primary ones being how Delhi had sought to undermine his position, tried to stop him from becoming PM in 2015 and toppled his government in 2016, despite the fact that he was ‘India’s closest friend’ in Nepal. The Indian intermediary conveyed to him that India had no intention of doing so, assured him Delhi would stay neutral in the election, and work with him if elected, but in return, Oli must drop the ‘anti India’ positioning.

Oli’s party, in alliance with the Maoists, swept the polls.

There was a view in Delhi that India must do what it could to stop the Oli-Maoist combine from coming to power. But this was quickly overruled. At various levels, Delhi’s engagement with Oli intensified.

The same interlocutor met him in Bangkok and reiterated India would work with his government. On his part, Oli pledged he would stick to tradition and make his first visit to India as a sign of his commitment to close ties between the two countries.

PM Narendra Modi spoke to Oli twice on the phone before he became PM and once after he took office; External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made a visit to Kathmandu before the Oli government took over and, defying protocol, spent most of her time with UML leaders (then still in opposition) and met Nepali Congress leader and PM Sher Bahadur Deuba at the end. Besides, the Indian ambassador to Nepal - senior diplomat Manjeev Puri - has been on a charm offensive to woo Oli.

Oli’s India visit is a culmination of this intensified diplomacy.

The risks

But the rapprochement has happened at a certain cost and carries certain risks. The cautionary note comes from three different schools, in Delhi and Kathmandu.

First, in Kathmandu, leaders of the Nepali Congress feel let down by India. Five NC leaders have visited Delhi in the last three weeks, and have met a range of political leaders and officials with broadly the same message - Oli and Maoists are consolidating; they are taking over state institutions and the democratic space is shrinking. They are of the view that by ‘appeasing’ Oli and almost ‘bending over backwards’, India is enabling Oli to become stronger at the cost of its older friends. If this continues, at least two of the four NC leaders have warned, they too would be forced to take an ‘ultra nationalist’ position-- since criticising India helps domestically and has no cost externally. Delhi can be taken for granted as Oli has shown, one NC leader commented, with a tinge of bitterness.

Indian interlocutors have told the NC that it is overreacting; they fared poorly in elections because of poor leadership, poor governance and factionalism and should get their house in order first; that India has no choice but to work with the elected government in Kathmandu and that the NC would remain a cherished friend.

Second, those who have sounded an alarm bell are senior Madhesis political figures, but more vocally, the civil society. They believe that Delhi’s entire rapprochement with Oli has come at the cost of Madhesi rights. India has dropped the agenda of a constitutional amendment to address issues of federal re-demarcation, which was at the heart of a prolonged India backed agitation in 2015-16 . While Tarai parties have done well in elections and formed the government in the Madhes province of eastern Nepali plains, community leaders and opinion makers have a strong sense of resentment at what they see as Delhi’s betrayal.

India’s response to them is on these lines - we are with you; there is no way we can drop the agenda of Madhesi people; your divisions have harmed the cause; work together. But a key Indian minister is understood to have told Madhesi leaders that the political context did not allow India to raise their issues and it had to protect its interests at the moment.

The third cautionary note comes from within the government of India itself and the strategic community here. A section of India’s intelligentsia, officials who have served in Nepal, and retired diplomats believe that in what is coming across as a rather desperate quest to show that its ties with Kathmandu are fine, and avoid ‘bad headlines’, Delhi may be hurting its long term interests.

They believe while engaging with Oli is a necessity, India is underestimating the inherent dangers. They argue China has brought Oli and Maoists together; Oli’s primary loyalty will be to the ‘north’; India should not get misled by optics; Oli will sooner or later cross the strategic ‘redlines’; it is important that India has alternatives at that point; the current approach will leave Oli so strong that it will be difficult to dislodge him; Delhi must continue to engage with Maoist leader Prachanda and seek to wean him away from Oli to break their alliance; it must also work to strengthen the NC and Madhesis and create a coalition which can take on the UML eventually; India is currently appearing weak and Nepali political actors will not take Indian power and messages seriously.

The dominant school of thought -- which is backed by the EAM, key political interlocutors, and bureaucrats at the external affairs ministry -- however does not buy this ‘alarmist’ version. They believe that India has to respect the democratic mandate of the Nepali people, or else it would end up further alienating popular opinion; that Oli must be given a chance and it is important to wait and watch how Oli engages with both India and China; that if he wants to indeed develop Nepal and leave a legacy, he cannot antagonise India; and that India does not have much of a choice either - Prachanda is unreliable, the NC is weak, and Madhesi parties are geographically limited to eight districts and backing them publicly invites the wrath of Kathmandu’s political elites and pushes it towards China further.

It is against this backdrop - of deep discord, rapprochement, and internal arguments with friends back in Kathmandu and within the system in Delhi - that the Government of India is laying out red carpet for K P Oli. The visit represents a dramatic tale of fluidity of politics and diplomacy."

Updated: Apr 04, 2018 18:15 IST

The United States has once again tightened the noose around the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), one of the most potent anti-India forces that operates from Pakistani soil, by designating the Milli Muslim League (MML) and Tehreek-e-Azadi-e-Kashmir (TAJK) as fronts for the terror group. Both MML and TAJK are political forces created by LeT founder Hafiz Saeed, the former with an eye on contesting Pakistan’s upcoming general election.

While announcing the designations, an American official said the US was targeting MML and its leaders because they were complicit in LeT’s efforts to “undermine Pakistan’s political process”. In other words, the US was doing what rightly should have been done by Pakistan’s government and political leadership, had they really been intent on insulating the political arena from the venom of extremism and terrorism.

The US move against LeT is also proof that the world community hasn’t bought into Pakistan’s half-hearted efforts earlier this year to crack down on the Jamaat-ud-Dawah and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, two more fronts of LeT, to counter an effort to put the country on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF’s) watch list. Pakistan is now set to enter the FATF’s grey list and the US designations reflect that a close watch is being kept by the world community on Pakistan’s efforts to counter terrorism and terror financing.

To be fair, Pakistan’s election commission had refused to register MML as a political party, but the judiciary, which for some reason has always been seen as soft on Saeed and his myriad groups, has, through a recent order, kept the door open on the group’s registration. Clearly, Saeed formed MML as part of the grand army-backed plan to mainstream and legitimise terror groups under the fig leaf of allowing them to form political entities that can contest elections. Retired and serving Pakistani military officials have spoken about this project, which apparently was opposed by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Most of the jihadis chosen for this project are focused on Kashmir.

Pakistan has maintained a studied silence on the designation of MML, but it will be difficult for the government to allow, in any way, the registration of Saeed’s henchmen as a political party at a time when terrorism, or Islamabad’s failure to comprehensively crack down on the menace, is a key source of the tensions with the US. As Pakistan prepares for what will be only its second peaceful transfer of power, its political leadership will do well to keep Saeed and his ilk out of the body politic."

On March 26, when thousands of Dalits gathered at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan to demand the arrest of Sambhaji Bhide, the right-wing Hindutva leader accused of instigating violence in the aftermath of the Dalit event at Bhima Koregaon, a youngster’s presence at the public rally evoked curious reactions.

Twenty-three-year-old Sujat Ambedkar, great grandson of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, was the cynosure of all eyes. “The response to his speech was huge for two reasons,” said Siddharth Gaikwad, one of the attendees, adding that besides the speech, his long curly hair evoked as much reaction from the crowd.

For Sujat, that response has made him explore the option of dedicating himself wholly to politics, and to work with his father Prakash Ambedkar, president, Bharipa Bahujan Maha Sangh. “I would definitely want to work with the party my father is heading,” said Sujat, who is a political science graduate from Fergusson college and also has a degree from the Asian College of Journalism.

Sujat played in a rock band in college and the Dalit cause may well hope that the prevailing riff from this Ambedkar’s rock days is ‘progressive’ and not ‘alternate’.

Take his view on reservations, for example. “I don’t think there is a need for political reservation. In jobs and education, reservation should be continued although people who have achieved a certain economic condition should voluntarily give a chance to those in the community, who are still at the bottom of the pyramid,” says Sujat.

Sujat’s views are similar to his father’s. In an interview in 2013, Prakash Ambedkar had said that the time has come for scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) to get rid of reservation in electoral politics.

Sujat, for the record, has never availed of any reservation and always studied through the open category. “I consider myself most privileged since I got everything from the beginning,” he says, wanting to go beyond reservations and atrocities against Dalits to highlight day-to-day issues being faced by the marginalised through the website he is planning to launch.

The fourth generation Ambedkar scion is currently serving his notice-period at a city-based tabloid he joined some four months ago. “I have resigned from the paper because I want to start a news portal that will raise issues of the marginalised class,” says Sujat.

While it was his first public appearance at the Azad Maidan rally, he had already hit the headlines two years ago.

In March 2016, Sujat and members of a leftist union clashed with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), when the latter tried to organise a function on the Fergusson college campus.

Sujat and other students, calling themselves as ‘Ambedkarites’, opposed the function, which forced college authorities to call for police intervention. The whole issue later snowballed into a major political row.

Student politics triggered by the Fergusson incident is now resonating at various levels in the state, what, with the caste cauldron churning after Marathas came out on to the streets in large numbers following the Dalit assertion, post the Bhima-Koregaon violence.

The controversy offered Sujat, born in the city and a student of an English medium school, the first few lessons in politics, one of these being to be politically correct. Sujat also spoke about the Prevention of Atrocities Act, because of which various states in north India witnessed violence on Monday, killing nine people.

“Atrocity Act is the only safeguard Dalits in India have. We should not dilute it,” said Sujat, while reacting to recent Supreme Court ruling.

Reservation-less future?

Sujat’s take on reservation may not find immediate resonance among Dalits, but it has takers among a small group of SCs and STs who have climbed the social pyramid and want to allow others from the community to now avail the benefits.

“Dalits should defeat caste with capital and become job providers,” says Milind Kamble, chairman of the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The issue of reservation has been at the centre stage of political debate in Maharashtra with Marathas and other castes demanding quotas for the community. In his recent interview, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the time has come to give reservation on the basis of economic criterion rather than caste. Reactions to Pawar’s remarks were mixed.

“For me, this is not the time to give reservations in jobs and education on economic criterion,” said Sujat, reacting to Pawar’s remarks."

Updated: Mar 18, 2018 15:16 IST

In September 2010, the vice-chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), then known as the University of Pune, appointed a professor from the Marathi department to head the department of English. I was a full professor by then, and the headship of the English department should have been offered to me, since it was my turn to be the head, after other professors had been appointed to the post and had completed their tenure.

Yet, for reasons best known to itself, the university invited a professor from the Marathi department to head the English department.

When some newspapers confronted the university administration and asked if I was denied the headship because I was openly queer, the university denied the charge. My being queer was my “personal affair” they claimed. Yet it was obvious that it was my sexuality that bothered them.

It will be recalled that it was in that very year (2010) that Shreenivas Ramchandra Siras, a Marathi professor, was suspended by the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) administration for being gay. This was the result of a “sting operation” that they conducted that showed him having sex with a “lowly” rickshaw-puller in his campus apartment. Professor Siras was unceremoniously thrown out of his campus flat and was later found dead in a flat that he was forced to rent. The film Aligarh, released in 2016, is a biopic on the professor’s life.

It must be reiterated that 2010, the year when both the above events took place, was a year when the Delhi High Court ruling of July 2009, which read down Section 377 (a law that criminalises sexual activities “against the law of nature”) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to exclude consenting adult homosexuals from its purview, was still in force.

In my case, it was only after the then dean of the Arts faculty intervened and put in a word in my favour, that the university finally appointed me as head of the English department ten months later, in July 2011.

Cut to April 2017 when I retired from the SPPU. With my retirement, six of the eight sanctioned posts in the English department got vacant. These were all senior posts, two of them being professor and four associate professor posts. Yet, when the circumstances actually demanded that a professor from another department be invited to head the department of English, the university did not do so. Instead, it flouted all norms by appointing an assistant professor of the English department as the head.

Before retiring, I met the then vice-chancellor of SPPU twice with a request that the interviews be conducted, and at least some of the six vacant posts in the department be filled. Earlier, I and another senior professor of the department who retired a few months before me had scrutinised applications and found at least half a dozen candidates to be qualified for the posts. But the university turned a blind eye to my request. The department of English remained one of the only departments in which the posts were not filled, while they were duly filled in most other departments.

For technical reasons, the assistant professor who was made the head of the department was found to be unqualified for the post of associate professor for which she had applied, although she had a reasonably good academic record. Her lack of experience was reflected in the clumsy way in which she managed the day-to-day teaching and research programmes of the department.

Instead of inviting experienced faculty from colleges affiliated to SPPU, such as Fergusson college, Symbiosis and Garware college, to supplement the teaching done by her and the only other assistant professor in the department, which has always been the practice followed, she appointed teaching associates who were mere MA (Master of Arts) and MPhil (Master of Philosophy) students of previous years, with virtually no teaching experience, to handle the bulk of the department’s workload. I believe she had a vested interest in doing so—the faculty at the affiliated colleges were all of associate professor rank, while the lady herself was an assistant professor. So it was hierarchical considerations, rather than the interest of students that governed her decisions.

Incidentally, the rules permit teaching associates to be appointed to supplement the work of the tenured faculty. It is ridiculous to let teaching associates handle the bulk of the workload of a department. But that is unfortunately how it is in SPPU’s English department today.

The same hierarchical considerations surfaced when the head appointed a committee of unqualified persons to conduct the MPhil and PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) interviews recently. One committee member did not possess a PhD, while another had a PhD but wasn’t a research supervisor.

I joined SPPU’s English department in 1988 and retired in 2017, nearly thirty years later. Before me, doyens of English studies, such as professor S Nagarajan who started the department in the 1960s, and professor Meenakshi Mukherjee, the distinguished critic, had taught in the department. During my time, I have seen other luminaries such as Gauri Deshpande (daughter of Iravati Karve), Rajeev Patke, a Rhodes scholar, Udaya Kumar and Freya Taraporewala Barua, both Oxonians, among others, teach in the department.

It is truly a pity that the present university administration is blissfully unaware of the department’s glorious legacy, and has allowed it to go to seed. The sufferers’ undoubtedly are the students who come to study at the department from far off places because of its legacy. A seminar here, a film screening there, isn’t enough to atone for the department’s lapses.

A year has gone by. Will the honourable vice-chancellor kindly sit up and take notice?

Amruta Fadnavis, let’s sing a song to save Pune’s rivers

Dear Amruta Fadnavis,

As persons who have resided in Maharashtra most of our life, we can say with all certainty that all of Maharashtra is proud to have you as her First Lady. You have blazed new trails, be it for political events or for charity. You are a woman of conviction and a trailblazer setting new benchmarks and changing perceptions in the role of First Lady.

The song you sang for the video Mumbai River Anthem has already crossed 2.3 million views in the first week of release and just proves your thumping popularity, while driving home the fact that you care for Mumbai’s natural beauty and her water bodies.

Pune is no strange place to you, as you have been a student here doing your MBA course. You’ll agree that the basis of the natural beauty of Pune has been its clean rivers. However, over the past few years, they have been in a state of dire neglect and have been badly treated. For Punekars, it is heartbreaking to see her natural resources like water bodies go through such merciless abuse. It is time we revived Pune’s rivers, and we need your help in saving them.

The newspapers inform us that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is about to release 976 hectares (2,411 acres) of land along our river banks to builders. What small semblance of green zone we have is slated to disappear. This will be very much detrimental to our future and a curse on future generations (our children and grandchildren) who will live here.

How do you like the idea of singing a song for Pune’s rivers and performing it over a much publicised event on one of Pune’s iconic bridges, such as, the Lakdi Pul? A poem has been written by the well-known poet Shrirang Godbole who has also set the tune for it.

The event is being envisioned to be organised and advertised in a way that citizens of all age groups gather on each bridge in Pune and sing the same song as a precursor to the main event where you will sing.

No event of this magnitude can be complete without the active participation of political stalwarts like MPs, MLAs, the mayor of Pune, as well as the principal secretary (housing and urban development), municipal commissioner and other senior government officers. The idea is to have a chief singer on each bridge ably supported by senior MPs and MLAs. It will be for the first time that Pune would brace herself for an event of such high significance and magnitude to save her rivers.

May we also request that you put in a good word to your husband, the chief minister, to grace the occasion and lend his good offices to the event in Pune?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his nonagenarian mother for politics by letting her stand in queue to exchange old currency, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday.

In a tweet, Kejriwal said Modi didn’t do the right thing by letting his 97-year-old mother Hiraben Modi stand in queue at a local bank in Gandhinagar – images of which were beamed live on national television.

“If there was a need to stand in line, I would stand myself, not my mother.”

Kejriwal and Modi have a bitter history of confrontation and the Delhi CM has often blamed the prime minister for not letting the city government work. He has also called Modi a coward in the past.

Earlier in the day, Hiraben – lives with Modi’s younger brother Pankaj -- came to a branch of Oriental Bank of Commerce at Raisan village to get banknotes worth Rs 4,500 exchanged.

She was one of millions of similar consumers who lined up outside banks and ATMs to get cash following a surprise recall of high-value currency by Modi last Tuesday.

Agencies reported that Hiraben came to the bank with Rs 500 notes, got the mandatory form filled, put her thumb impression on the form and exchanged her money.

After receiving a new note of Rs 2,000, she also displayed it in front of the mediapersons.

Hitting out at Modi, Kejriwal accused that the Prime Minister’s rich friends were not facing problems in exchanging notes. “PM is not acting against people named in Panama List as many are his friends,” Kejriwal said during the Delhi assembly.

“PM’s war is against the country’s poor and not against black money. The Centre waived Rs 1.14 lakh crore loan of industrialists, but are threatening people if they deposit more than 2.5 lakh in account,” the Delhi chief minister further raged.

There was some commotion during the proceedings as leader of opposition, Vijender Gupta, objected to Kejriwal raising Modi’s name. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel ordered marshals to escort Gupta out of the assembly.

Success has many fathers, failure is an orphan. No one knows this better than Indian sportsmen, who, as one columnist aptly put, should get Olympic medals for just putting up with the country’s incapable and overbearing sports officials. The politicians are no better. Soon after badminton champion PV Sindhu won a silver medal in the Rio Olympics, a tussle erupted between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over which state she belongs to. Many people and politicians in Telangana claimed Sindhu is their pride because she was born and brought up in Hyderabad and her father is from Telangana. Those from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh - which shares Hyderabad as capital till 2024 - countered that claim, saying that her mother is from Vijayawada. Then there were those who seemed to know the family’s history of relocations: They said her parents migrated to Hyderabad even before she was born and that she is a “typical” Hyderabadi. Other reports suggested that a large number of people were googling her caste when she was playing the finals.

This tendency of putting some kind of a tag on winners is wrong. Soon after Sakshi Malik won bronze in wrestling, people including senior political leaders started calling her “India’s daughter” and we were even reminded helpfully that victory came on the auspicious day of raksha bandhan. Some saluted the “woman, the athlete and the Indian” in her when all we should have been celebrating her success as an Indian champ. Even in her moment of glory, we selfishly did not forget to appropriate her success by force-pasting some ludicrous patriarchal label on her forehead.

Coming back to PV Sindhu, it is also sad to see that when it came to giving her cash prizes for her stupendous achievement, the two states tried to outdo each other just to prove her state lineage, as if she will opt for the state which gives her more money. The announcement of cash bonuses for both PV Sindhu and coach P Gopichand should have be made in a civil and sophisticated manner befitting a champion who deserves every bit of it. Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should stop playing such petty regional games over the badminton star and accept that she does not belong to any state/region/caste/linguistic group. PV Sindhu, Dipa Karmakar and Sakshi Malik don’t belong to any one particular state anymore; they are jewels in India’s crown.

India vs South Africa 1st ODI: Heavy rains washed out IND vs SA first ODI at the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday. It looked well and good even half an hour before toss but once it started raining, it never really allowed the groundsmen to return and do the damage-control. This is now the second match in a row which has been washed out in Dharamsala without a ball being bowled. The last match was also an India-South Africa affair last year in September. The three-match series now effectively becomes a two-match affair. The next two ODIs are slated to be played in Lucknow on Mar 15 and in Kolkata on Mar 18 and as per the Indian Govt’s advisory, they are likely to be played within closed doors.

India vs South Africa 1st ODI at Dharamsala

17:22 hrs: THE MATCH HAS BEEN CALLED OFF due to rains in Dharamsala.

The 1st ODI between India and South Africa has been abandoned due to rains.#INDvSA pic.twitter.com/Oc5iO6q9dj — BCCI (@BCCI) March 12, 2020

17:10 hrs: The covers are still on, the announcement is just minutes away.

17:02 hrs: Remaining two matches of India-South Africa ODI series likely to be played in empty stadiums due to COVID-19 threat: BCCI source told PTI.

16:54 hrs: It has started to drizzle again.

16:41 hrs: The rain has stopped and two Super Soppers out there but it has turned dark again at Dharamsala. It will need an herculean task to get a game from this situation.

16:30 hrs: Still drizzling! The ground has been completely covered for the past couple of hours or so and the light drizzle has ensured it stays that way.

16:12 hrs: It has almost stopped raining in Dharamsala, ALMOST! But is it too late? And we can’t even guarantee that it won’t comeback to dash our hopes. If it stays like this then we might just be able to sneak in a game. Remember the cut-off time is 6:30 for a 20-over game.

16:02 hrs: Live visuals are not at all promising from Dharamsala. The entire ground is under wraps and it is still raining, not as heavy as it was a few minutes ago but enough to keep everyone including the groundsmen away from the field.

15:51: Our correspondent Khurram Habib says, it is unlikely that we’re going to have a game today. It is pelting down at Dharamsala right now.

Rain has returned for the umpteenth time in Dharamsala. Umbrellas out now. Unlikely there'll be a game. pic.twitter.com/DCVePUOWwo — Khurram Habib (@khurramhabib) March 12, 2020

15:45 hrs: The rain had just stopped for a brief period but even before we could finish the update, it returned again.The crowds have slowly started to made their way out. They know it is now very difficult to get a game.

15:28 hrs: There is still nothing to update as rain is still coming down hard at the venue. Covers are still on and gloomy faces in the stands still there.

15:20 hrs: Just to remind you, the cut off time for a 20 over match is 6:30 PM. If by then rain doesn’t relent then the match will be called off.

The cut-off time for a 20-over match is 6:30pm IST#INDvSA pic.twitter.com/4pPKJsmRBW — BCCI (@BCCI) March 12, 2020

15:11 hrs: The latest update from our correspondent Khurram Habib from Dharamsala.

Crowd not staying back as these are open stands in Dharamsala pic.twitter.com/idXNoCALu5 — Khurram Habib (@khurramhabib) March 12, 2020

15:05 hrs: We have officially started to lose overs now. We will lose an over for every four minutes of no play from now on.

15:00 hrs: Cut-off time - Chances of getting a full 50-over game is pretty much out of the equation now. Meanwhile the cut-off for a 20-over game is 6:30 pm. So we still have a good 3 and a half hours to go for that.

14:55 hrs: Rain returns! Just when it was looking all okay, the covers were being removed and we were hoping for an official update about the toss, dark clouds have returned and it has started to rain again. This doesn’t look good at all.

14:25 hrs: Rain has stopped for now, we are waiting for the groundstaff to remove the covers. Things have just started to clear up in Dharamsala. But we will have to wait for the official inspection.

14:05 hrs: Our correspondent Khurram Habib brings the live pictures from Dharamsala.

13:49 hrs: Dharamsala weather update - The rain seems to have relented for now but the dark clouds are still hovering over the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala. The groundsmen haven’t removed the covers yet, looks like they are suspecting more rain soon.

13:40 hrs: Meanwhile, the IPL governing council is slated meet on March 14 to decide the fate of IPL 2020 due the outbreak of coronavirus. Due to the Indian government’s decision of not granting visas till April 15 (barring certain diplomatic exceptions), the foreign players participation have been in jeopardy.

13:33 hrs: Rain gets heavier! This is not good news at all. It is pouring down now at Dharamsala and the groundstaff are running here and there to bring in more covers. The floodlights have switched on.

13:30 hrs: The last encounter! We might be hated for this piece of information but the last match in Dharamsala was a washout and any guesses who were the two teams? It was India and South Africa, the only difference that time was that it was a T20I. Well, we really hope history doesn’t repeat itself this time around.

13:26 hrs: Hardik Pandya is set to make a comeback for India, that is if the rain allows play in the first ODI. The all-rounder has been away from international cricket for close to six months. But he is up and running now. He was seen going about his business even an hour earlier.

13:21 hrs: The umbrellas are out! Even as we spoke about the stands being empty, about a few hundred have trickled in and they are making a lot of noise, more in anticipation than in anything else. Meanwhile, more covers are being brought in, not a good news.

13:12 hrs: Rain returns! Just minutes before the inspection, the rain has returned in Dharamsala and it has turned very dark. More covers have been brought in. Doesn’t look like we’re gonna have the inspection any time soon.

13:08 hrs: Empty stands! The fear has just into a reality. There were reports of more than 40% tickets going unsold and so far that has turned out to be true and in fact, the majority of the 60% too seems to have decided to give the first India vs South Africa ODI at Dharamsala a miss. The stands are largely even as we near scheduled start of play.

13:04 hrs: Dharamsala weather report - There are chances of rain around 2 pm and again in the evening between 4 and 5 pm. So we can expect a stop and start game between India and South Africa today.

12:58 hrs: Pitch report! ‘This is a typical Indian pitch, the batsmen will enjoy themselves. Nothing much in it for the new-ball bowlers, the finger spinners will not enjoy this surface as much as the wrist spinners, it looks very dry and it’s a bat-first pitch,’ reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Murali Kartik, in their pitch report.

12:52 hrs: Shouldn’t be a long delay! There was rain on Wednesday evening and night, which has made it difficult for the groundstaff to make the outfield ready on time but thankfully there has been no rain this morning. The players are out there and so are the umpires. We shouldn’t be away from live action for long.

12:48 hrs: Toss delayed due to wet outfield! Inspection to take place at 1:15 pm.

Update - Toss has been delayed in Dharamsala. Next inspection at 1.15 PM IST.

No foreign player will be available for this year’s IPL till April 15 due to visa restrictions imposed by the government to contain the novel coronavirus threat, a top BCCI source told PTI on Thursday, casting fresh doubts on the fate of the event.

“The foreign players who play in the IPL come under the Business Visa category. As per the government’s directive, they can’t come till April 15,” a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

The government issued fresh advisory with a ban on all existing foreign visas, except a few categories like diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in the wake of new positive cases of novel coronavirus in the country.

A spectator who attended the India vs Australia Women’s T20 World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia on May 8 has been diagnosed with novel coronavirus (COVID-19), confirmed the Melbourne Cricket Ground management.

“The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has advised of the patron’s diagnosis and has classified it as a low-risk of spreading COVID-19 to surrounding members of the public and staff. The patron sat on Level 2 of the Northern Stand at the MCG in section N42,” said The Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), as ground managers of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in a statement.

The MCC, as ground managers of the MCG, is aware that a person who attended the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Final at the MCG on Sunday March 8 has now been diagnosed with COVID-19.

A record number of people attended the India vs Australia women’s T20 World Cup Final on Sunday. ICC announced that 86,174 people attended the India vs Australia final at the MCG. This is a record for a women’s sporting event in Australia while also becoming the most attended women’s cricket match in the history of the sport.

A lot was expected from the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side but as fate would have it, the India women’s cricket team perhaps reserved their worst performance of the Women’s T20 World Cup for the final. They were outplayed in all three departments, to say the least as hosts Australia won their fifth T20 World Cup title after beating India by a whopping 85 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

The gap between the two sides was so big that the win predictor never climbed up to more than 20% in India’s favour in the entire duration of the final.

Batting first, Australia posted 184 for 4 – their highest score of the World Cup as the Indian bowlers had no answers to the assault of Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney. And even when they did, the fielders let them down. Both Healy and Mooney were dropped inside the powerplay. Healy, who was on 9 when she was dropped by Shafali Verma, went on to score 75 off just 39 balls while Mooney, dropped on 8, batted through the innings with an unbeaten 78.

In reply, the Indian batters were no good. Megan Schutt and Jess Jonassen ran through the visitors’ batting line-up to bowl them out for 99."

Brijesh Patel, chairman of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Governing Council, said on Wednesday that they will be discuss the coronavirus threat in the IPL GC meeting on March 14 and reiterated that the tournament will not be affected by the pandemic. There have been a lot of reports going on about the shadow cast by the virus on the future of the tournament but Patel said that necessary precautions will be taken during the tournament.

“Why will COVID-19 attack only IPL? We are monitoring the situation. All cricket matches, be it Ranji Trophy final, or series between Afghanistan and Ireland, England and Sri Lanka and Australia-New Zealand are currently going ahead as per schedule. The Road Safety World Series is on. These matches have seen full houses at the stadium in Mumbai. Local trains are running, schools and colleges are not totally shut,” Patel told The Week.

“We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis. We will take all necessary precautions as prescribed by WHO and Ministry of Health. The IPL Governing Council is meeting on 14th March to take stock of the situation.”

The Maharashtra government, which discussed outbreak, asked on Wednesday if IPL matches can be postponed, cancelled or even held in empty stadiums.

“BCCI is ready to hold the IPL tournament without audience. It means there will be no sale of tickets. However, we are yet to receive any official request. We will consider it after receiving. If necessary, the IPL matches can be postponed,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said.

The participation of foreign players at this year’s IPL came under severe doubt after the government ordered fresh visa restrictions to contain the spread of novel coronavirus even as the BCCI decided to adopt a wait and watch policy for now.

The pressure has increased manifold after the Legends T20 meet games in Pune, featuring the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara were cancelled.

The fate of the PIL is set to be heard in Madras High Court on Thursday.

And amid a possibility that the Maharashtra government might bar IPL games in the state, the only feasible solution is having matches inside empty stadiums. This will save the broadcasters from losing advertisement money as matches are insured which means both the BCCI and franchisees will recover bulk of their investment."

The remaining matches of the Road Safety World Series will be played behind closed doors at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai starting March 13 when South Africa Legends take on Sri Lanka Legends in a revised schedule due to the rising concerns over coronavirus in the country.

The decision has been taken as the most responsible course of action, to protect the health and safety of the players, staff and spectators.

The numbers of cases in Maharashtra are escalating and as a result, the organising committee unanimously agreed that the third leg of the series, which was scheduled to be held in Pune from March 14 to 20, be relocated to DY Patil Stadium and played behind closed doors along with the remaining games at the same venue and the final.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 19:20 IST

Saurashtra vs Bengal: Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi’s strong partnership has brought Bengal right back in the game. Anustup who remained unbeaten on 58 led the way for Bengal in the final session along Arnab Nadi (28*) as the visitors ended Day 4 at 354 for 6, trailing Saurashtra by 71 runs Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra in Rajkot. Earlier, Saha rode his luck to reach his fifty at the stroke of lunch while Chatterjee reached his fifty off 154 balls on early in the morning session. Overnight batsmen Chatterjee and Saha have done a good job after resuming the day at 134/3. They will have to continue the good work in order to get past Saurashtra’s first innings total of 425.

17:00 hrs: STUMPS AT DAY 4! Bengal have reached 354 for 6, trail Saurashtra by 71 runs. Anustup Majumdar (58*) and Arnab Nandi (28*) will resume their quest of taking the lead and dare we say, even the Ranji Trophy title tomorrow at Rajkot.

16:52 hrs: FOUR! Brilliant cover drive from Anustup Majumdar. This man can do no wrong now. A full and wide delivery from Unadkat, Manjumdar gets a good stride in and just strokes it throught the gap. The partnership is now 90 between Anustup and Nandi.

16:49 hrs: Now Arnab Nandi is down! He has been hit on the hands by an Unadkat delivery that bounced awkwardly. We have another stoppage in play.

16:44 hrs: Anustup has hurt himself! The physios are out there to attend him. Doesn’t look like a serious injury. he was hit on the hands.

16:35 hrs: FOUR! Brilliant use of the feet by Anustup Majumdar and he strokes it through the mid-wicket region for a boundary that brings up his fifty, what an innings it has been, the crisis man for Bengal is standing up again.

16:27 hrs: Back-to-back boundaries! The first one from Anustup Majumdar’s bat, the next was byes but Bengal will take both of them gleefully. The deficit is under 100 now, this has turned out to be a brilliant partnership for Bengal. The Saurashtra bowlers now feeling the heat.

16:24 hrs: Maiden from Prerak! A much needed one from Saurashtra’s point of view. Bengal had got far too many free boundaries in the last 5 overs.

16:15 hrs: FOUR! Pitched up from Prerak, Nandi clears his front leg and whips it for a boundary. That brings up the fifty-run partnership between Nandi and Anustup.

16:01 hrs: 2 boundaries but nothing from the bat. 4 byes, not once but two times in the same over from Jaydev Unadkat. Nothing much the keeper could have done to stop those. Some free runs for Bengal.

15:23 hrs: Partnership building. Nandi and Majumdar are building a partnership after Tea. This is the last recognised batting pair and they need to stick it out in the middle all the time.

15:00 hrs: Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi resume innings after Tea. Bengal will hope to get closer to the opponent’s first innings score.

14:45 hrs: Tea! At the end of second session, Bengal have posted 264/6. They are still 161 runs behind Saurashtra’s first innings total. Anustup Majumdar and Arnab Nandi are at the crease.

14:30 hrs: OUT! Chetan Sakariya picks his first wicket of the day as he gets rid of Shahbaz Ahmed for 16. The ball straightened up a bit and the angle of the batsman failed to read the angle of the delivery. Bengal are six down now.

14:12 hrs: Shahbaz Ahmed and Anustup Majumdar hit one boundary each off Chetan Sakariya in one over. Benga need these two to build a partnership to bail them out of trouble.

13:59 hrs: OUT! Prerak Mankad strikes for Saurashtra and Wriddhiman Saha is castled! This is a huge wicket for them as Saha was looking dangerous and this can be the beginning of the end for Bengal.

13:43 hrs: 64 off 180 balls - This has been a resilient knock from Wriddhiman Saha. He has given some chances to Saurashtra but this innings can turn the game in his team’s favour.

13:28 hrs: Anustup Majumdar has started his innings quite tentatively but the boundary will do him a world of good and with Wriddhiman Saha holding fort on one end, Bengal fans will still be dreaming.

13:15 hrs: Finally a breakthrough for Saurashtra! Sudip Chatterjee edged the ball onto his pads and it was an easy catch for the fielder. An important wicket for Dharmendrasinh Jadeja.

13:07 hrs: The 100 run partnership comes up for Sudip Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha with Bengal making a match out of it. When they lost two wickets quickly, a lot of people were inclined to write them off but a good show from Manoj Tiwary and this duo has brought them back into the encounter.

12:51 hrs: Bengal and Saurashtra are out for the second session and this can be a make or break period for them. Sudip Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha have steadied the innings somewhat and a gritty show from them at this point will boost their cause a lot.

12:03 hrs: Lunch Day 4! Bengal 218/3, trail Saurashtra by 207 runs.

11:53 hrs: Saurashtra have wasted three reviews on Wriddhiman Saha! The first two were very close LBW shouts which perhaps would have gone there way had their been ball-tracking but this time their appeal was for an outside edge and the third umpire did not find any conclusive evidence to overturn the on-field call of not out.

11:45 hrs: FOUR! Fifty for Wriddhiman Saha. Not the way he would have liked to but he will have no complains. Once again he wasn’t in control. The ball bounced from good length, took the outside edge of his bat and went through the hands of the fourth slip fielder. He went to his right when the ball was on his left.

11:30 hrs: FOUR! 200 up for Bengal! Wriddhman Saha continues to live dangerously. This time he just skips down and flicks it uppishly, the short-leg which is slightly deeper than usual flings his left hand but doesn’t get the catch.

11:18 hrs: OUT? NOT OUT? DRAMA and what not. Jaydev Unadkat was convinced he had Wriddhiman Saha plumb in front, so much so that he did not even feel the need to look back at the umpire while appealing. But umpire Padmanabhan was unmoved. A stunned Unadkat immediately asked for the review and surprise surprise, what was looking like absolute dead with the naked eye was actually slightly outside the line on impact. The third umpire says, half of the ball is missing, so stay with your on-field decision of not out’ and Saha survives.

11:10 hrs: FOUR! A bit uppish but in the gap. Wriddhiman Saha won’t be too happy with that shot. He played away from the body and had no intentions of keeping it down. Fortunately the ball went through the vacant gully area for a boundary.

10:52 hrs: Chance! Almost a wicket for Saurashtra but it was a difficult one. Saha flicked it with power, the forward short leg did well to get his body on the line, the ball lobbed up in the air after hitting his pads but landed safely, thankfully for Saha.

10:25 hrs: SIX! Wriddhiman Saha shows his class. A flighted delivery from Jadeja, Wriddhiman dances down the track and lofts it straight over the back of the bowler’s head. It comfortably clears the ropes. Some much needed intent from the Bengal wicket-keeper.

09:54 hrs: Fifty for Sudip Chatterjee and he reached the milestone in 154 balls. It looks like the Bengal batsman has taken a leaf out of Cheteshwar Pujara’s book and this has been one gritty knock!

The first ODI encounter between India and South Africa in Dharamsala on Thursday holds extra significance for all-rounder Hardik Pandya as it can be his first international match since September 2019. Pandya was expected to return in the series against New Zealand but was pulled out as his recovery was not complete. However, he proved his mettle in the DY Patil Cup where he slammed an unbeaten 55-ball-158 in which he smashed 20 sixes. Pandya is also on the verge of claiming a major milestone in ODI cricket as the talented all-rounder is just 43 runs shy of becoming the 13th India cricketer ever to achieve the double of 1000 runs and 50 wickets in this format.

Pandya last played an ODI against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final in Manchester and his last international game was a T20 against the Proteas in Bengaluru in September last year.

In an interview with team mate Yuzvendra Chahal which the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) aired on its website, Pandya spoke about the mental struggle of being on the sidelines.

“I missed this atmosphere the most in these last six months, playing for the country and the feeling you get wearing the team’s colours,” he said. “That had become a mental challenge and there were a lot of setbacks. I was trying to get back to full fitness quickly but that did not work out and a lot of mental pressure came at the time. But touchwood, everything went fine, the rehabilitation went well and a lot of people helped me.”

“It was important,” said Pandya when asked about his run of form and his knocks in the DY Patil Cup. “I had not played anything for six and a half months. I wanted to make an international comeback so it was very important for my confidence. No matter how much you practice, the match situation is always different.

“So I just kept on playing, my confidence kept improving and the sixes were coming off well. I thought if they are coming off well, why should I stop and I kept going. But I never thought that I want to hit 20 sixes in an innings,” he added.

Unlike the opening one-day between India and South Africa on Thursday at Dharamshala where less turnout of fans is expected due to coronavirus scare, organisers in Lucknow are sure of a houseful in the second one day international at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium on Sunday.

Around 60 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported so far in the country but the UP Cricket Association and the Ekana Sportz City are claiming to have taken all possible measures to let the fans come to the stadium and enjoy the game.

“So far all is well here as we have been taking all possible measures to avoid the coronavirus scare. Not only virus detectors, but also sanitisers in pouches will be made available to 50,000-odd fans to avoid the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19),” UPCA’s secretary Yudhveer Singh said on Wednesday.

“There is no threat of coronavirus to the match. We have been following all instructions issued by the health organisations, including government agencies. Virus detectors are being installed at all important entries, including those meant for players and officials,” he added. “We will also provide sanitisers to all fans at the entry gates.”

On the issue of slow ticket sale for the first-ever ODI in the state capital, Udai Sinha, managing director of the Ekana Sportz City, said that by Tuesday evening, around 40-45 percent tickets were sold out.

“Certainly, there are apprehensions among fans about the coronavirus, but I am very much sure of getting a good crowd at the match as there are still four days to go in the match. Most of the tickets are being sold online.”

He, however, accepted that low turnout of fans would hamper the game financially. “There are many stakeholders in the match, and the low turnout of fans would affect them financially too,” he said.

The stadium, state’s second international cricket venue after the Green park Stadium in Kanpur, has so far hosted a Twenty20 international game between India and West Indies in November 2018, and the Sunday’s match would be the maiden ODI for India at the venue.

The last time Lucknow hosted an international match was in January 1994 when India played a Test match against Sri Lanka at the KD Singh ‘Babu’ Stadium."

In what could be a huge blow to organising the 13th edition of Indian Premier League (IPL), a second meeting of the Group of Ministers on Wednesday cancelled all visas, except for a few official categories, till April 15 in the wake of the growing coronavirus scare.

In the meeting held at Nirman Bhavan here, it was decided that all existing visas, except diplomatic, official, UN/international organisations, employment and project visas, stand suspended till April 15 as the coronavirus outbreak has already seen over 60 positive cases in India.

The coronavirus outbreak was on Wednesday declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), whose chief expressed his “deep concern” over the “alarming levels of inaction” in combating the virus spread.

But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is still keeping their fingers crossed and have said that they will keep working closely with the concerned departments to ensure that all possible precautions are taken.

“The present scenario is a huge challenge for the BCCI-IPL and it is one where the circumstances are changing every few hours, and the BCCI has no control over these circumstances. As is usually the case in such situations, the BCCI would be in regular touch with the concerned departments to take the best possible course of action in the interest of the game, the players, the fans and the league,” a BCCI official told IANS.

The advisory from the Government of India does speak of exception for official visas and IPL franchises believe that could help as the ban would be for tourists looking to visit the country.

“See, there is an exception being made for those coming to India for official reasons. So we are still hoping that there shouldn’t be a problem in having our foreign recruits over for the tournament. Rest obviously depends on what the government feels is best, as public health is of utmost importance,” the official of an IPL franchise told IANS.

In fact, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly had recently made it clear that there was no reason to worry about the fate of the tournament as the board was taking all necessary precautions.

Ministers in Maharashtra and Karnataka have already written to the Centre to put the cash-rich league on hold and the new advisory from the government could see a new twist as far as the fate of the IPL is concerned.

Jonty Rhodes and Albie Morkel recreated old magic as their blistering knocks helped South Africa Legends beat West Indies Legends by six wickets in their Road Safety World Series match here on Wednesday. Chasing 144, South Africa was teetering at 42/4, but then Rhodes (53 not out) and Morkel (54 not out) took the opposition bowlers to cleansers and took their side home.

Rhodes rekindled the memories as he hammered six fours and one six and so did Morkel.

Their unbroken 104-run stand did the trick for their team.

There were expectations from Hershalle Gibbs, but he perished quickly.

Earlier, South Africa restricted West Indies Legends to 143/8 despite promising starts by openers Daren Ganga (31) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (21), who added 48 for the first wicket.

South Africa’s left-arm orthodox bowler Paul Harris (3-21) send both the openers back in quick succession.

He also dismissed the legendary Brian Lara (4) cheaply.

However, Ricardo Powell’s 30 and a quick-fire 23 by all-rounder Carl Hooper propelled West Indies to 143/8."

A cloud of uncertainty hung over the upcoming ICC Board meeting in Dubai owing to the novel Coronavirus outbreak, a report claimed on Wednesday. The ICC meetings are scheduled to be held between March 26 and 29 and are likely to initiate the bidding process for global events in the 2023-31 cycle of the Future Tours Programme.

“The status of the next set of ICC board meetings is in doubt due to travel restrictions emanating from the coronavirus epidemic that has disrupted movements across the globe,” ESPNCricinfo reported.

“The impact of the coronavirus in the UAE, where a number of sporting events have either been cancelled or played behind closed doors, and schools have been shut, means that the ICC, as well as its members, are monitoring and reviewing the status of those meetings,” the report added.

The country has so far reported 74 cases of people being infected with the virus.

If the ICC meetings are postponed, it will be the second time a key cricket meeting will be taken out of Dubai. Earlier this month, the members of the Asian Cricket Council were scheduled to meet there to discuss the venue for the Asia Cup, but deferred due to concerns over the coronavirus.

The ICC’s final decision is expected either on Thursday, or next week but alternative options could include postponement or video conferences, the report added."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:29 IST

Saurashtra, after keeping Bengal bowlers busy for 160 overs over two days, batted out another 70 minutes on the third morning of the Ranji Trophy final here on Wednesday. By adding 38 more runs to the overnight total, the hosts added to the enormity of challenge before Bengal.

Cheteshwar Pujara has back spasms and will bat only if absolutely necessary. If things go according to the home side’s script, he may have done enough. Bengal, 291 runs behind Saurashtra’s first-innings 425, will need to bat out the entire fourth day to stop the hosts from creating history.

Chasing 425 on a very slow Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium wicket, the visitors knew before the innings began that the game could well be decided on the first innings lead.

The hosts’ plans were exactly on those lines, and the players didn’t lack effort when their left-arm-seamers, skipper Jaydev Unadkat, the tournament’s highest wicket-taker, and the raw Chintan Sakariya, opened the bowling. There was constant chatter from the slips. As the batsmen played out the new ball without alarm, the cordon would slip in a reminder, ‘left-arm-spin baaki hai’. The synchronised claps that Saurashtra are known for were on too, to keep the bowlers’ sprits high. There was a ‘Saurashtra jeetega’ chorus from the crowd too; everything to make Bengal feel not at home.

While Ravindra Jadeja is on India duty, Dharmendra, Saurashtra’s other left-arm spinning Jadeja, came on, in the ninth over. Jadeja, a master of his craft in home conditions—not a big turner of the ball but one who knows exactly where to pitch on the Khanderi track, took the first Bengal wicket, debutant opener Sudip Gharami out to a catch at short-leg in the 14th over.

Next to go was Bengal captain Abhimanyu Easwaran, falling to a contentious leg before decision. The partial DRS controversy was waiting to pop up and it did when Easwaran was given out on nine to a Prerak Mankad in-swinger. The batsman sought a review, and it appeared to be missing leg-stump. But with no ball-tracking technology available, the third umpire had to go with the on-field umpire’s call with the batsman struck in line with leg-stump.

The Pujara template of patience and perseverance has borne fruit on this track for years, and Bengal adopted the same tactics. By the time two sessions were over, Bengal were only 94/2 in 42 overs with their best hope Manoj Tiwary and a confident Sudip Chatterjee together.

Tiwary, playing his 100th Ranji match, received a reprieve, bowled of a Chirag Jani no-ball on 18 after lunch. But he could not capitalise, this time playing outside the line and falling leg before to Jani. In came Wriddhiman Saha with a point to prove, after being made to sit out in New Zealand due to lesser batting skills than Rishab Pant. The Saha-Chatterjee partnership that remained unbroken, batting out 13 overs scoring 10 runs, was the most fascinating of the day.

Unadkat having taken 65 wickets this season, the stage was set to showcase another facet of his armoury that got Saurashtra into the final. He bowled a remarkable spell of reverse swing, aided by Sakariya doing the same from the other end. It challenged the defence of the right-left batting combination to the full. Sakariya seemed to have got Chatterjee leg before with a delivery that angled back from off-stump. But the decision was reversed by the TV umpire, adjudicating that the ball had hit the bat first.

Pujara has back-spasms and will bat only if absolutely necessary. If things go according to the home side’s script, he may have done enough. Bengal, 291 runs behind Saurashtra’s first-innings 425, will need to bat out the entire fourth day to stop the hosts from creating history.

Pitch controversy

The slow and low pitch continued to attract attention with SCA curator Mahendra Rajdev questioning Bengal coach Arun Lal for dubbing the wicket ‘poor’. “It is a rather hasty and poor judgement by the Bengal coach and it may not be beneficial for their own players when the coach makes a statement like this. It is the same pitch for both the teams and was prepared under the neutral curator from BCCI,” he said.

At the end of the day, responding to Rajdev’s comments, Lal maintained his stand. “The ball is reaching two bounces to the keeper. It is not a Ranji Trophy final wicket. It is an under-watered and poor wicket,” he said."

While sports events around the world, from soccer to sumo, are being held behind closed doors because of the novel coronavirus outbreak, the India cricket team’s home game will be a damp squib if held without its army of fanatical supporters who act as the twelfth man.

Thursday’s ODI between India and South Africa, the first of a 3-game series, will witness crowds not just from Dharamsala and elsewhere in Himachal Pradesh but also from neighbouring states. However, that raises the threat of coronavirus in a state that depends a lot on tourism for revenue and thankfully hasn’t seen a single positive case.

Both teams, carrying instructions from their doctors, are taking precautions—Proteas will not shake hands—but there are certain things they cannot avoid. Like using saliva to shine the ball or being rude to fans who approach them.

India pace bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, returning from injury, put things in perspective.

“You can’t say it is dangerous because it has just started in India, but we are taking whatever precautions we can. We have a team doctor who is telling us the dos and don’ts. We are hoping it doesn’t go beyond a limit,” he said on Wednesday.

The team doctors have given some basic advice like washing hands often and keep extra focus on personal hygiene. However, in a game of cricket, players can’t be that choosy.

For example, maintaining the condition of the ball to get it to swing matters a lot. Swing is bread and butter for Bhuvneshwar. To ensure it swings—it can even reverse in a 50-over game—players have to work on the ball using saliva, which can be fraught with risk.

Asked about this, Bhuvneshwar made his clear where his priority lies.

“We have thought about it but if we don’t use saliva, how will we shine the ball? And then we’ll get thrashed and you will say we are not bowling well. But yeah, we have a team doctor travelling with us, we’ll discuss with him and we’ll go with his advice,” he said.

“When it comes to (avoiding) fans, these things we can’t do. In these times, we should try and not go very close to them on our own,” he added, although cricketers rarely get close to fans given the ring of high security.

Hosts Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association has put out information. It has put up boards listing on the precautions to be taken, like avoiding large crowds, although it is a bit out of place as fans will flock to the stadium. It advises people to wear the mask properly. Other directions are to wash hands regularly and get body temperature checked.

HPCA realises a single positive case can hurt the state’s tourism. While the report of all arrivals at the Dharamsala airport is being sent to the Chief Medical Officer, the number of doctors on duty at the HPCA Stadium for the match have gone up from four to 10.

“We are doing this to spread awareness as there will be a mass gathering. There are special thermal thermometres (with infra-red rays) kept in medical areas. Anyone having problems can have temperature checked and the report can be sent to Pune (laboratory),” said a HPCA official."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 01:18 IST

The spread of the novel coronavirus—declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on Wednesday—looks set to impact the almost two-month long Indian Premier League starting on March 29. The Maharashtra government, which discussed outbreak, asked on Wednesday if IPL matches can be postponed, cancelled or even held in empty stadiums.

“BCCI is ready to hold the IPL tournament without audience. It means there will be no sale of tickets. However, we are yet to receive any official request. We will consider it after receiving. If necessary, the IPL matches can be postponed,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said.

Thackeray as well as health minister Rajesh Tope seemed to be in favour of not holding the matches. “No final decision is taken on the issue,” Tope said.

With the number of positive cases in India hitting 60 on Wednesday, there is fear that the large crowds at IPL games will pose a serious contagion risk.

BCCI, however, is in a fix.

“There are spectators for many matches being played in the country currently. That said, we are monitoring the situation. The IPL governing council is meeting on Saturday (Mar 14). That’s when we will look at all the factors and take a decision,” IPL chairman Brijesh Patel told Hindustan Times.

With defending champions Mumbai Indians due to host the season’s first IPL game against Chennai Super Kings in Mumbai on March 29, this is a major administrative challenge for the Sourav Ganguly-led BCCI.

It will directly impact Mumbai Indians, whose home matches are usually played before packed houses in the 33,000 capacity Wankhede Stadium. The government decision also covers Navi Mumbai and Pune, which rules out shifting the venue within the state.

According to industry experts, if the BCCI is forced to hold matches in empty stadiums across the country, franchise earnings will take a massive hit. “The leading franchises who stage their matches in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata would lose anywhere in the range of ~30-40 crore from gate receipts,” an ex-franchise official said.

Even franchises who play home matches in Jaipur (Rajasthan Royals), Mohali (KXIP) and Hyderabad (Sunrisers Hyderabad) would lose between ~16-20 crore in gate collection though the ticket revenue is not as high as the top five because of lower prices and relatively lesser demand.

“That apart, you lose money on merchandise and sale of confectioneries, although that does not amount to more than ~50 lakh to ~1 crore,” said another former franchise official from a team based in the north.

Other states scheduled to host IPL matches are yet to announce any measures to fight the spread of the virus; in fact, a three-match ODI series between India and South Africa, to be played in Dharamshala (March 12), Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18), is going ahead without any restrictions.

Late on Wednesday, India also suspended all existing visas in their latest travel advisory, though official and work visas—which are used by the overseas players for the IPL—are exempt.

Franchises are already upset with the BCCI’s 50% cut in playoff fund amount for franchises (from ~50 crore to ~25 crore), and increased expenditure of ~1.4 crore a season, payable to staging associations.

Niranjan Shah, former secretary of BCCI and president of Saurashtra Cricket Association, said the association would be happy to host Mumbai Indians if required. “The coronavirus hasn’t impacted Gujarat yet. If we are offered, we will be happy to host the matches in Rajkot. But it all depends on how the virus impact unfolds,” he said.

A senior board official said it was not contemplating playing the entire IPL without spectators as of now. Efforts are on to see if alternate venues can hold matches if any state refuses permission. A Rajasthan Royals official said: “We’re not taking any call until we receive an official communication on coronavirus from BCCI.” At stake also is the ~16,347.5 crore Star India pays BCCI for the TV and digital rights of the league. Cancelling the IPL would hit the broadcasters to the tune of ~3000 crore. Postponing the tournament is also not possible given the cramped cricket calendar, non-availability of overseas players, and this being a World Cup year.

ICC meets in doubt

Some key ICC meetings scheduled in March-end in Dubai are set to be postponed due to the coronavirus spread in the region. ICC is expected to make it official soon. The Asian Cricket Council meeting, scheduled in Dubai, too could not happen on time because to the same reason.

The BCCI, undecided on who to send for the ICC AGM, would not mind the delay. The ICC was to discuss several contentious issues, including arriving at a consensus on the 2023-31 FTP."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:20 IST

A day after he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jyotiraditya Scindia was welcomed by Home Minister Amit Shah.

“Met Shri @JM_Scindia ji. I am sure his induction into the party will further strengthen BJP’s resolve to serve the people of Madhya Pradesh,” Shah said on Twitter. He also posted a photo of hugging and greeting Scindia.

Scindia, the Madhya Pradesh politician whose surprise exit from the Congress has brought the Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday. Scindia joined the BJP at an event in national capital Delhi in the presence of party chief JP Nadda.

Scindia had ended his 18-year-old association with the Congress on Tuesday after meetings with Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had thanked PM Modi and Shah for making him a part of their family.

In his resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi that Scindia put out on Twitter soon after, he alluded to his discomfort in the party over the last year or so. “...as you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year,” he had written in his letter.

It was seen as a reference to the Congress settling for Kamal Nath as the chief minister after the 2018 state elections though it was Scindia who had led from the front to oust the BJP from Madhya Pradesh. Scindia’s supporters had hoped that the Congress would tell Kamal Nath to give up his second charge - as the party chief in the state - but this also didn’t happen.

Scindia’s grandmother, Vijaya Raje Scindia, was one of the founders of the Jana Sangh, the precursor to the BJP. His aunt Vasundhara Raje is a former Union minister and ex-chief minister of Rajasthan and another aunt Yashodhara Raje is a former minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet."

As said earlier, many users on Twitter have pointed out that “Disney+” content are missing from the Hotstar app, a quick search on the Android version showed series like “The Mandalorian”. However, other top Disney+ Originals like “The World According to Jeff Goldblum” were missing after the update. As expected, some users aren’t very happy with the move.

The only flaw in Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited is that he does not have the Whitman brothers—Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman—ride across the sumptuous Indian countryside on a Royal Enfield motorcycle. (They ride a Honda, which, I guess, is fair. Honda owns 26% of the motorcycle market in India.)

But I would have made it a Royal Enfield. The Indian connection is perfect: The formerly British brand is a publicly offered subsidiary of Eicher Motors Ltd. and located in Chennai, India; it manufactures all of the 900,000 bikes it sells worldwide each year there, too. (Design and engineering are handled out of the Bruntingthrope Proving Ground near Leicester, England, and in Chennai, India.) Myriad Bollywood stars, plus Brad Pitt, are fans.

Most important, Royal Enfield motorcycles have the same vintage feel and styling—like threadworn but chic mustard-yellow corduroy—that makes Anderson’s movies so charming. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 I rode for a week in Los Angeles is not the smoothest, the fastest, or the most efficient of the motorcycles I’ve ridden recently. But with the cool vintage styling, affordable performance, and reliable construction that match the promise of its brand, it’s the most endearing.

Iconic and Affordable

You’ve probably heard the name before. Royal Enfield is the brand name under which the Enfield Cycle Company of Worchestershire, England, produced motorcycles, bicycles, and even lawnmowers after incorporating in 1896. It made its first motorcycle in 1901.

It’s the oldest continually produced motorcycle brand in the world. During World War II, the British War Office used the Royal Enfield WD/RE, aka “Flying Flea,” to transport messages between airborne and ground troops; the bike was so light it could be dropped by parachute or carried in gliders. The company’s old-world, military-style Bullet models from the early 1930s are the most recognizable from the early days, though the original Interceptors made from 1960 to 1970 look cooler.

In 2015, it surpassed Harley-Davidson in global motorcycle sales, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in the U.S. who actually owns one—the brand sold just 3,500 motorcycles in the U.S. in 2019. Breean Poland, the head of marketing for Royal Enfield in America, says that’s changing: “We have consistently increased sales and dealership presence year over year since taking over ownership of sales and distribution in 2016,” she said in an email. “Our [650-engine] lineup and affordability has put us in a prime position to capitalize on a segment that we feel many manufacturers are overlooking.”

Royal Enfield North America currently offers the Bullet 500, Classic 500, Himalayan, and the all-new 650 Twin motorcycles (the INT 650 and Continental GT 650) in the U.S. market. The modern Interceptor I rode was introduced in 2018. Known in the U.S. as INT650, it carries the same look as the original: a single round headlight up front, classic teardrop tank, wide-set and upright handlebars, and a flat seat perfect for two riders.

I loved the bike because of how inexpensive it was—just $5,799 for the one I rode, painted in straight-from-the 1970s Orange Crush—without sacrificing such period-correct details as that headlight, the clean lines, and the perfect diamond-quilted black-leather seat you could imagine sitting on while riding through Laurel Canyon with your beau. (Other colour options for the gas tank, such as the cool $6,499 Glitter and Dust silver tone, cost marginally more.)

The 18-inch, 36-spoke aluminum alloy wheels with Pirelli tires were specifically made for this model; the twin-pod instrument cluster with small digital instrument screens is simple to read; the wide-braced handlebars allow for a commanding view of the road and an upright seating position.

Down for the Ride

As I stepped onto the bike for the first time one late February afternoon, I noticed that the 804-mm (31-inch) seat ride height would be easily rideable for shorter riders under 5-foot-5 tall, especially those wearing boots. (Taller riders such as myself, and those who prefer the tall, upright feel of dirt- and touring bikes, may find it slightly low.) It started easily with one press on the tiny lever under my thumb; cold starts are no issue here. The air- and oil-cooled, 648-cc parallel-twin engine gargled to life; I smoothly twisted the throttle and swung out of the driveway and onto the street.

The INT650 has 47 horsepower on its 202kg (445 pound) body—plenty of grit and thrust to stay stable at 60 mph and 70 mph on the highway, though heavier, larger and more experienced riders will quickly wish for more power. It comes with six quick speeds, ABS and a forgiving, piggyback reservoir suspension chosen for its clean and modern look in the rear subframe. As I wound through downtown L.A., I found it to have a good lean angle and easy handling across tight turns and pivots in the road. It worked best winding through the galleries and cafes of L.A.’s arts district and cruising over the historic concrete bridges of the Los Angeles River.

Even better, the gas tank holds 4.8 gallons and gets roughly 60-70 miles per gallon depending on how aggressively you ride.

Longtime riders will notice that the INT650 is neither as smooth nor refined as a Ducati or Triumph bike, or as hefty underneath as a BMW rNineT. But Royal Enfield amply fulfills its promise to deliver “iconic and affordable” motorbikes. It proves you don’t have to pay the premium ($14,000 for the Triumph Scrambler; $8,699 for the Harley-Davidson Street Rod) to own something that harkens back to easy, cool, California carefree living.

The Interceptor 650 certainly qualifies for that distinction. It was a joy to ride. After one week with it, I was ready to film a Darjeeling Limited of my own.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:47 IST

South Korea is one such country which has succeeded in cutting down the number of coronavirus infections after being one of the worst-hit outside China. Even though on Thursday it reported 114 new cases of coronavirus and six more deaths, the numbers are far lower than the peak of 909 cases reported on February 29, news agency Reuters reported. Health officials say the trend does appear to be slowing in what has been the largest outbreak in Asia outside of China.

South Korea’s trace, track and test approach seems to have been working in its favour, something which the South Indian state of Kerala also seem to have tried recently to contain the rise in coronavirus cases.

On Wednesday, Pathanamthitta district administration released two sets of maps giving a detailed account of three people’s travel after they arrived at the Cochin International Airport on February 29. The chart gives an account of their movement from the airport to their hospitalisation on March 6.

The three travellers flew in from Italy and slipped out of the Cochin International Airport after dodging health authorities. They surfaced after testing positive for the novel coronavirus and are believed to have transmitted the virus to eight of their relatives.

“It was a laborious job. This flowchart helps people who came in contact with them to get tested for possible infection,” said district collector PB Nooh.

The maps were prepared with the help of health officials, the police, locals and relatives of the three people and exhibit a detailed account of all the places they had visited. According to the maps, the three patients had visited banks, hotels, bakeries, a church, hospitals, a bar and had taken public transport.

The South Korean authorities are also reported to have been vigorously tracing down the contacts of all those who tested positive for the virus. The infected individuals would also be traced back to at least 14 days to understand the possible spread of the virus. The process would even include tracking their credit card use, CCTV footage and mobile phone activity, news agency AFP reported.

Kerala continues to be on a coronavirus high alert. The total number of people under observation has crossed 3,000, state Health Minister KK Shailaja said on Wednesday.

“Of the 1,179 samples sent for testing, today 889 samples report came and all were negative and we are waiting for the results of another 213. As on date, we have 14 people who are positive and are under close observation,” said Shailaja yesterday.

The first three positive cases of coronavirus in India were confirmed in Kerala, all of them had recovered successfully.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 73 as on Thursday morning in India. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection."

Highlights Alessia Bonari post shows the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with coronavirus

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds

Her post has gone extremely viral

Coronavirus has become a huge health threat across the world with the number of people affected going up day after day. In the midst of this, an Italian nurse has shared the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with the virus. Alessia Bonari admits in her post that she’s afraid to go to work and feels tired but will continue to do her job. A selfie of herself that she posted shows her face bruised by the mask she has to wear while working.

“I am a nurse and right now I am facing this medical emergency. I’m afraid too, but not going to go shopping, I’m afraid to go to work,” says the post when translated from Italian. She goes on to list some of the things that worry her on a daily basis during her job.

“I’m afraid because the mask may not adhere well to the face, or I may have accidentally touched myself with dirty gloves, or maybe the lenses do not completely cover my eyes and something may have passed,” she says.

“I am physically tired because the protective devices are bad, the lab coat makes me sweat and once dressed I can no longer go to the bathroom or drink for six hours,” she adds.

The whole thing is taking a toll on her psychologically as well and she isn’t alone in feeling this way. But she adds that this will not stop her or her colleagues to do their work.

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds.

She ends her post by appealing to people to be selfless, safe and protect others during these trying times.

“I can’t afford the luxury of going back to my quarantined house, I have to go to work and do my part. You do yours, I ask you please,” she says.

Bonari’s post has collected over 7.3 lakh likes on Instagram and thousands of comments. People are thanking Bonari and other medical professionals like her who are treating those in need.

“You are an example Alessia, we are all with you. You are angels. Good job,” says a comment when translated from Italian. “Thank you very much for all you do,” says another. “Respect for you and all your colleagues,” reads a third.

Coronavirus has caused 827 deaths in Italy. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, Italy has shut down all stores except pharmacies and food shops.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 01:18 IST

The spread of the novel coronavirus—declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on Wednesday—looks set to impact the almost two-month long Indian Premier League starting on March 29. The Maharashtra government, which discussed outbreak, asked on Wednesday if IPL matches can be postponed, cancelled or even held in empty stadiums.

“BCCI is ready to hold the IPL tournament without audience. It means there will be no sale of tickets. However, we are yet to receive any official request. We will consider it after receiving. If necessary, the IPL matches can be postponed,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said.

Thackeray as well as health minister Rajesh Tope seemed to be in favour of not holding the matches. “No final decision is taken on the issue,” Tope said.

With the number of positive cases in India hitting 60 on Wednesday, there is fear that the large crowds at IPL games will pose a serious contagion risk.

BCCI, however, is in a fix.

“There are spectators for many matches being played in the country currently. That said, we are monitoring the situation. The IPL governing council is meeting on Saturday (Mar 14). That’s when we will look at all the factors and take a decision,” IPL chairman Brijesh Patel told Hindustan Times.

With defending champions Mumbai Indians due to host the season’s first IPL game against Chennai Super Kings in Mumbai on March 29, this is a major administrative challenge for the Sourav Ganguly-led BCCI.

It will directly impact Mumbai Indians, whose home matches are usually played before packed houses in the 33,000 capacity Wankhede Stadium. The government decision also covers Navi Mumbai and Pune, which rules out shifting the venue within the state.

According to industry experts, if the BCCI is forced to hold matches in empty stadiums across the country, franchise earnings will take a massive hit. “The leading franchises who stage their matches in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata would lose anywhere in the range of ~30-40 crore from gate receipts,” an ex-franchise official said.

Even franchises who play home matches in Jaipur (Rajasthan Royals), Mohali (KXIP) and Hyderabad (Sunrisers Hyderabad) would lose between ~16-20 crore in gate collection though the ticket revenue is not as high as the top five because of lower prices and relatively lesser demand.

“That apart, you lose money on merchandise and sale of confectioneries, although that does not amount to more than ~50 lakh to ~1 crore,” said another former franchise official from a team based in the north.

Other states scheduled to host IPL matches are yet to announce any measures to fight the spread of the virus; in fact, a three-match ODI series between India and South Africa, to be played in Dharamshala (March 12), Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18), is going ahead without any restrictions.

Late on Wednesday, India also suspended all existing visas in their latest travel advisory, though official and work visas—which are used by the overseas players for the IPL—are exempt.

Franchises are already upset with the BCCI’s 50% cut in playoff fund amount for franchises (from ~50 crore to ~25 crore), and increased expenditure of ~1.4 crore a season, payable to staging associations.

Niranjan Shah, former secretary of BCCI and president of Saurashtra Cricket Association, said the association would be happy to host Mumbai Indians if required. “The coronavirus hasn’t impacted Gujarat yet. If we are offered, we will be happy to host the matches in Rajkot. But it all depends on how the virus impact unfolds,” he said.

A senior board official said it was not contemplating playing the entire IPL without spectators as of now. Efforts are on to see if alternate venues can hold matches if any state refuses permission. A Rajasthan Royals official said: “We’re not taking any call until we receive an official communication on coronavirus from BCCI.” At stake also is the ~16,347.5 crore Star India pays BCCI for the TV and digital rights of the league. Cancelling the IPL would hit the broadcasters to the tune of ~3000 crore. Postponing the tournament is also not possible given the cramped cricket calendar, non-availability of overseas players, and this being a World Cup year.

ICC meets in doubt

Some key ICC meetings scheduled in March-end in Dubai are set to be postponed due to the coronavirus spread in the region. ICC is expected to make it official soon. The Asian Cricket Council meeting, scheduled in Dubai, too could not happen on time because to the same reason.

The BCCI, undecided on who to send for the ICC AGM, would not mind the delay. The ICC was to discuss several contentious issues, including arriving at a consensus on the 2023-31 FTP."

Ticket sales in Maharashtra for the 2020 Indian Premier League opener between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings have been banned by the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, according to a report on CNBC-TV 18. The measure has reportedly been taken to avoid the gathering of a large number of people amid the spread of coronavirus in the country.

The match is scheduled to be held on March 29 and will be the first of the 13th season of the IPL which will continue till May 24 across various venues around the country.

Mumbai went into high alert after two persons tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total afflicted in the state to 7, including 5 in Pune, an official said here on Wednesday.

Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had earlier said that the government may consider postponing the IPL because of the threat posed by the virus that has claimed over 3000 lives around the world.

“There is always a possible danger of spread (of contagious diseases) when large numbers of people gather in one place... Such (IPL) events can always be organised later,” Tope told mediapersons on Saturday.

He said that discussions are currently on in official circles whether to postpone the IPL and a decision would be announced shortly.

Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sourav Ganguly had asserted that there would be no change in the IPL schedule.

“We will take all precautions. I don’t know exactly what these are, it’s only the medical team which will tell us about that. The medical team is already in touch with the hospitals so that everything is available,” Ganguly had said, adding that the organisers would abide by the advice of the doctors."

Pujara did not take the field on day three after pulling a back muscle during warm-up as Bengal reached 134/3 in their first innings at close of play, trailing Saurashtra by 291 runs.

“Pujara pulled his back while warm-up. He then went to the hospital for a scan. He will only bat if required,” Saurashtra Cricket Association president Jaydev Shah told PTI.

Opener Liton Das maintained his superb form as Bangladesh thrashed Zimbabwe by nine wickets in the second Twenty20 international to clinch the two-match series 2-0 in Dhaka on Wednesday.

Liton hit an unbeaten 60 off 45 balls, his second fifty on the trot, which followed two brilliant centuries in the preceding one-day international series, as Bangladesh reached 120-1 in 15.5 overs after restricting Zimbabwe to 119-7.

Chasing a modest target, Liton struck eight fours as he took the excitement out of the game in a 77-run opening stand.

Naim, who replaced the rested Tamim Iqbal, made 33 runs before he became the only batsman to be dismissed in Bangladesh’s innings as Tinashe Kamunhukamwe took the catch off Chris Mpofu at mid-wicket.

Soumya Sarkar remained unbeaten on 20 and finished the game off alongside Liton with a single from Mpofu as Bangladesh reached their target with 25 balls to spare.

Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad heaped praise on Liton for his consistent performance throughout the series.

“The way we played is pleasing to see. Especially Liton has batted outstandingly well. It shows his maturity and hunger,” he said.

Former skipper Brendan Taylor earlier hit an unbeaten 59 off 48 balls with six fours and a six to give Zimbabwe innings some respectability.

Taylor posted 57 runs with Craig Ervine, who made 29, for the second wicket but the Bangladesh bowlers maintained a tight line to put Zimbabwe under pressure.

Al-Amin Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman claimed 2-22 and 2-25 respectively for Bangladesh.

Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams urged his teammates “to stay positive.”

“Things happen quickly in T20 cricket. It’s just not happening for us at the moment. (We) need to reflect on ourselves,” Williams said.

Bangladesh also won the preceding one-day international series 3-0 and one-off Test by an innings and 106 runs."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 20:02 IST

There seems to be a divine connection between India-South Africa matches and Dharamsala. Unlike most cases though, the divine connection is not exactly the most desired one. The last time these two sides came here, the T20I was washed out without a ball being bowled in September 2019. Chances of history repeating itself are high when India face South Africa in the first ODI on Wednesday as rain is expected to spoilsport.

After the two sides completed their practice sessions, heavy rains lashed out at the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala which forced the ground staff to cover the entire ground with covers. India, which copped a thrashing at the hands of New Zealand, would look to get back to winning ways, but weather could prove to be South Africa’s ally in South Africa.

“International matches are important. We just lost a series in New Zealand and you all are aware of the reactions after that. Our aim is to win the series because if we don’t do well, an individual’s confidence also gets affected,” Bhuvneshwar said on the eve of the first ODI between India and South Africa here on Thursday.

South Africa, on the other hand, beat Australia 3-0 n the ODI series and look to be a side in form.

Australia will be banking on their top order as they seek to end their five-match winless streak in one-day internationals against a buoyant New Zealand in the three-match series beginning in Sydney on Friday. Aaron Finch’s men are smarting from a 3-0 whitewash in South Africa earlier this month, which followed their 2-1 series defeat in India, and their top order look exhausted after 12 months of relentless cricket.

In New Zealand, they meet a side brimming with confidence having just whitewashed India both in the ODI and test series.

Opener David Warner agreed the onus was on the frontline batsmen to fuel Australia’s bid to reclaim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.

“The only thing I can put it (Australia’s losing streak) down to is the top four not scoring the bulk of the runs,” Warner told reporters on Wednesday.

“You can’t do it all the time but at least one of us (has to) go on and be there at the end.

“It is disappointing but at the end of the day we’ve got to keep trying to get better at that, try to find a balance with our batting through the middle as well.”

Team mate Matthew Wade agreed with Warner’s diagnosis and said they need to do better against a New Zealand side renowned for their discipline in all aspects of the game.

“We’ve got to make sure one of the top four really bats through and makes a big hundred and in Australia we back our power towards the end on pretty true wickets,” said Wade.

“It’ll be nice to see if one of the top order can go through and bat the whole innings, that would be very helpful.”

New Zealand have welcomed their fit-again pace trio of Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson, who powered their run to the final of the World Cup last year.

Coach Gary Stead said his team considered Australia a “benchmark” but will carry the confidence from their excellent performance against India.

“They are a great team, we respect them a lot for the way they play their cricket... They set a benchmark for us to aspire to,” Stead said.

“I think we have played some really good ODI cricket in the last three or four years and hopefully we can continue that.”

Sydney hosts the second match as well on Sunday before teams move to Hobart for the last ODI on Friday."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 19:13 IST

Coronavirus outbreak has forced Bangladesh Cricket Board to postpone the World XI v Asia XI matches which was slated to be held in order to mark the birthday celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, referred to as father of the nation. Last month, the BCB had announced high profile names in Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle, Faf du Plessis as the key players who would have been a part of the matches between Asia XI and World XI.

“There’s no guarantee that those who are supposed to play will be able to arrive, or can leave after the matches,” ESPN Cricinfo quoted BCB president Nazmul Hasan as saying.

“There are a lot of restrictions, so we have deferred both programmes. We will organise after a month taking stock of the situation. It is postponed for the time being,” he added.

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:24 IST

After the drubbing they received in New Zealand, India are back home, but they will be on their toes against South Africa, especially because of the cool and wet weather in Dharamsala. While Kohli’s troops copped a thrashing at the hands of New Zealand, South Africa were ruthless against Australia as they bagged the series 3-0.

The upcoming series will all boil down to different players taking up responsibility and making their presence felt and here in this article, we take a look at the three-player battles which could define the result of the match.

Lungi Ngidi vs Virat Kohli

With 27 wickets in 14 matches, Ngidi is South Africa’s most successful bowler in ODIs since 2019. His performance this year has been prolific, picking up 12 wickets in 4 matches. He was brilliant in the series against England and Australia and will be a threat for the Indian team.

Team India captain Virat Kohli had a forgettable series in New Zealand and he will be keen to hit back and find his mojo. However, in Ngidi, he will have a tough proposition and this battle will have a telling impact on the contest.

Jasprit Bumrah vs Quinton de Kock

The South African captain loves the Indian bowling attack and boasts of a mighty impressive record against them. He also averages over 63 in away ODIs against India and will be keen to lead from the front with the bat.

He will be up against Jasprit Bumrah, who did not have a good series in New Zealand in the limited-overs format, but hit his stride in the second Test match. A firing Bumrah at the top of the order is critical to India’s causes and this contest will be important as far as the result of the match is concerned.

Yuzvendra Chahal vs Faf du Plesssis

The battle in the middle order will be extremely important for both the sides and it will be fought between Yuzvendra Chahal and Faf du Plessis. Chahal has taken 20 wickets against South Africa in seven matches and this is the most for him against any opposition.

Faf, on the other hand, will be keen to drive home his importance to the side and he has the backing of captain Quinton de Kock. “Faf plays big role for us from a leadership point of view. He’s here to help out a lot of the younger guys in the team, and he still adds a lot of value to us and he also knows he has lot of value to give to this team,” De Kock told reporters ahead of the match."

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday said the PSL matches in Karachi will go ahead as per schedule despite the increase in number of positive novel coronavirus cases in the city.

The Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches are scheduled to be played in Karachi from March 12 to 17.

The Sindh government has confirmed that the total number of positive coronavirus cases in the province had jumped to 15, raising concerns about the spread of the disease. But the country’s national board said it has held constructive discussions with the provincial government and the two will work closely to ensure safety and health of the spectators.

“As it is always the case, the PCB is guided by the Sindh government in such matters. In this background, we are satisfied with the feedback the Sindh government has provided and the support it has assured,” the PCB said in a statement.

“At the same time, the PCB has promised the Sindh government that it will work very closely with its commercial partner and support wherever it can to assist in the health and safety of the spectators.” The PCB also urged the people to throng the National Stadium to watch the matches.

A number of directives have been issued to the spectators to ensure safety from the coronavirus which includes refraining from hugging or shaking hands, using soap and sanitizers inside the enclosure.

The PCB has also set up a temporary hospital at its high performance centre to deal with any cases with space for isolation of patients.

Schools and colleges have been shut down by the Sindh government till March 13 and a spokesman said a decision to extend the closure will be taken by Thursday."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 17:27 IST

South Africa captain Quinton de Kock believes India, under Virat Kohli, is an “unbelievable” team with great balance, but added that the visitors are also brimming with confidence and are ready for a fight in the three-match ODI series beginning Thursday.

India are coming into the series on the back of a series whitewash in New Zealand whereas the Proteas whitewashed Australia in their last ODI series back home.

“India is an unbelievable team, they have got great balance, but I am sure we are also coming here with a lot of confidence,” de Kock said on the eve of the first ODI on Wednesday.

The skipper also urged the senior members of the team -- including himself, Faf du Plessis and David Miller -- to take up responsibility and guide the youngsters against the Men in Blue.

du Plessis is making a comeback after being rested for the Australia series and de Kock feels his presence in the team will be vital.

“Obviously, Faf (du Plessis) has come back. He plays a big role for us from the leadership point of view. He is here to help out the younger guys in the team. He adds a lot of value for us. He also knows he has lot of value to give to this team. His experience will be a big help for us in this series,” de Kock said.

“We understand that we are coming here with quite an inexperienced side in these conditions but its important Faf, me, David Miller to help out these guys around, lead the way. Pass on our knowledge to the youngsters.”

du Plessis was rested for the ODI series against South Africa at home which the Proteas won 3-0 and de Kock feels that the former skipper needed that break to re-organise his thoughts.

“He (Du Plessis) was given a chance to have a break. It’s been a long season so I think it was important to let him put his feet up for a while, just re-organise his thoughts,” said de Kock

“Just glad to have him back with us. We are undecided where he is going to bat at the moment but we will come up with the decision later,” he added."

The two teams are coming into this series on the back of contrasting results. While India were blanked in the ODI and Test series respectively in New Zealand, the Proteas effected a stunning 3-0 whitewash over Australia at home. Despite this, former South Africa all-rounder Albie Morkel believes things aren’t going to be easy for the visitors in India.

“It was sort of a mixed summer before the new coaching staff took over,” Morkel was quoted as saying by Sportstar. “Obviously, they had a fantastic win against Australia in the ODI series, after losing the T20 series badly. So, I’m unsure.”

“Even if a team is in top form, beating India in India is almost an impossible task. It’s going be a tough series for them, but I do expect them to at least compete. India will win it 2-1, but South Africa should compete, especially now that they have the confidence after the series against Australia,” he added."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:20 IST

A day after he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jyotiraditya Scindia was welcomed by Home Minister Amit Shah.

“Met Shri @JM_Scindia ji. I am sure his induction into the party will further strengthen BJP’s resolve to serve the people of Madhya Pradesh,” Shah said on Twitter. He also posted a photo of hugging and greeting Scindia.

Scindia, the Madhya Pradesh politician whose surprise exit from the Congress has brought the Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday. Scindia joined the BJP at an event in national capital Delhi in the presence of party chief JP Nadda.

Scindia had ended his 18-year-old association with the Congress on Tuesday after meetings with Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had thanked PM Modi and Shah for making him a part of their family.

In his resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi that Scindia put out on Twitter soon after, he alluded to his discomfort in the party over the last year or so. “...as you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year,” he had written in his letter.

It was seen as a reference to the Congress settling for Kamal Nath as the chief minister after the 2018 state elections though it was Scindia who had led from the front to oust the BJP from Madhya Pradesh. Scindia’s supporters had hoped that the Congress would tell Kamal Nath to give up his second charge - as the party chief in the state - but this also didn’t happen.

Scindia’s grandmother, Vijaya Raje Scindia, was one of the founders of the Jana Sangh, the precursor to the BJP. His aunt Vasundhara Raje is a former Union minister and ex-chief minister of Rajasthan and another aunt Yashodhara Raje is a former minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet."

According to many users on Twitter, Disney+ content vanished after the company rolled out another update on late Wednesday. With the new update, the “Disney+ Hotstar” logo has reverted to the updated Hotstar logo.

Earlier, Hotstar in a statement clarified the availability of Disney+ content was part of a beta trial with limited number of users. It also pointed out that the official Disney+ India launch on Hotstar is still scheduled for March 29, as announced earlier.

“A limited release of the beta version of the Disney+ Hotstar app is currently being tested with a small number of consumers, in preparation for the full-fledged app launch on 29th March,” a Hotstar spokesperson said following the availability of Disney+ content in India.

The only flaw in Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited is that he does not have the Whitman brothers—Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman—ride across the sumptuous Indian countryside on a Royal Enfield motorcycle. (They ride a Honda, which, I guess, is fair. Honda owns 26% of the motorcycle market in India.)

But I would have made it a Royal Enfield. The Indian connection is perfect: The formerly British brand is a publicly offered subsidiary of Eicher Motors Ltd. and located in Chennai, India; it manufactures all of the 900,000 bikes it sells worldwide each year there, too. (Design and engineering are handled out of the Bruntingthrope Proving Ground near Leicester, England, and in Chennai, India.) Myriad Bollywood stars, plus Brad Pitt, are fans.

Most important, Royal Enfield motorcycles have the same vintage feel and styling—like threadworn but chic mustard-yellow corduroy—that makes Anderson’s movies so charming. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 I rode for a week in Los Angeles is not the smoothest, the fastest, or the most efficient of the motorcycles I’ve ridden recently. But with the cool vintage styling, affordable performance, and reliable construction that match the promise of its brand, it’s the most endearing.

Iconic and Affordable

You’ve probably heard the name before. Royal Enfield is the brand name under which the Enfield Cycle Company of Worchestershire, England, produced motorcycles, bicycles, and even lawnmowers after incorporating in 1896. It made its first motorcycle in 1901.

It’s the oldest continually produced motorcycle brand in the world. During World War II, the British War Office used the Royal Enfield WD/RE, aka “Flying Flea,” to transport messages between airborne and ground troops; the bike was so light it could be dropped by parachute or carried in gliders. The company’s old-world, military-style Bullet models from the early 1930s are the most recognizable from the early days, though the original Interceptors made from 1960 to 1970 look cooler.

In 2015, it surpassed Harley-Davidson in global motorcycle sales, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in the U.S. who actually owns one—the brand sold just 3,500 motorcycles in the U.S. in 2019. Breean Poland, the head of marketing for Royal Enfield in America, says that’s changing: “We have consistently increased sales and dealership presence year over year since taking over ownership of sales and distribution in 2016,” she said in an email. “Our [650-engine] lineup and affordability has put us in a prime position to capitalize on a segment that we feel many manufacturers are overlooking.”

Royal Enfield North America currently offers the Bullet 500, Classic 500, Himalayan, and the all-new 650 Twin motorcycles (the INT 650 and Continental GT 650) in the U.S. market. The modern Interceptor I rode was introduced in 2018. Known in the U.S. as INT650, it carries the same look as the original: a single round headlight up front, classic teardrop tank, wide-set and upright handlebars, and a flat seat perfect for two riders.

I loved the bike because of how inexpensive it was—just $5,799 for the one I rode, painted in straight-from-the 1970s Orange Crush—without sacrificing such period-correct details as that headlight, the clean lines, and the perfect diamond-quilted black-leather seat you could imagine sitting on while riding through Laurel Canyon with your beau. (Other colour options for the gas tank, such as the cool $6,499 Glitter and Dust silver tone, cost marginally more.)

The 18-inch, 36-spoke aluminum alloy wheels with Pirelli tires were specifically made for this model; the twin-pod instrument cluster with small digital instrument screens is simple to read; the wide-braced handlebars allow for a commanding view of the road and an upright seating position.

Down for the Ride

As I stepped onto the bike for the first time one late February afternoon, I noticed that the 804-mm (31-inch) seat ride height would be easily rideable for shorter riders under 5-foot-5 tall, especially those wearing boots. (Taller riders such as myself, and those who prefer the tall, upright feel of dirt- and touring bikes, may find it slightly low.) It started easily with one press on the tiny lever under my thumb; cold starts are no issue here. The air- and oil-cooled, 648-cc parallel-twin engine gargled to life; I smoothly twisted the throttle and swung out of the driveway and onto the street.

The INT650 has 47 horsepower on its 202kg (445 pound) body—plenty of grit and thrust to stay stable at 60 mph and 70 mph on the highway, though heavier, larger and more experienced riders will quickly wish for more power. It comes with six quick speeds, ABS and a forgiving, piggyback reservoir suspension chosen for its clean and modern look in the rear subframe. As I wound through downtown L.A., I found it to have a good lean angle and easy handling across tight turns and pivots in the road. It worked best winding through the galleries and cafes of L.A.’s arts district and cruising over the historic concrete bridges of the Los Angeles River.

Even better, the gas tank holds 4.8 gallons and gets roughly 60-70 miles per gallon depending on how aggressively you ride.

Longtime riders will notice that the INT650 is neither as smooth nor refined as a Ducati or Triumph bike, or as hefty underneath as a BMW rNineT. But Royal Enfield amply fulfills its promise to deliver “iconic and affordable” motorbikes. It proves you don’t have to pay the premium ($14,000 for the Triumph Scrambler; $8,699 for the Harley-Davidson Street Rod) to own something that harkens back to easy, cool, California carefree living.

The Interceptor 650 certainly qualifies for that distinction. It was a joy to ride. After one week with it, I was ready to film a Darjeeling Limited of my own.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:47 IST

South Korea is one such country which has succeeded in cutting down the number of coronavirus infections after being one of the worst-hit outside China. Even though on Thursday it reported 114 new cases of coronavirus and six more deaths, the numbers are far lower than the peak of 909 cases reported on February 29, news agency Reuters reported. Health officials say the trend does appear to be slowing in what has been the largest outbreak in Asia outside of China.

South Korea’s trace, track and test approach seems to have been working in its favour, something which the South Indian state of Kerala also seem to have tried recently to contain the rise in coronavirus cases.

On Wednesday, Pathanamthitta district administration released two sets of maps giving a detailed account of three people’s travel after they arrived at the Cochin International Airport on February 29. The chart gives an account of their movement from the airport to their hospitalisation on March 6.

The three travellers flew in from Italy and slipped out of the Cochin International Airport after dodging health authorities. They surfaced after testing positive for the novel coronavirus and are believed to have transmitted the virus to eight of their relatives.

“It was a laborious job. This flowchart helps people who came in contact with them to get tested for possible infection,” said district collector PB Nooh.

The maps were prepared with the help of health officials, the police, locals and relatives of the three people and exhibit a detailed account of all the places they had visited. According to the maps, the three patients had visited banks, hotels, bakeries, a church, hospitals, a bar and had taken public transport.

The South Korean authorities are also reported to have been vigorously tracing down the contacts of all those who tested positive for the virus. The infected individuals would also be traced back to at least 14 days to understand the possible spread of the virus. The process would even include tracking their credit card use, CCTV footage and mobile phone activity, news agency AFP reported.

Kerala continues to be on a coronavirus high alert. The total number of people under observation has crossed 3,000, state Health Minister KK Shailaja said on Wednesday.

“Of the 1,179 samples sent for testing, today 889 samples report came and all were negative and we are waiting for the results of another 213. As on date, we have 14 people who are positive and are under close observation,” said Shailaja yesterday.

The first three positive cases of coronavirus in India were confirmed in Kerala, all of them had recovered successfully.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 73 as on Thursday morning in India. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection."

Highlights Alessia Bonari post shows the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with coronavirus

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds

Her post has gone extremely viral

Coronavirus has become a huge health threat across the world with the number of people affected going up day after day. In the midst of this, an Italian nurse has shared the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with the virus. Alessia Bonari admits in her post that she’s afraid to go to work and feels tired but will continue to do her job. A selfie of herself that she posted shows her face bruised by the mask she has to wear while working.

“I am a nurse and right now I am facing this medical emergency. I’m afraid too, but not going to go shopping, I’m afraid to go to work,” says the post when translated from Italian. She goes on to list some of the things that worry her on a daily basis during her job.

“I’m afraid because the mask may not adhere well to the face, or I may have accidentally touched myself with dirty gloves, or maybe the lenses do not completely cover my eyes and something may have passed,” she says.

“I am physically tired because the protective devices are bad, the lab coat makes me sweat and once dressed I can no longer go to the bathroom or drink for six hours,” she adds.

The whole thing is taking a toll on her psychologically as well and she isn’t alone in feeling this way. But she adds that this will not stop her or her colleagues to do their work.

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds.

She ends her post by appealing to people to be selfless, safe and protect others during these trying times.

“I can’t afford the luxury of going back to my quarantined house, I have to go to work and do my part. You do yours, I ask you please,” she says.

Bonari’s post has collected over 7.3 lakh likes on Instagram and thousands of comments. People are thanking Bonari and other medical professionals like her who are treating those in need.

“You are an example Alessia, we are all with you. You are angels. Good job,” says a comment when translated from Italian. “Thank you very much for all you do,” says another. “Respect for you and all your colleagues,” reads a third.

Coronavirus has caused 827 deaths in Italy. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, Italy has shut down all stores except pharmacies and food shops.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:39 IST

India Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane has defended his team’s batting unit after its horror tour of New Zealand, with the world No 1 side failing to go past even 200 across four innings of the two Tests, which they lost 0-2.

The Virat Kohli-led team had won each of the seven Tests in the ICC World Test Championship before the Test series in New Zealand, but despite the whitewash, India remained atop the points table.

Rahane himself endured a forgettable tour, scoring 91 runs in four innings at 22.75 while batting in challenging conditions. The middle-order batsman, known for his rescue acts overseas, was among the Indian batters who had very few answers against the short ball. “Not really, people are speaking too much about it (short balls),” Rahane said while replying to a query as to what was the reason behind India’s collective failure with the bat.

“If you see the Melbourne innings, we have dominated. As Indian batsmen, we all play short balls well; a one off game doesn’t make you bad players of short ball. As a batsman, what I thought there are two ways—if you are looking to counter attack or go defensive and play that situation. Everyone plays that situation differently, you are going to back yourself as a batsman to play in that situation and if you get out, that is fine. But, as long as you are backing yourself in that situation, that is what matters. Ten out of nine times, you will succeed,” said Rahane, who will be a brand ambassador and an investor in MeraKisan, a part of the Mahindra Group.

“It is important to learn what went wrong (while) playing short balls in New Zealand, but as long as I am on that path to improve, if next time the opposition comes and bowls short balls at me and if I feel like hitting it, I will hit. It is all about accessing the situation and playing accordingly. I do not think we have to make too much fuss about short balls, we have been playing them really well in different formats,” Rahane said.

Rahane added that he was not too concerned about his lack of runs. “See, (in the) last seven games I have been scoring runs... West Indies, South Africa, Bangladesh… it is just a one-off bad game. People will have their own opinions and it is not about what people think about me, it is about what I think about myself and I am not playing cricket for what others are saying. For me it is all about what I think about my game. I respect what people talk; yes, they have their opinion and they get paid for their job and I get paid for what I do,” he said.

One of the reasons for India’ s debacle in New Zealand was playing on wickets that were ideal for swing and seam movement combined with bounce, something that Rahane said is not available even during ‘shadow’ tours.

“I feel it is important to have a shadow tour because you get to know the conditions really well. The only thing I feel is the wickets that we get in shadow games are completely different than what we get in international games. That’s an area but you cannot control that when you go overseas. But I feel if we can get similar conditions that we get in international matches, that will be better (for shadow tours).

“The game that I played for India A in New Zealand, that was a complete flat wicket. We lost (only) three or four wickets in two days, so that’s an area to improve. If we can get similar (Test-like) conditions in shadow tours, that will be really great. When we get practice sessions before the Test matches, we actually simulate those conditions. The practice pitches over there were quite similar but practice and match are a different ball-game,” he said.

The 31-year-old said there was not too much to read into India’s failure. “Test Championship is all about one match and one series at a time—one match at a time because points are involved, because one or two bad games will not make us a bad team. We have done a really good job since last three-four years. Now the Test Championship has started, in this journey, you are going to win and lose some matches; it is all about working towards one goal. Personally, I am not too worried. As a team we are not thinking too much. We learnt a lot from New Zealand series,” he said.

Rahane, who has joined Delhi Capitals from Rajasthan Royals ahead of the upcoming IPL, said he was looking forward to the tournament, “It’s just one series (New Zealand tour). Generally, I have done well for the last seven-eight matches. IPL is a different format; you’ve got to express yourself. It gives an opportunity to play fearless cricket and with freedom.”"

After England skipper Joe Root revealed they won’t be shaking hands with their Sri Lankan counterparts in their upcoming two-match Test series, the England and Wales Cricket Broad (ECB) have gone a step further and asked players to refrain from ‘any unnecessary public engagements’ on the tour. The two teams are scheduled to play two Tests in Sri Lanka — first Test in Galle starting March 19 and second Test in Colombo starting March 27.

The ECB urged players to avoid taking selfies and signing autographs for fans amid coronavirus outbreak which has gripped the entire globe. In their bid to keep the players away from virus, the England board asked players to keep their distance from fan engagements. They also urged the fans to ‘maintain good levels of hygiene’.

“England players and staff have been asked to avoid any unnecessary public engagements, and temporarily avoid casual supporter interaction such as selfies or autographs,” the ECB said in a statement uploaded on its social media handle.

“Whilst we acknowledge that this will be disappointing for some supporters, we stress that this a measure to protect the ongoing wellbeing of the England Test squad and is a decision which has not been taken lightly.

“In addition, England players and staff are also being instructed to avoid shaking hands where a ‘fist pump’ or a personal greeting will suffice. Players will no longer participate in handshakes with each other or the opposition,” the statement added.

Earlier, skipper Joe Root had stated his team will not go for fair play handshakes on their tour of Sri Lanka, amid coronavirus threat. This came in the aftermath of England players being hit by gastroenteritis and flu problems on their tour of South Africa recently.

“After the illnesses that swept through the squad in South Africa, we are well aware of the importance of keeping contact to a minimum and we’ve been given some really sound and sensible advice from our medical team to help prevent spreading germs and bacteria,” Root was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“We are not shaking hands with each other, using instead the well-established fist bump, and we are washing hands regularly and wiping down surfaces using the anti-bacterial wipes and gels we’ve been given in our immunity packs.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 16:12 IST

The ODI between India and South Africa on Thursday may be held in an empty stadium due to the coronavirus scare. Around 58 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported so far in the country and the picturesque stadium could wear an empty look as the two teams fight it out in the first game of the three-match series.

Close to 40 per cent of tickets of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium, some 250 km from the state capital -- with a seating capacity of 22,000 -- remained unsold till Wednesday, match organisers told IANS.

The officials said that in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, cricket buffs, largely foreigners, are trying to take precautionary measures by restricting themselves on travelling and attending public gatherings. Leaving the fear of foreigners aside, even the corporate houses in India preferred to give the stadium a miss.

“Hardly two-three corporate boxes have been sold out this time,” said an HPCA functionary. The stadium, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, has 12 corporate boxes, each having a seating capacity of 20 seats. Each box costs around Rs 2,00,000 per match and they were much in demand in all the previous matches, both international and T20.

On Tuesday, leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had posted a photo of himself with a face mask before heading for the city.

Match organisers also said that a weather alert, which forecast rains, has further discouraged a large section of Indian fans from witnessing the match. Also the match is not happening on a weekend.

In an attempt to stop rain from playing spoilsport, officials offered their prayers at the Indrunag Temple dedicated to the rain god in the hills overlooking the stadium to appease the gods. Cricket fans too participated in the prayers. A special community kitchen was also organised there.

Manmohan Singh, Director of the meteorological office in Shimla, said widespread rains and thundershowers might occur in the region between March 12 and 13 due to fresh western disturbance over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir.

Incidentally, the last international game at the HPCA Stadium between India and South Africa -- a T20I -- was washed out without a ball being bowled in September 2019.

HPCA media-in charge Mohit Sood told IANS in case of rain, the ground would be ready in less than two hours.

“The drainage system is effective to drain out rainwater. Also we have water soaking machines and a light weight plastic cover for covering the entire ground,” he said.

But members of the hospitality industry have more worries from the weather advisory rather than the coronavirus outbreak.

“Seeing the response of the tourists during the Holi weekend, we expect a good arrival during the ODI too,” said Pankaj Chadha, owner of the McLio restaurant in McLeodganj.

But the weather alert might affect the arrival of the tourists, he said.

“We are keeping our fingers crossed. The last match between India and South Africa was washed out. If this happens again, this venue will be considered jinxed for the Proteas,” Chadha added.

For the players, the HPCA is providing accommodation in the Pavilion complex, which has 32 huts made of imported wood. The Pavilion, overlooking the stadium, is some three kilometres from the stadium."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 16:05 IST

The last time South Africa played a bilateral one day international series on Indian soil, they went on to win 3-2. It was the first and only series win for the Proteas in India. Apart from the batsmen from both sides, who made merry on flat tracks, the one bowler who stood out was the young Kagiso Rabada. Rabada and Dale Steyn picked up ten wickets a piece in the series but it was the youngster’s ability to keep a cool head in crunch situations that helped SA trump MS Dhoni’s team.

Five years later, another young South African paceman is looking to make his mark in Indian conditions. Lungi Ngidi played a decisive role in the Test series played between the two countries in early 2018. The youngster troubled Indian batsmen and helped South Africa clinch a closely fought series 2-1. He followed that up with 10 wickets in the ODI series against India but the team didn’t do well. Those performances came in helpful conditions and Ngidi had to prove himself further.

The young speedster was picked up by Chennai Super Kings and he produced the goods for the ‘Yellow Brigade’ in their comeback season in 2018. 11 wickets in 7 matches at a stunning economy of 6 helped Ngidi shine in a team full of seasoned superstars as CSK strolled their way to the title. The youngster though has struggled with injuries, which led to him to miss IPL 2019.

ALSO READ: Virat Kohli on verge of joining Sachin Tendulkar in ODI elite list

Ngidi though has made a good comeback and that has come at a time when South African cricket is going through a phase of transition. A poor outing at the 2019 ICC World Cup meant heads rolled and a new management is looking to take the team back to its glory days. The Proteas recently completed a 3-0 whitewash over Australia at home and Ngidi was at the centre of that success. With 27 wickets in 14 matches, Ngidi is South Africa’s most successful bowler in ODIs since 2019. His performance this year has been prolific, picking up 12 wickets in 4 matches.

The bounce he generates is disconcerting for batsmen and with the Indians still reeling from the impact of twin whitewashes in New Zealand, Ngidi could pose a potent threat. A look at the head to head records and Indian captain Virat Kohli holds an edge over the paceman in 50-over format. Ngidi though has dismissed the likes of Shikhar Dhawan in the past and definitely has the number of Shreyas Iyer.

For India though the man in form is KL Rahul and the duel between these two could well decide which way the series will go."

India will take on South Africa in a 3-match ODI series and this gives the side a great chance to come back to winning ways after having tasted 5 defeats in a trot in New Zealand. The team have been brilliant in their own conditions and hence, they should be the favourites. South Africa, on the other hand, have blanked Australia 3-0 in the just-concluded ODI series and should be a side brimming with confidence.

Our aim is to win the series because if we don’t do well, an individual’s confidence also gets affected,” Bhuvneshwar said on the eve of the first ODI between India and South Africa here on Thursday.

South Africa captain Quinton de Kock expects urged the senior members of his team to own up responsibility as well as guide the youngsters during the three-match ODI series against India starting here on Thursday. De Kock said former captain Faf du Plessis’ comeback after being rested for the Australia series, will hold the visitors in a good stead in the upcoming ODIs.

“Obviously, Faf (du Plessis) has comeback. He plays a big role for us from the leadership point of view. He is here to help out the younger guys in the team. He adds a lot of value for us. He also knows he has lot of value to give to this team. His experience will be a big help for us in this series,” De Kock said on the eve of the first ODI here on Wednesday.

“We understand that we are coming here with quite an inexperienced side in these conditions but it’s important Faf, me, David Miller to help out these guys around, lead the way. Pass on our knowledge to the youngsters.” Du Plessis was rested for the ODI series against South Africa at home which the Proteas won 3-0.

“He (Du Plessis) was given a chance to have a break. It’s been a long season so I think it was important to let him put his feet up for a while, just re-organise his thoughts.” There is no substitute of experience and the Proteas skipper is glad to get his senior-most pro back in the side.

“Just glad to have him back with us. We are undecided where he is going to bat at the moment but we will come up with the decision later,” de Kock said.

The Proteas skipper said the visitors are brimming with confidence coming into the tour after drubbing Australia back home.

“India is an unbelievable team, They have got great balance, but I am sure we are also coming here with a lot of confidence,” De Kock said.

De Kock said left-arm seamer Beuren Hendricks has recovered from his illness and is available for selection but batsman Temba Bavuma is uncertain as he is yet to fully recover from the hamstring injury.

“Beuran was unfortunately ill back in South Africa but he is back up for selection. Temba we will find out today but I don’t think he will be ready, I am not sure,” he said."

South Africa are back in India, this time for the ODI series and after having mixed results in the T20I and Test series, the side would look to stamp their authority in the upcoming series. They are coming on the back of a superb series win against Australia at home and would look to continue their impressive performance against India. The hosts, on the other hand, were blanked in the ODI series in New Zealand and hence, now have their task cut out to find the winning combination and get back to winning ways.

For starters, they need to figure out the perfect combination for the 1st ODI in Dharamsala and there are a number of spots which would need deliberation.

Who will be the openers?

Shikhar Dhawan is back in the mix and hence, he should be one of the openers. However, who will accompany him at the top of the order will be the big conundrum facing the management, Prithvi Shaw looked good but did not manage any big score against New Zealand and hence, this could prompt the management to give Shubman Gill the nod.

The pace attack

Bhuvneshwar Kumar is back in the mix, but so is Hardik Pandya. This will give the management plenty to think ahead of the 1st ODI. Hardik Pandya’s workload will be under the scanner and whether or not, he completes his quota remains to be seen. Navdeep Saini and Jasprit Bumrah should be the other pacers in the squad and depending on how confident Kohli is about Hardik’s role as a seam bowler, he could make a decision about Bhuvneshwar.

The spinners?

Dharamsala has not been too kind to the spinners and in the recent past, India have played with either Kuldeep Yadav or Yuzvendra Chahal as the sole wrist spinner. Which way will Kohli look in the first ODI remains to be seen. Kuldeep’s wicket-taking abilities have faded away and this should give Kohli the confidence to include Yuzvendra Chahal in the mix. There is Ravindra Jadeja who will be another key element of this bowling attack and hence, Kohli could opt for the leggie."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 15:07 IST

Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq believes former opener Saeed Anwar is the best ODI player the country has ever produced. Hailing his hard-hitting abilities, Inzamam stated Anwar used to play shots which others could only dream of and that made him one of the best players in white-ball cricket.

Anwar featured in 247 ODIs for Pakistan and scored 8824 runs. He also slammed 20 centuries and 43 half-centuries during the course of his illustrious career. Also, Anwar’s 194 against India in Chennai 1997 was the highest individual score by a batsman in ODIs for a very long time.

“Saeed Anwar’s batting was such that we wished to play like him,” Inzamam said in a YouTube video as quoted by PakPassion. “The shots that we’d dream of at night, he would play them in the morning.”

“Out of all the Pakistani batsmen, people say I had a lot of talent and I didn’t perform according to my talent, but I believe that the talent that Saeed Anwar had, no one else had.

“When he was batting, it looked like cricket was very easy. The ball didn’t seem to be seaming or swinging. When I batted alongside him, I enjoyed it a lot. He would put the bowler under pressure, making it easier for the others,” he added.

“I don’t think there has ever been a similar wristy player in Pakistan. I think Saeed Anwar is the best ODI player that Pakistan has ever produced. When you create an ODI XI, he will easily fit it. He started hard hitting in Pakistan.”

Despite such high praise for his former teammate, Inzamam remains the top-spot holder in the list of most runs scored by a Pakistan cricketer in ODIs. He takes the numero uno spot with 11739 runs and is also the only batsman from his nation to score in excess of 10000 runs in ODIs.

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 14:45 IST

Workload management is back in focus ahead of the IPL, in another World Cup year, and the BCCI plans to take extra care of injury-prone players like Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya.

Skipper Virat Kohli had put in a lot of emphasis on workload management before the IPL last year but most players, who were in contention for a place in the 2019 World Cup squad, ended up playing all games for their respective franchisees.

It has been learnt that the national selectors will sit down during the Irani Cup, which will be held right after the Ranji Trophy final and take a call after checking the workload and medical database of all centrally contracted players.

“We will communicate our concerns to the respective IPL teams on workload management of the players. We are more concerned about players who are coming fresh from injuries – Shikhar, Bhuvneshwar, Hardik, even Ishant (who is not part of limited overs set-up),” a BCCI official told PTI on Wednesday.

Part of standard practice, India players will be given hand-outs from the national team physio before they join their respective IPL teams, stating the dos and don’ts.

While the 50-over World Cup happened right after the 2019 IPL, the T20 World Cup will take place in October-November but there are a number of bilateral series lined up before the global event.

“Though we will monitor the workload of our players closely but we can’t force things down on the IPL teams after a point. They want their best players to play, so the onus here lies on the player more than anybody else to avoid burn out,” the official added.

Pandya, who was out of action for more than six months having undergone a back surgery, is set to play his first international game on Thursday since September.

Bhuvneshwar too was out of action for long after he had to get his sports hernia operated. He too is in the India ODI squad for the South Africa series.

Dhawan too is back having endured multiple injuries over the past 12 months. There have been question raised over poor handling of Ishant Sharma’s ankle injury which recurred during the Test series in New Zealand."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 14:29 IST

Former India spinner Dilip Doshi on Wednesday slammed BCCI’s decision to use a restricted DRS for the Ranji Trophy final, saying the technology should be deployed “fully or not at all”.

Ball tracking technology, which is a major component of the DRS, is not being used by the BCCI for the Ranji Trophy. The board introduced the limited version of DRS from the semifinals with an aim to reduce the number of umpiring howlers.

Live score Saurashtra vs Bengal, Ranji Trophy final

“If you use a technology like DRS, it should be used properly and fully. Because using a percentage of it doesn’t make sense,” Doshi told PTI while watching the proceedings on day three of the final between Bengal and Saurashtra.

The third umpire has spin vision, split screen, stump mic and the zoomer at his disposal. Leading domestic players including Abhimanyu Mithun have already asked for ball tracking for next season.

At the stroke of lunch on day three, Bengal captain Abhimanyu Easwaran was adjudged LBW by the on-field umpire and he went for the DRS. As the third umpire did not have the ball tracking available, he could not overrule the on-field umpire’s decision though the ball seemed going down the leg side.

Asked about the dismissal, Doshi said: “It looked it was going down leg but the ball was not tracked. You left a doubt in the minds of people. At this level, there should be no doubt.

“As far as reducing the number of howlers are concerned, there is a fine line between howlers and non-howlers.” The 72-year-old played 33 Tests and 13 ODIs for India, taking 114 and 22 wickets respectively."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 14:37 IST

Since making his debut in the 50-over format in 2016, Jasprit Bumrah has had a meteoric rise and has become the leader of India’s pace attack. His unmatched accuracy, ability to keep a lid on runs coupled with wicket taking abilities, make him an asset for captain Virat Kohli. The extent of Bumrah’s outstanding start to his ODI career can be gauged from the fact that he is the second fastest Indian to the 100-wicket mark, missing Mohammed Shami’s mark by just one match.

His performances on flat Indian tracks have also been a highlight of his short career so far. But ever since his return from injury, sustained after India’s tour of West Indies last year, the paceman has not been at his best. In the six ODIs he has played this year, Bumrah has managed to pick only 1 wicket and averages a rather unbelievable 287. The three-match India vs South Africa series thus provides a perfect platform for the paceman to return to form.

Bumrah played 3 ODIs against Australia at home in January, and picked up only 1 wicket in the entire series, which India managed to win 2-1. But the real shocker came in New Zealand as he failed to pick up a single wicket in the three matches, and also went for runs. The direct impact was seen in the result as India were whitewashed in an ODI series after 31 long years.

The paceman though holds a good record against South Africa and that is where Indian fans can hope for a revival. He has picked up 12 wickets in 8 matches against the Proteas, but the impressive part lies in the economy. Bumrah has conceded only 3.83 runs per over against South Africa. That shows how difficult it is to get him away.

The Indian team is reeling from the impact of the twin whitewashes, in ODIs and Tests, in New Zealand and needs a good series against South Africa to get back to wining ways. Bumrah and Virat Kohli will be the two players the team will look at to get them out of this hole and both are ready for the challenge."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 14:34 IST

India seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar hinted that they might limit the usage of saliva to shine the white ball during the first ODI against South Africa in Dharamsala on Thursday as a precautionary measure in the wake of the deadly Novel Coronavirus outbreak.

Bhuvneshwar, however, said a decision on this will be taken by the team doctor during a meeting later on Wednesday.

“We have thought about this thing (not using saliva) but I can’t say right now we will not use saliva because if we don’t use saliva then how will we shine the ball. Then we will get hit and you people will say you are not bowling well,” the 31-year-old pacer, who is returning to the team after recovering from sports hernia surgery, said during the post-match press conference here.

“But it’s a valid point and let’s see we will have a team meeting today and whatever instruction we get or whatever is the best option we will do. It all depends on the team doctor and what advise he gives us,” he added.

Amid the ever-rising danger of the Coronavirus outbreak with more than 40 positive cases in the country, Bhuvneshwar said they are taking every possible precaution in these difficult times.

He, however, refused to speculate on whether the upcoming Indian Premier League will be disrupted by the deadly disease.

“You cannot say anything right now because it’s taking a dangerous situation in India. But we are taking every precaution we can take. We have a team doctor with us and he is giving us instructions about dos and don’ts. So we hope it won’t go (spread) much further,” he said.

Just like other teams, Indian players have also been advised to stay away from fans.

“Few dos and don’ts which the team doctor wants us to do. Simple things like maintaining hygiene, keep washing your hands regularly and not going closer to fans and all those things.

“But we cannot avoid fans because they love us, they support us. In the meantime, we can try and not get too much closer to them. We can avoid as much as we can,” he added.

South Africa coach Mark Boucher had said that the Proteas could avoid the customary handshakes during their stay in India in the wake of the outbreak.

Despite the Covid19 wreaking havoc worldwide, South Africa went ahead with the tour only after their medical and security team gave a go-ahead after doing a risk assessment.

India vs South Africa 1st ODI predictions: India going into a series on the back of 5 losses (3 ODIs and 2 Tests) on the trot is rare, considering the recent laurels of the Virat Kohli-led side. But as coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli have time and again said (and delivered more often than not too), it shouldn’t play on the back of their minds when India take on South Africa in the three-match ODI series starting with the first ODI at the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala on Thursday.

Apart from the strong mindset of the team, what would go in India’s favour is their return to familiar conditions and the return of first XI players like Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The trio has been in and out of the Indian side because of injury concerns but all three of them proved their fitness in the DY Patil T20 cup to earn their spots back in the side.

Here’s India’s Predicted XI for India vs South Africa 1st ODI at Dharamsala

Shikhar Dhawan

In the absence of Rohit Sharma, who is yet to recover from a calf injury, Shikhar Dhawan’s return would lend valuable experience to the Indian top-order, which badly missed both the openers in New Zealand. Dhawan had dislocated his shoulder during the final ODI against Australia at home and missed the New Zealand series.

Prithvi Shaw

It is tempting to open with KL Rahul but considering India’s stance of making Rahul keep wickets and bat him in the middle order, it looks unlikely. That once again opens the door for Prithvi Shaw who sizzled, sparkled but failed to make it big in New Zealand. The young Mumbai opener would look to grab the opportunity with both hands on Wednesday against South Africa.

Virat Kohli

Virat Kohli managed just 75 runs against the Kiwis in ODIs and his series aggregate was the lowest in his career. The Indian skipper would be itching to silence his critics, who have raised eyebrows after his statement on ODIs not having context in the current calendar when India face South Africa in the first ODI at Dharamsala.

Shreyas Iyer

Of late, No.4 hasn’t remained the hot topic when it comes to the Indian batting, thanks to Shreyas Iyer. The young right-hander has made that spot his own. With scores of 103, 52 and 62, he was India’s highest run-scorer in the three ODIs against New Zealand and will look to continue the good work in the first ODI against South Africa.

KL Rahul

The Man of the series of the five-match T20I series in New Zealand, KL Rahul also scored a century in the 3rd ODI at Mount Maunganui. With India going ahead with him as the preferred keeper over Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul’s position in the Indian side becomes ever so crucial.

Manish Pandey

Manish Pandey might just get a longer run at No 6 now that Kedar Jadhav has finally been dropped from the squad. Pandey just got one opportunity in the ODIs against New Zealand but was decent in the T20Is. He would look to play the role of a finisher in the three-match ODI series against South Africa starting on Wednesday.

Hardik Pandya

All eyes will be on Hardik Pandya in the India vs South Africa 1st ODI at Dharamsala. The all-rounder is returning to international cricket after a gap of almost six months. Pandya last played an ODI against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final in Manchester and his last international game was a T20 against the Proteas in Bengaluru in September last year. He forced his way back into the national team with his all-round performances at the DY Patil Corporate Cup, where he looked completely fit and ready to go. Pandya looked in great touch in the practice session on Monday.

Ravindra Jadeja

With rain in sight and the Dharamsala pitch-factor in mind, India might just go in with one spinner in the first ODI at and that in all probability will be Ravindra Jadeja. Keeping Jadeja’s all-round abilities in mind, it is very hard to keep him away from the playing XI despite Pandya’s return.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar

Recently, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been in the news more for his injuries, its reoccurrences than his bowling. One of India’s main weapons in limited-overs cricket, Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s absence hurt India in the three-match ODI series against New Zealand. The right-arm seamer proved his fitness in the DY Patil T20 Cup and will be keen to lead India’s attack with Jasprit Bumrah.

Navdeep Saini

Saini was wicketless in the two ODIs he played in New Zealand but was mighty impressive with the ball. His ability to extract extra bounce from the track and also bowl at the death with equal effectiveness makes him one of the front runners to grab that third seamers spot in the first ODI against South Africa.

Jasprit Bumrah

Jasprit Bumrah went wicketless in the ODIs against New Zealand, making it the first instance of him not picking up a wicket in any series. India’s spearhead coped a lot of criticism for not being able to pick up wickets after coming from his injury. He will be eager to prove his critics wrong in the South Africa series."

Former South Africa all-rounder Albie Morkel believes it is going to be a tough series for Proteas when they take on India in the upcoming three-match ODI series starting Thursday. The two teams are scheduled to play matches in Dharamsala, Lucknow and Kolkata respectively and Morkel feels South African players will have their work cut out as beating India in India almost an impossible task.

The Proteas are coming into the series on back of a resounding 3-0 whitewash of Australia in ODIs, however, Morkel still remains unsure of their chances against Virat Kohli and his troops.

“It was sort of a mixed summer before the new coaching staff took over,” Morkel was quoted as saying by Sportstar. “Obviously, they had a fantastic win against Australia in the ODI series, after losing the T20 series badly. So, I’m unsure.”

“Even if a team is in top form, beating India in India is almost an impossible task. It’s going be a tough series for them, but I do expect them to at least compete. India will win it 2-1, but South Africa should compete, especially now that they have the confidence after the series against Australia,” he added.

Virat Kohli has not been enjoying a good run of form lately but when the Indian cricket team skipper takes the field against South Africa in the first ODI encounter in Dharamsala, he will be on the verge of claiming a major milestone in ODI cricket. Kohli is currently 133 runs away from completing 12000 runs in ODIs - a feat achieved by five other cricketers including India legend Sachin Tendulkar. The right-hander will become only the second India batsman to achieve this feat and he will also be the fastest as every other batsman has taken more than 300 innings to achieve this feat. Kohli, on the other hand, has played just 239 innings so far.

Kohli managed just 75 runs against New Zealand, and going by his standards the India skipper would be itching to silence his critics, who have raised eyebrows after his statement on ODIs not having context in the current calendar.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Also Watch | Coronavirus: What we know and what we don’t

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 11:47 IST

Arun Lal’s “very poor pitch” comment on the opening day drew a sharp rebuttal from Saurashtra Cricket Association on Wednesday when its curator Mahendra Rajdev said the Bengal coach erred in his judgement by jumping the gun in the Ranji Trophy final here.

Saurashtra, who reached 206 for five on day one, went on to post a formidable 425 on day three. The pitch is certainly a tricky one with the ball keeping low frequently but Cheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada showed remarkable application with a five-hour stand on day two.

“The pitch may not have had extra bounce which Bengal bowlers were looking for, but that does not make the wicket poor,” said Rajdev in an SCA statement.

“It is a rather hasty and poor judgment by the Bengal Coach and it may not be beneficial for their own players when the coach makes a statement like this.

“It is the same pitch for both the teams, which was prepared under the neutral curator (L Prashanth Rao) from the BCCI,” he added.

Lal, in fact, had maintained his stance on the pitch after day two saying it was a dead pitch which can’t be good for cricket.

An SCA official told PTI there are no plans of making a formal complaint to the BCCI over Lal’s tirade. The match referee will be submitting its report to the BCCI which is standard practice.

“It was way too early for Lal to talk the way he did. It is a decent wicket. The match had hardly begun and he spoke like this. He should have been more careful with his words,” the official said."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 11:22 IST

The 2021 Women’s World Cup, set to be played in New Zealand, will have a reserve day for all three knockout games, each for the semi-finals and the final.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) had faced a lot of criticism last week after one of the semi-finals of the Women’s T20 World Cup between India and England was washed out. India had progressed to the final on account of their unbeaten run in the group stage.

On Wednesday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) released the 31-match schedule for the tournament where the games will be held at six venues.

Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin will host the games in the tournament. The two semi-finals will be played at Tauranga and Hamilton on March 3 and March 4 respectively while the final will be held on March 7 under lights at the Hagley Oval.

Hosts New Zealand will kickoff the tournament with a clash against a qualifier on at Eden Park, Auckland on February 6, 2021.

Only four teams have been confirmed for the World Cup so far. Australia, defending champions England, South Africa and hosts New Zealand have already qualified with four more spots are up for grabs. The remaining teams will be confirmed following the conclusion of the Women’s Championship and the qualifying event in Sri Lanka in July.

Among the matches confirmed for now, the Trans-Tasman clash featuring Australia and New Zealand on February 13 and the clash between defending champions England and Australia on the second day of the tournament stand out.

“It’s a match we absolutely fizz about as players - taking on the Aussies is always a huge thrill. Cricket fans who come along to the Basin Reserve on Saturday the 13th of February will no doubt see a lot of passion from both teams,” said New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine.

“Playing in a World Cup against our arch-rivals in my home city will be an unreal feeling,” she added.

Prize money for the showpiece of women’s international cricket will total NZD$5.5million, and all matches will be broadcast live.

ICC CEO, Manu Sawhney said: “The ICC has made a long-term commitment to to elevating women’s cricket as part of our strategy to grow and develop the global game.

“We are extremely proud of the significant progress we have made in increasing prize money for ICC events over the last few years, with the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand having $NZD5.5 million dollars available in prize money compared to $NZD3.1m in 2017 and $NZD316,000 in 2013.”

ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup CEO Andrea Nelson said: “Our team is proud to be delivering a tournament where Kiwis across the whole country, in each of our six host cities, can really get involved in what is a truly special event.”

“We can’t wait to see the excitement build around New Zealand as we prepare to roll out the welcome mat for the rest of the world,” she added.

Hamilton will play host to seven games in the tournament, which is the most, including the semifinal. Christchurch, Wellington and Tauranga will host six games each. Auckland and Dunedin will host two and four matches respectively."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 11:10 IST

India legends took on Sri Lanka legends in their second game of the Road Safety World Series on Tuesday and the toss was expected to play a major role due to the ‘dew factor’. India legends skipper Sachin Tendulkar won the toss and decided to field first in order to take advantage of the conditions. While the decision turned out to be right as India legends raced to a five-wicket win, teammate Virender Sehwag had a hilarious reaction to the skipper’s decision. “We are getting sore while fielding and Sachin elected to bowl first and makes us field 20 overs, tires us before batting,” stated the former swashbuckling Indian opener, who hilariously complained about Tendulkar,” Sehwag said while talking to the official broadcasters.

Irfan Pathan took the important wicket of Romesh Kaluwitharana and while chasing, he slammed 57 off just 31 deliveries as his team clinched the encounter by five wickets.

It was a great show by Pathan as he dominated proceedings after the Sri Lanka bowling attack and his innings comprised on six boundaries and three massive sixes.

Pathan took a special liking to Farveez Maharoof as he slammed the medium pacer for two sixes and a boundary while a boundary and a six off Tillakaratne Dilshan was enough to finish the game for India legends.

The Indian Legends had a difficult start to their chase as they lost openers Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and two-drop Yuvraj Singh with just 19 runs on the scoreboard.

Pathan, along with Manpreet Singh Gony, changed the course of the game hitting 26 runs in the 16th over bowled by Farveez Mahroof before finishing the match in Tillakratne Dilshan’s over.

Earlier, Munaf Patel showed why he was a vital cog in the Indian team line-up during his international playing days. His accuracy with seam movements once again reaped major dividends when he scalped four for 19 for India Legends to restrict Sri Lanka Legends for 138 for the loss of eight wickets in 20 overs.

Saurashtra vs Bengal Day 3 highlights -

17:01 hrs: STUMPS on Day 3! Bengal 134 for 3, trail Saurashtra by 291 runs.

16:54 hrs: Chatterjee survives! Numerous replays, a good 4-5 minute wait and finally the third umpire decided to overturn the decision. You cannot really blame the umpire here, it was mighty close and without a snickometre it was never going to be easy. On naked eye however, it looked as if there was an inside edge and he went with that. Sudip Chatterjee lives to fight another day (literally)

16:35 hrs: Unadkat returns! This might be Saurashtra’s last throw of the dice to get a wicket before close of play on Day 3. No prizes for guessing that Bengal is playing for stumps and that might just allow to Unadkat to attack more.

16:15 hrs: FOUR! Saha gets off the mark with stunning cover drive off Chirag Jani. A gentle loosener from Jani, he intended to swing the ball by pitching it further up but when it doesn't swing it becomes easy pickings for the batsman.

15:59 hrs: OUT! LBW. Manoj Tiwary has been dismissed by Chirag Jani. He was the who overstepped and did not get the wicket of Tiwary but he has more than made up for it by getting his man with another brilliant in-dipper. Tiwary was rooted to the crease and it struck him right front, the umpire had no hesitation in rasing his finger. Tiwary thought about taking the DRS but then decided against it.

15:45 hrs: FOUR! Consecutive fours! This time even better. A fuller length delivery from Sakariya, Chatterjee presents the full face of the bat and drives it straight down the ground for a boundary.

15:44 hrs: FOUR! A loose delivery on the pads from Sakariya and Chatterjee takes full advantage of it. The best thing he did was to find the gap despite there being three fielders on the leg side.

15:28 hrs: Unadkat bowling cross seam! After not finding much assistance from the track, Unadkat has decided to bowl cross seam. He is renowned for his variations and cutters in the shorer format of the game, it will be interesting to see how he uses those with the red ball.

15:14 hrs: Jaydev Unadkat hasn’t picked up a wicket yet but he hasn’t gone for runs either. In 10 overs, he has given just 29 runs and he will eager to open his account in the final session of the day.

15:00 hrs: Final session of the day! Manoj Tiwary and Sudip Chatterjee will look to bat for most parts of the day as Bengal will he hopeful to put on runs in the post-tea session. As for Saurashtra, they know they can rattle Bengal by picking up couple of wickets in this session.

14:45 hrs: Tea! Manoj Tiwary and Sudip Chatterjee kept the bowlers at bay with their 59-run unbeaten stand. Bengal are still 331 runs behind but Tiwari and Chatterjee ensured they didn’t suffer any more hiccups in the second session after the dismissal of openers.

14:30 hrs: The experienced pair of Sudip Chatterjee and Manoj Tiwary have weathered the storm after two quick wickets to stable the Bengal innings. Bengal haven’t scored at great clip but they know this is the pair if they have to take the first innings lead.

14:14 hrs: FOUR! Depth touch from Sudip Chatterjee. It wasn’t that short but he used the depth of his crease to dab it throught he vacant third man region for a boundary.

14:06 hrs: Manoj Tiwary survives! The Bengal camp was distraught, Chirga Jani was over the moon but it all changed as the umpire went upstairs to check for the no ball. And as it turned out, Jani’s front foot had landed on the line, which belongs to the umpire. It was declared a no ball. That one had kept low, Tiwary was rooted to his crease and had chopped it back on to his stumps.

13:45 hrs: Good tussle between Tiwary and Jadeja! Manoj Tiwary, like always, is trying to get on top of the spinner by dancing down the track and upset his rhythm but the left-arm spinner Jadeja has been spot on so far. This battle is very important as far as this Bengal innings is concerned.

13:26 hrs: FOUR! That was there to be hit, short and wide from Jadeja and Chatterjee wasn’t going to miss out on that opportunity. He rocked back and cut it past point to collect his first boundary.

13:17 hrs: A huge appeal from the Saurashtra players but umpire Padmanabhan is unmoved. Did it come off the pad? Looks like it did. Chatterjee goes for the sweep again, had to fetch it from outside off and Jadeja got a bit of turn and bounce. It seems to have missed the bat.

13:13 hrs: FOUR! Fifty up for Bengal! That was trademark Manoj Tiwary. A short and wide delivery from Unadkat, Tiwary stands and goes at it with all hands and minimal feet movement and dabs it throught the vacant point area for a boundary.

12:58 hrs: Maiden from Prerak! The right-arm medium pacer looks innocuous but has the ability to surprise the batsmen with his banana swing. Sudip Chatterjee knows this and he was extra cautious in that over.

12:45 hrs: Day 3, session 2! Dharmendrasinh Jadeja will be up against Sudip Chatterjee in the first over after lunch.

12:10 hrs: LUNCH AT DAY 3! Those two wickets just at the stroke of lunch have given Saurashtra complete control of the Ranji Trophy final. Another session that the hosts would know went their way. After getting to 425 thanks to an important 38-run last wicket stand, Saurashtra have removed both the Bengal openers with 390 runs still to play with. Bengal 35 for 2.

12:03 hrs: OUT! Prerak has dismissed Abhimanyu Easwaran for 9. Prerak gets the ball to jag back in, Easwaran plays all around it and the umpire raises his finger. That looked to be going down, Easwaran has chat with his partner and decides to opt for the review. The impact seems to be in front of leg-stump but it appears that the ball might slide down the leg side, it struck him high on the knhee-roll too. Unfortunately for Easwaran and Bengal, there is no ball-tracking here and the third umpire decides to stay with the on field decision. Big wicket of Saurashtra.

11:57 hrs: OUT! Dharmendrasinh Jadeja has broken the promising Bengal opening stand. A flighted delivery, Gharami pushed at it with hard hands and it just got the inside edge of his bat. A very good catch at forward short leg by Viswaraj. Gharami was looking good but he has to go for 25.

11:48 hrs: FOUR! What an effortless shot that was from Gharami. Where was he all this while? Gharami has been brilliant against pacers and now he shows his class against spin too. A flighted delivery from Jadeja, Gharami plants his front foot forward and just strokes it through mid on.

11:35 hrs: The deficit under 400 for Bengal! What happened there? Easwaran thought the ball would bounce more the it came straight to him from a length and he had nowhere to go. He fend it awkwardly but fortunately for him, the ball landed in man’s land and Bengal got a single, which brought the target down under 400.

11:30 hrs: Gharami looking good! The debutant looks confident. The flick and the straight drive he hit off Unadkat gave clear indications that he has the potential.

11:22 hrs: FOUR! Brilliant from the debutant. Unadkat strays down the leg side and Gharami was up to the mark. He just flicks it past the square leg fielder to collect his first boundary in the first-class cricket.

11:15 hrs:Solid from Bengal openers! Abhimanyu Easwaran and SK Gharami have done a good job against the Saurashtra new ball bowlers. The odd ball from Unadkat has caused some troubles to Easwaran but by and large the Bengal right-handers have been confident.

10:55 hrs: Unadkat starts well. Two deliveries had the shape in to the right-hander in Unadkat’s first over that would encourage the Saurashtra captain. The Bengal openers Abhimanyu Easwaran and debutant SK Gharami will have their task cut out.

10:37 hrs:BOWLED! Shahbaz gets Unadkat for 20. Bengal have bowled out Saurashtra for 425. This has to be a very good first innings score in a final. The foundation was laid by a brilliant century from Arpit Vasavda and a patient 66 from Cheteshwar Pujara. For Bengal, right-arm seamer Akash Deep was the star with 4/98.

10:30 hrs: FOUR! That was crunched by Jadeja. Short and wide from Mukesh and the left-hander gave the full monty. This partnership is turning out to be a brilliant one for Saurashtra and dare we say, these runs might come out to haunt Bengal in the end. The partnership between Unadakat and Jadeja is now 34.

10:02 hrs: 400 up for Saurashtra and this is a brilliant show from their batsmen. Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Jaydev Unadkat are playing an important part in this innings and this is looking quite tough for Bengal.

09:46 hrs: Akash Deep strikes for Bengal and Chirag Jani will have to return to the pavillion. The uneven bounce continues to bother the batsmen as the ball did not rise at all and Jani was castled.

09:20 hrs: Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the Ranji Trophy final between Bengal and Saurashtra. It has been a good outing for Saurashtra till now with Arpit Vasavada and Cheteshwar Pujara putting them in the driver’s seat. Will Bengal be able to match them with the bat? Only time will tell."

Irfan Pathan was the star performer for India Legends as they cruised to victory over Sri Lanka legends in their second game in the ongoing Road Safety World Series on Tuesday. The former India all-rounder took the important wicket of Romesh Kaluwitharana and while chasing, he slammed 57 off just 31 deliveries as his team clinched the encounter by five wickets. It was a great show by Pathan as he dominated proceedings after the Sri Lanka bowling attack and his innings comprised on six boundaries and three massive sixes.

Pathan took a special liking to Farveez Maharoof as he slammed the medium pacer for two sixes and a boundary while a boundary and a six off Tillakaratne Dilshan was enough to finish the game for India legends.

Chasing 139, India Legends got off to the worst possible start as the side lost Sachin Tendulkar (0) in the very first over of the innings. Soon after, Virender Sehwag (3) and Yuvraj Singh (1) were sent back to the pavilion, reducing India to 19/3 in the fifth over.

Mohammad Kaif and Sanjay Bangar then retrieved the innings for the Indian side as the duo put on 43 runs for the fourth wicket, but their feat came to an end in the 11th over as Rangana Herath dismissed Bangar (18).

With 58 runs required from 34 balls, Kaif (46) also gave away his wicket, in trying to look for boundaries, and with his dismissal, India was staring down the barrel. However, in the final overs, Irfan Pathan changed the momentum of the innings as he kept on scoring boundaries and went on to find support in Manpreet Gony.

Pathan and Gony went on to put up a partnership of 58 runs, taking India to a victory by five wickets and with eight balls to spare. Earlier, Munaf Patel’s four-wicket haul helped India Legends restrict Sri Lanka Legends to 138/8 in the allotted twenty overs.

Arpit Vasavada, who struck a crucial hundred in the Ranji Trophy final in company of childhood friend Cheteshwar Pujara on Tuesday, says he was determined to bat time with the Indian batting mainstay, a plan that worked out very well for Saurashtra.

Both Vasavada (106 off 287) and Pujara (66 off 237) batted for five hours on day two for their 142-run stand off 380 balls, succeeding in their plan to wear down the Bengal attack.

Pujara overcame illness to make a valuable contribution while Vasavada, who is coached by the former’s father Arvind, could not have asked for a bigger stage to score a back-to-back hundred. “We have been playing together since long. It was in my mind that because of Pujara’s health, he will bat after me and I knew he would be there (in the middle). So, for me it was about not getting tired and keep playing with him,” said Vasavada.

Pujara and Vasavada put Saurashtra in a strong position, taking their side to 384 for eight at close of play on a deteriorating surface.

Pujara has mastered the art of batting long and Vasavada said batting alongside him helped him immensely. The focus was on defending in their marathon stand. “We batted well. It is not an easy wicket. We have got runs on the board so we have an upper hand.” Asked if there was a specific plan to tire out Bengal’s pace attack, the left-handed Vasavada said: “We just wanted to bat as long as possible to tire them out.” The 31-year-old is having his best first-class season with four hundreds.

“It was about staying on the wicket. I have learnt from Pujara’s father. Even Cheteshwar was telling me in the middle, what to do, what not to do. I get a lot confidence when he is at the other end.”

Bengal coach Arun Lal, who rated the pitch as “very poor” on day one, maintained his stance despite Saurashtra putting up a strong first innings total.

Asked if he spoke too early about the surface, Lal said: “No. it is a poor wicket, it’s not a cricketing wicket. It is slow and low. They batted off course but in cricket there is bowling, fielding, spin and pace. It’s not only batting. “And batting 170 runs (178 actually) in the whole day. They also could not score with the ball keeping so low.” He said he was proud of his bowlers as they stuck to their task.

“We are not out of the game yet. The match is open. The only thing is, they have runs on the board and we have not. If we have a good start, we can get these runs,” Lal said. “I would have been happier if we restricted them to 300-325 but they played well. In morning session, they (Pujara and Vasavada) did not take any chances. They taught us how to play on this wicket. To bowl on a dead pitch requires a lot of effort. We were able to contain them. I am reasonably happy.”"

India Legends took on Sri Lanka Legends in their second match of the Road Safety World Series in Mumbai. Sachin Tendulkar won the toss and elected to field first as he expected dew factor to come in which would help his side chase down the total. The bowlers vindicated the decision of the skipper as they kept a tight leash on the Sri Lankan openers - Tillakaratne Dilshan and Romesh Kaluwitharana, After having seen off the powerplay overs, both the openers decided to open the shoulders but this did not yield dividends for Sri Lanka.

Dilshan, who was looking ominous, decided to open his shoulders and he went after Munaf Patel. However, he did not get the timing right as he looked to pull a short ball away and as a result, the ball went miles up in the air. Mohammed Kaif ran in from deep square leg, leapt forward and took an acrobatic catch to the Sri Lankan legends captain back to the pavilion.

Umpire C Shamsuddin has been ruled out of the ongoing Ranji Trophy final between Saurashtra and Bengal because of swelling in his lower abdomen. This happened when a ball thrown by a Bengal fielder following the fall of a wicket on Monday hit Shamsuddin when he was looking elsewhere.

Following this, KN Ananthapadhmanabhan, the other on-field umpire, officiated from both ends for one full session. Local umpire Piyush Kakkar stood at square leg. As per the BCCI regulations, a neutral umpire should be present from both ends and since, Kakkar was from Rajkot he was not allowed officiate from the main end.

“He didn’t look comfortable taking the field because of pain, so we took him to the hospital and he underwent a medical examination. He was advised a week’s rest, so he will return home,” ESPN Cricinfo quoted a Saurashtra Cricket Association official as saying.

After a rather frenetic day, the BCCI summoned Yashwant Barde from Mumbai as a replacement. He will now accompany Ananthapadhmanabhan from Wednesday, the third day of the final.

As far as the match is concerned, Cheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada gave a masterclass in defensive batting with a five-hour partnership on day two, taking Saurashtra to a strong position in their Ranji Trophy final against Bengal here on Tuesday. Their 142-run stand off 380 balls wore down the opposition who had a slight edge after reducing Saurashtra to 206 for five on the opening day.

Hardik Pandya is back with the Indian team and this will give the side a massive shot in the arm for the ODI series against South Africa. A fit and firing Hardik renders tremendous balance to the side and hence, for Virat Kohli, the all-rounder will be a key player for India.

Ahead of the first match in Dharamsala, the BCCI shared a video of Hardik in the nets where he was seen using the long handle and giving the ball an almighty thwack. The lanky batsman has been in fine run-scoring and ball-hitting form as he returned to competitive cricket last week after undergoing a back surgery and slammed eight fours and 10 sixes in his sizzling innings as Reliance 1 posted 252 for five against CAG in the Group C encounter in the DY Patil T20 Cup.

Playing his second match after surgery, Pandya also claimed five wickets in a splendid all-round show as Reliance 1 bowled out CAG for 151 to claim a 101 run win in their final league match at the Reliance Corporate Park in Ghansoli.

Kevin O’Brien hit a last-ball six as Ireland clinched a consolation super-over win against Afghanistan in the third Twenty20 international in India on Tuesday. With three runs needed for victory off the final ball of the super over, O’Brien cleared the long-off fence to end his team’s 12-match losing streak in T20s against the Afghans.

O’Brien made 26 off 21 balls in Ireland’s 142 for eight after electing to bat first.

Afghanistan, who won the series 2-1, replied with 142 for seven.

“Luckily that last hit came off,” a relieved O’Brien said after receiving the man of the match award.

“We have learnt from game one to game three, about specific plans for each player. You have to adjust quickly and I think we did.”

Afghanistan needed 16 to win off the final six deliveries of normal play, and paceman Craig Young claimed Asghar Afghan for 32 before Rashid hit a boundary off the last ball, taking the game into a deciding over.

Young then bowled a disciplined line and length to keep Afghanistan to just eight runs in six balls.

Gareth Delany also played a key part in Ireland’s win after top-scoring with 37 and then taking two wickets with his leg-spin.

Off-spinner Simi Singh hurt Afghanistan’s middle-order with two wickets off successive balls to send back Mohammad Nabi, for four, and Najibullah Zadran, for nought.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Rahmanullah Gurbaz top-scored with 42 and was named player of the series for amassing 105 runs in the three matches.

Bowlers Naveen-ul-Haq and Qais Ahmad took three wickets each in the Ireland innings.

“I think the wicket was good but our batsmen played some poor shots,” said Rashid."

Cheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada gave a masterclass in defensive batting with a five-hour partnership on day two, taking Saurashtra to a strong position in their Ranji Trophy final against Bengal here on Tuesday. Their 142-run stand off 380 balls wore down the opposition who had a slight edge after reducing Saurashtra to 206 for five on the opening day.

Pujara (66 off 237), who was on five when he retired hurt on day one due to fever, and Vasavada (106 off 287) batted for two sessions and five overs as the hosts reached 384 for eight at the close of play. On day two, the hosts managed 178 runs in 79.1 overs for the loss of three wickets.

Speedster Mukesh Kumar removed Pujara and Chirag Jani in the final session but by then the damage had already been done. Bengal took their first wicket of the day in the fifth over after tea with Wriddhiman Saha effecting a sharp stumping off Shahbaz Ahmed to send back Vasavada.

Bengal coach Arun Lal had rated the pitch as “very poor” on Monday with the odd ball keeping low but their pace attack could not make much use of the conditions after Akash Deep struck thrice on day one.

Run scoring indeed was difficult but Pujara and Vasavada’s plans were crystal clear: tire the bowlers out and pounce on the loose balls. Their stay in the middle may not have been pleasing to the eye but proved to be very effective.

While it was a typical Pujara knock, full of patience, Vasavada, who is coached by the India batsman’s father Arvind Pujara, made a bigger contribution to the team’s cause with a back-to-back hundred and fourth of the season.

Vasavada, who had made a match-winning knock against Gujarat in the semi-final, played with remarkable patience and composure. His innings comprised 11 fours. This was Vasavada’s eighth first-class hundred.

It was a commendable effort from Pujara too, considering that he had not been keeping well ever since his return from New Zealand last week.

Such was the slow pace of the Pujara-Vasavada stand that the first boundary of the bat came in the 15th over of the day when Vasavada pulled Akash Deep.

Bengal, who had bowled 80.5 overs on day one, took the new ball after the 85th over but it did not lead to a breakthrough.

Vasavada brought his fifty with a four off off-spinner Arnab Nandi, driving him past mid-on. Pujara broke the shackles in the following over by stepping out to cover-drive left-arm spinner Ahmed. Soon after, the Test specialist survived an lbw appeal after Bengal went for the limited DRS.

The closest Bengal came to getting a wicket in the afternoon session was when Vasavada straight-drove Mukesh, who claimed the ball kissed his hand before hitting the stumps with Pujara at the non-striker’s end. However, the appeal was turned down as there was no conclusive evidence.

The left-handed Vasavada reached three figures 20 minutes before the tea break as he cut one off Nandi through cover, leading to an intense celebration. The entire dressing room applauded his valuable effort for which he also got a hug from Pujara.

Pujara, who collected five boundaries, got his half-century off 191 balls at the stroke of tea. In the morning and afternoon session combined, Saurashtra scored 133 runs in 58.1 overs. Pujara’s best shot of the day came when he caressed one off Akash Deep between cover and point.

Saurashtra batsman Vishvaraj Jadeja, who scored a half-century on day one, had hoped for 100-150 runs on day two. The home team got more than that."

“We have a security staff and if we have medical concerns, we give it to them and they come up with recommendations. If they think it is too dangerous, they will pull us out....

“We had a nice brief last night from medical staff about the virus going around.. that is a major concern. We are not medical people and we don’t know medicine like they do.

“The big one is the IPL so we decided to let those guys - the free agents if you want to call them that - do the IPL and then afterwards make themselves available,” cricket.com.au quoted Mark Boucher, head coach of South Africa, as saying.

“We’ve still got quite a few games (before the World Cup). From the first of June, which is the Sri Lanka tour, those guys need to make themselves available. Whether we select them is another story. But they need to make themselves available if they want to put their hands up for a World Cup spot,” he further added."

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 10, 2020 16:05 IST

Brian Lara is one of the most celebrated cricketers in the history of the sport. He is the only batsmen to hit 400 in international Test matches while holding numerous records in world cricket. So when lavishes praise on any cricketer then the sporting world takes notice. Recently, the West Indian revealed his favourite cricketer and it just happens to be a current Indian batsman. And he is not talking about Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma.

Brian Lara has admitted that he loves watching KL Rahul play and is a big fan of his batting. Rahul has been great form since the turn of the decade and Rahul scored a magnificent 112 in the third ODI against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui.

“Rahul is just class. He is a great entertainer and a great person to watch bat,” Lara said in an interview to Sportstar.

Lara also talked about the duration of Test matches. Lara said that he is not concerned as long as Test matches are producing results. Lara, who holds the record for the highest individual score in Tests (400 not out), also said that the Day/Night Tests were an “attraction” but not the way forward to popularise the longest format of the game.

Asked about his take on four-day or five-day Tests, Lara told PTI, “My only (thing) from Test cricket is that everyone that watches cricket knows the game is going to end in a result, that in itself will peak in interest.”

“If it is five days, four days, it doesn’t matter. If every game is going to end in a result in someway or some form, I think the interest is going to be created on the first day, on the last day, as long as people know that,” added Lara, who has a staggering 11,953 Test runs from 131 matches.

Lara, who is leading the West Indies Legends in the Road Safety World Series, spoke on the sidelines of a training session."

Updated: Mar 10, 2020 16:02 IST

Former South Africa player Jonty Rhodes believes South Africa should look for different ways and means to win to the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup which will be held in Australia later this year. These comments have been made even as AB de Villiers has made his intentions clear of making a comeback to the national team. “I think it’s interesting because it’s a tough call. You want your best team to play, it’s also tough on the guys who then miss out. You know AB is a very special player so then do you set a precedent for a guy like AB de Villiers if he is not playing for South Africa, I mean why are you selecting him,” ESPN Cricinfo quoted Rhodes as saying.

“I suppose a lot of people watch how he performed at the IPL but just watching him in the Big Bash, he’s such a class player; I’m a big fan of AB de Villiers. I’m just not sure of the precedent. If you want to win a T20 World Cup, you should do anything to win it,” he added.

However, Rhodes also added that if de Villiers is indeed added to the South African team, it would upset a few players who have been doing well in the tournament but will have to miss out on selection.

“You are not breaking any rules, you are setting a slight precedent and you are going to be upsetting a few players who are going to miss out. But a team without AB de Villiers or a team with AB de Villiers... I’d love to see that guy play,” Rhodes said.

“Although difficult to answer that because I’m not somebody who is missing out, I’m also not from the administration about setting this kind of precedent, so I don’t have to make that call. It’ll just be great to see AB de Villiers play at a World Cup again for us,” he added.

The ICC T20 World Cup 2020 will commence from October 18 and will conclude on November 15 in Australia."

Australia head coach Justin Langer hopes his side can find a finisher like former Indian captain MS Dhoni in the near future in the limited-overs format. Langer made this comment before Australia vs New Zealand ODI series which is slated to begin from March 13. As per Langer, this series gives an opportunity to the Australian to look at a batsman who could play the role of a ‘finisher’.

“We’ve been fortunate in the past with a Mike Hussey or a Michael Bevan who are masters at it. MS Dhoni is a master of it, Jos Buttler has been brilliant at it for England,” ICC quoted Langer as saying.

“What I’ve learned is everyone in the world is looking for it,” he added.

“So it’s a role that’s there for someone to grab hold of. No one at this stage has absolutely secured it, have they? But there are good opportunities there for someone to do that,” said Langer.

Former Australia captain Michael Clarke, has however, slammed the timing of Australia’s upcoming ODI series against New Zealand, saying he would be surprised if anyone turns up to the games.

“Absolute token games of cricket,” he said on Big Sports Breakfast. “To be honest, I can’t believe it. I’m a cricket fan through and through, but whoever has made the decision to put these three ODIs on, it’s footy season.

“Cricket season is finished. What a great way to finish it with the women winning the World Cup as well.

“I’ll be very surprised if anybody turns up to watch those games.

C Shamshuddin was on Tuesday ruled out as the on-field umpire for the remainder of the Ranji Trophy final after getting hit around the lower abdomen area on the opening day of the title clash between Bengal and Saurashtra.

Shamshuddin did not take the field on day two after the pain aggravated overnight and he went for a check-up in a local hospital on Tuesday morning.

With S Ravi as the designated umpire, Shamsuddin’s on-field partner Anantha Padmanabhan was the only one officiating in the middle in the first session on day two as local umpire Piyush Khakar stood at square leg.

Post Lunch, Ravi joined Padmanabhan in the middle while Shamshuddin took the role of the TV umpire.

Shamshuddin’s replacement, Yashwant Barde, will join Padmanabhan on day three.

“Shamshuddin felt more pain in the night and went to the hospital in the morning for a check-up. He has been advised a week’s rest,” a Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) spokesperson told"

Two ICC event final appearances in three years show how Indian women’s cricket is coming of age. But what would it take to overcome the final barrier? Dropped catches of Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney early and a nervous batting start in the final probably prompted India captain Harmanpreet Kaur to say they needed to rethink their approach in big games. “If we talk about the last T20 World Cup, we got to the semis, and this time the final. We’re on the right path. Every year we are improving. We just need to think of how to play with focus in the main games. Sometimes we don’t manage that,” she said after the final.

India have improved over the years but Australia and England are still the teams to beat. And unlike in those countries, women’s cricket in India is still not exactly part of the mainstream. India’s senior women’s domestic calendar comprises an inter-state league and a Challenger Trophy in Twenty20 and one-day formats. Apart from that, the BCCI has also been organising a women’s T20 Challenge for three years now. Starting with two teams and just one match in 2018, it is set to expand to four teams and seven matches this season. A BCCI release last month confirmed that the expanded tournament would be played during the week of the IPL playoffs and final. The league stage ends on May 17.

Kaur pins hopes on this tournament to show a way out. “This year, we are hoping for some more games in the women’s challenger. That tournament is very important for us because it is high quality. From there we already got two good players, and hopefully in the upcoming tournaments we can get more.”

This is an area where Australia and England score over India. Australia started the Women’s Big Bash League—an eight team tournament—in 2015, and the game has received a fresh shot of popularity because of that competition. The groundwork starts there even though the national team’s success is something that can’t be controlled. This season WBBL was even moved to a separate time slot ahead of the Big Bash League. England is starting The Hundred where women and men will get equal pay. More importantly, it will ensure women play more games though England already has a 50-over County championship and a three-tier T20 championship. That way, they won’t have to depend on international tournaments alone for quality exposure games. In the 12-month period leading up to the T20 World Cup, India played 17 T20Is, as many as England, and Australia only 14. But add quality competitions like WBBL (59 matches in the 2019-20 season) or the Women’s Cricket Super League (six-team, 32-match T20 league that is being replaced by The Hundred) and there is no surprise the Australians and English are better equipped to cope with the pressure of big matches.

However, women’s cricket in Australia and England has evolved over a century. The first Test series between them was played in 1934-35. Women’s cricket in India had struggled for a few decades and was taken over by the resourceful BCCI only in 2006, transforming the game.

For India, a full-fledged IPL will get them used to playing in front of 60,000 spectators regularly and create a fan following. India is the most important economy in cricket and the right boost in the form of a franchise league could go a long way.

Sunil Gavaskar stressed on this point after the final. “Even if there are not eight teams, a women’s IPL will make a lot of sense. There will be a lot more exposure for women. A lot more talent, which is there but we don’t know at the moment, will come to the fore. And then, as the years go by, Indian women’s team will start winning a lot more trophies,” he told India Today. “To Sourav Ganguly and the BCCI, I would like to say, maybe next year, look at having a women’s IPL because that will unearth lot more talent. The WBBL has given plenty of opportunities to players, even to our players (Smriti Mandhana and Kaur). That is the tournament where you get to play against the best players and learn. That certainly has helped them (Australia) find many more players, just like the IPL has helped them—India men’s team— find many more players.”

Anjum Chopra, who led India to their first ICC tournament final in the 2005 50-over World Cup, however, isn’t sure IPL alone can change India’s approach. “If IPL starts it basically means more matches, more international exposure. Playing more matches helps but I will never say the only solution is a women’s IPL. You also need to work at home. They need to play a lot, whether as an Indian team, as individuals or for other franchises,” she said from Sydney.

India fast bowler Jhulan Goswami, the world’s leading wicket-taker in ODIs, said: “We already have a women’s T20 series on the lines of IPL for three years now. The BCCI is working on it and I am sure a full-fledged women’s IPL is on the cards. About infrastructure and facilities, I don’t think we lack anything.”

“Beating Australia in Australia is very difficult,” said Goswami. “We did it in the league phase and topped our group. No one expected that. We knew Australia would come hard at us in the final. One loss shouldn’t be allowed to define a brilliant campaign for India.” What Goswami wants though is more focus on age-group cricket. “This is the right time to do it. We need more matches in the under-16, -19 and -23 categories so that we have a proper supply line established.”

Former India cricketer Sulakshana Naik, a member of BCCI’s Cricket Advisory Committee, echoed the views of Chopra and Goswami. “Playing with and against foreign players in a league can help our cricketers grow, especially those who are coming up. But we jump to conclusion that we should have a big league. We should instead improve our domestic circuit. Just running behind leagues won’t help. We’ve to focus on grassroots and whether the girls are getting their basics right.”

Chopra said: “The BCCI has been brilliant at providing infrastructure and financial support. The women’s team gets the same support from BCCI as the men’s team and they can go to NCA too. They have also allowed players to play in international leagues,” she said. Chopra feels most of the preparation should be at domestic level. “Many of these players were in the 2017 final (ODI World Cup) and 2018 semi-final losses (T20 World Cup, both to England). So they are acquainted with the pressure. The way forward is to prepare better. There are a lot of domestic club-level matches too. BCCI can’t do anything there; the players need to do that.”"

Updated: Mar 10, 2020 12:34 IST

It wasn’t totally surprising that playing a World Cup final in front of over 86,000 people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground left India overwhelmed against the formidable Australia on Sunday. Not even seasoned cricketers are immune to stage fright, let alone this young Indian women’s cricket team.

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led outfit was the youngest of all teams at the Women’s T20 World Cup with 10 of the 15 players in the squad aged 23 or under. The average age of India’s playing eleven in the final was 23.9, which included three teenagers without counting 16-year-old Richa Ghosh, who came on as a concussion substitute. The Australian team’s average age was 26.4 with 20-year-old Georgia Wareham the youngest member of the eleven.

However, one major factor that cost India the final, inexperience, also gives the biggest hope for this current band of women that it can turn into a formidable force over the next four-five years, a group that would have learnt valuable lessons from this tournament and developed further in skills and mindset.

“Definitely, I see India lifting an ICC trophy over the next few years,” Sulakshana Naik, former India woman cricketer (46 ODIs, 31 T20s, two Tests), said. “These young girls have shown they have enough potential and with some more experience they will be there. We just need to stay patient, invest fully in them and give them time to grow.”

That process of investment, Naik and former India women’s team coach Tushar Arothe say, involves playing as many international matches as possible against top sides like Australia and England, home and away. The more the likes of Shafali Verma (16), Jemimah Rodrigues, Radha Yadav (both 19), Taniya Bhatia (22) and Ghosh do that, the more they will fine-tune their game and learn to bat under pressure in crunch games.

“These youngsters need to be playing competitive cricket constantly against tough teams to boost and upgrade their skill level,” Arothe said.

“It will also help them get rid of the inferiority complex. If they keep playing sides like Australia, they will not feel daunted when they play big matches. They will learn a lot of things, not just in batting and bowling but also mindset and how to manage pressure.”

Biju George, former fielding coach of the women’s team, reckoned there has been a radical improvement in the team since 2017 and that there is no reason why the progress can’t be maintained. “Earlier, we used to play well only at home, but now we have started to win matches even in Australia, England and New Zealand. That has been a big difference,” he said.

Another factor that could prove decisive is not tinkering with the natural flair of the young brigade. Shafali, for example, can be taught to adapt as per the situation, but the foundation of her game—which is to play attacking shots—might be best left untouched.

“The likes of Shafali, Jemimah, Richa, etc., they’re there because of their talent and people are looking at them as the future of Indian cricket. I would not want to change somebody’s natural talent. Today, Shafali can hit the first ball for six. Maybe two years down the line, she will be watchful initially when the ball is doing something. So, her temperament will improve, and that will only come with experience and maturity,” Naik, a former wicketkeeper-batsman, said.

One aspect that needs lot of attention going forward is strength conditioning, said Arothe. “Overall, fitness and agility needs to improve, and that is up to each individual. Teams like Australia, England and West Indies play on power. Our technique and natural talent is way superior to them, but they compensate it with their power. We need to work on that to become world beaters,” he said.

He is confident this young team can wear the tag of world beaters in a few years, be it in the 20-overs or 50-overs formats. “This team has the potential to win a World Cup. The ingredients are all there. They need to be positive and work hard towards it.”"

Updated: Mar 10, 2020 12:24 IST

BCCI’s decision to reduce the amount that the eight franchises would have received had met with opposition. The franchises have written to BCCI asking it to reconsider the move, but IPL chairman Brijesh Patel told HT: “The franchises’ views will be put up before the IPL Governing Council that will meet soon. Then we will decide. But it’s unlikely that we can have any change.”

Franchises of the four teams qualifying for the playoffs were being awarded from a ‘playoff standing fund’ of R50 crore, with the winners getting R20 crore. This prize fund has been halved by BCCI, which has argued that the franchises are now self-sufficient. “This fund was in place because the franchisees told us in 2013 that they were not making money in IPL. Now they are doing well. It’s just loss in profits (for them),” Patel said.

In the letter to BCCI, the franchises call the fund “a strong incentive for teams to continually improve the performance”. It adds: “We collectively believe rewinding that will be a step backward in the progress of the IPL.”

The other point of contention is the BCCI decision to raise the venue staging fee for franchises from R30 lakh to R50 lakh, payable to the associations that stage the matches. “The associations bring about no improvement in stadium facilities and want more money,” a franchise official told HT.

BCCI is not inclined to reconsider this move either. “It’s not just decided that the franchises have to pay the associations more, even BCCI is paying them more. The state unit’s expenses too have gone up,” Patel said.

However, some franchises are upbeat. They are hopeful as their presenting a collective view itself is a first and reflects strength, and feel some among the BCCI top brass could be considerate. “It’s important for BCCI to respect the franchises as stakeholders and give them their due. We will be watching BCCI’s response closely,” a top franchise official said."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 23:50 IST

Trust Niranjan Shah— the 75-year old patron of Saurashtra cricket—to bring some noise to the Ranji final, played in front of empty stands. Thanks to him, an old-fashioned music band—the kind seen in local Navratri celebrations—was summoned to the ground ahead of the first day’s play. But once the home captain, Jaydev Unadkat, won the toss and chose to bat first, the first session of play went along expected lines. Saurashtra’s openers, Harvik Desai and Avi Barot, saw off the initial movement which lasted all of two overs and then the forward-defences and cover-drives started occurring regularly.

Bengal’s vastly improved pacer, Ishan Porel, got a few balls to rise and miss the outside edges of the openers’ bats. But on a batting wicket—possibly curated to negate the in-form fast bowling trio of Porel, Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar—Shahbaz Ahmed’s left-arm-spin had to be introduced as early as the seventh over of the innings.

On the eve of the final, Bengal head coach Arun Lal had spoken of the secret behind his bowling group’s success this season, and their ability to pull together six good balls in an over. “You need special batting ability like a Pujara to handle that, when runs are not coming,” he had said.

Bengal’s bowling discipline was going to come in handy on a warm day. They did not let their shoulders droop when the going was slow and difficult, and continued to produce that odd ball to rear off a pitch that was fast becoming unpredictable and two-paced.

Porel took only one wicket but bent his back all day. Mukesh, the medium-pacer whose six-for put Bengal into the final, put in yet another honest day’s work while Akash Deep produced the wicket-taking deliveries.

At the same time, Bengal’s shoddy fielding ensured that the bowlers had to toil harder as both openers were put down in the morning session and Saurashtra went to lunch at 77/0. Spinner Ahmed was the first to strike, getting Desai to prod at one and silly point did the rest to finish the promising innings on 38. Then Akash Deep finally got his reward, dismissing Barot— who played half forward to a full length delivery and was caught behind—for a well made 54.

Ahmed then plugged the scoring, bowling at the batsman’s blind spot until left-hander Arpit Vasavda walked in at No.4 to negate his angle. Soon after, Viswaraj Jadeja managed to break the shackles with three back-to-back boundaries of an Ahmed over, the 58th of the innings. The second session gave Saurashtra 80 runs for the loss of the openers.

The runs were at a premium but the home side took solace in the fact that Pujara was yet to bat. The Test mainstay, however, walked in at No.6 and retired from his innings after just 24 balls. The reason for both occurrences was the same. “He felt ill last night,” Saurashtra skipper Unadkat said later. “He was feeling feverish because of a throat infection.”

Jadeja too lost his wicket for 54, bowled by Akash Deep after leaving a gap between bat and pad. Sheldon Jackson was the next to go, missing a Porel in-swinger that kept low. And Saurashtra was 182/4 when Pujara walked in and soon walked out, retired hurt. This forced Chetan Sakariya to play the nightwatchman’s role, but that didn’t last long after Akash Deep dismissed him for 4 runs and Saurashtra were wobbling at 206/5 at stumps. The hosts still have Pujara undismissed, but the fear remains that he could well run out of partners.

Poor wicket: Lal

Lal later said he was unimpressed by the pitch. “It is a very poor wicket. The ball is not coming on to the bat and keeping low on Day 1 itself,” said Lal. “The BCCI should look at this.”

Jaydev Shah, president of SCA, was dismissive of Lal’s comments. “Only one wicket was lost when Saurashtra’s 100 came up. It’s a good, fighting wicket.”"

Soumya Sarkar and Liton Das struck half-centuries as Bangladesh crushed Zimbabwe by 48 runs in the first Twenty20 international of a two-match series in Dhaka on Monday. Soumya hit an unbeaten 62 off 32 balls, his second Twenty20 half-century and a career best, after an in-form Liton made 59 off 39 balls to guide Bangladesh 200-3 in the 20 overs. The visitors were never up to the task when replying to the handy score and were bowled out for 152 runs in 19 overs to suffer their biggest Twenty20 defeat against Bangladesh.

Leg-spinner Aminul Islam grabbed three wickets for 34 runs and Mustafizur Rahman finished with 3-32. The other new-ball bowlers rattled Zimbabwe in the opening batting Powerplay to reduce the tourists to 3-37. Tinashe Kamunhukamwe was top scorer for Zimbabwe with 28 before Aminul forced him to give a catch to Liton at long-off.

Aminul took the wicket of Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams (20) from the next ball to break the back bone of the batting line-up. Richmond Mutumbami and Doland Tiripano also made 20 runs each. Carl Mumba provided late blitz with 25 off 16 balls but could only delay the inevitable.

Liton earlier set the platform for Bangladesh’s highest-ever Twenty20 score against Zimbabwe with a 92-run opening stand with Tamim Iqbal, who made 41 off 33 balls. Teenage debutant Wesley Madhevere dismissed Tamim to break the stand and Sikandar Raza trapped Liton leg before to end his superb innings, which featured five fours and three sixes.

Soumya took the charge to ensure Bangladesh surpassed their previous highest score of 175 runs against Zimbabwe. He struck four fours and five sixes, including two in the last two balls of the innings off Chris Mpofu to lift Bangladesh to 200. “It was pleasing to see how the batters performed. Tamim and Liton gave us the start we wanted, and Soumya finished off really well,” said Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad.

Zimbabwe captain Williams lamented their performance. “We missed our length with the ball, and partnerships at the top were required and that let us down,” he said. The second and final match of the series will be held at the same ground on Wednesday."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 20:34 IST

Former skipper Faf du Plessis’ long experience of playing in IPL and international cricket in India will come in handy during the upcoming three-match ODI series, feels South Africa head coach Mark Boucher. The series starts in Dharamsala on February 12. Du Plessis, who last played an ODI during the 2019 World Cup, had an indifferent T20 series against Australia, with scores of 24, 15 and 5. “If you go to a place like India, you need to find a balance between youth and experience. I think Faf is really doing well in ODI cricket for South Africa. The last time he played, he got a hundred. He knows the Indian conditions very well,” Boucher said during the team’s pre-departure press conference on Sunday.

The South African team reached India on Monday morning and will take a chartered flight to Dharamsala on Tuesday. Boucher feels that having Du Plessis also means he will have some selection headaches, which is a good thing to have.

“It’s a good headache to have. Just him being around the squad will add a lot of value and experience as well. We will look at conditions and then put together combinations. Why you would want to have Faf is because he has done really well in those (Indian) conditions.”

While South Africa lost the T20 series 1-2 to Australia, they blanked the visitors 3-0 in the ODIs, which gives them confidence going into the series against India. “T20s are important this year given we have the T20 World Cup. But in general, Proteas and Cricket South Africa (CSA), we need to find ourselves growing.

“We have just beaten a very good team now. We needed confidence and it will certainly give us a lot of confidence.” The former wicketkeeper said that Indian conditions will be tough for a lot of visiting players, who will be touring the country for the first time.

“India is going to be a tough test. Different conditions. Lot of guys haven’t played a lot of cricket in India as well. What’s impressive is guys have responded to the messages we have sent out to them on batting and bowling perspectives.”"

Bengal coach Arun Lal on Monday rated the pitch for their Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra as “very poor” and said the BCCI should probe how such a sub-standard surface was prepared for the big game. Far too many balls kept low on the opening day, especially in the final session, as Saurashtra reached 206 for five at close of play. “Very poor wicket. The board has to look into things like these. The ball is not coming up. This is not good for cricket. The ball is not getting off, it is dusting, reversing. Very poor,” Lal, who played 16 Tests and 13 ODIs for India, said after the day’s play.

The 64-year-old felt the curator did not do his job when asked if the final should have been held at a neutral venue. “No, net necessarily (on neutral venue). You have got neutral curators. The board should look into it. Send your curator 15 days before the game. Even the curator has not done a good job.”

Asked if he would speak to BCCI boss Sourav Ganguly on the matter, Lal said: “That is not my job. They should look into it on their own.” The potent Bengal pace attack targeted the stumps in the final session with the ball keeping low, getting three wickets in return. The visitors got two in the afternoon session and none in the morning.

“We had to attack the batsman (in third session). You have to contain runs, like I said it is a poor wicket. Medium pacer is bowling with one slip and there is no chance of ball carrying it to slips. It would be a disgrace if the ball starts rolling through on day three,” said Lal. Talking about the game, Lal said there is a long way to go and he is satisfied after day one.

Also read: Coronavirus impact: Likely restrictions on ‘fan interactions’, ‘selfies’ during IND vs SA series

“Yes, I am. This is a long game. 15 sessions have to be played, we have played three. We will fight till the end whatever the result. We don’t focus on the result. We focus on what we do best. If we keep them to under 300 in the first innings, I will be happy.”

On Sudip Kumar Gharami making his first-class debut in a big final, Lal added: “He is a young boy and immensely talented who is playing U-23 for Bengal. Someone else made his debut in the Ranji final and went on to captain India successfully. May be he would emulate him (referring to Ganguly).”"

The cricket crazy fans love getting up close and personal with star cricketers, something that might not be possible in the wake of rising number of Coronavirus (COVID 19) cases in India. Currently, 43 people have been tested positive for COVID 19 in India with a sizeable number being Italian tourists. It could well start with the upcoming ODI series against South Africa where the likes of Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis have been briefed about health safety measures, including restrictions on “fan interaction”, “selfies”, etc.

But it will not be restricted to the South Africa series alone and the cash-rich Indian Premier League, starting March 29, could also have some strict health-related guidelines which will bar a cluster of fans from engaging with players, trying to shake hands or come close for a selfie.

Also read: ‘The wait is finally over,’ MS Dhoni returns to the net ahead of IPL 2020 - WATCH

“Players have been briefed on preventive measures while they are travelling overseas. These measures cover a variety of protocols to follow for the safety of both themselves and those around them. Fan interaction, selfies and pictures were included in the brief,” a source close to the South African team management told PTI on condition of anonymity.

There has been specific health advisory on avoiding large gatherings and the South African team’s medical unit and their security officers are expected to take appropriate measures to ensure that the players don’t get mobbed for selfies. In fact, South Africa head coach Mark Boucher has indicated that his players might also do away with handshakes during the India series if the medical team instructs, similar to the guidelines that England players will be adhering to during the Sri Lanka series.

There have been suggestions about having Indian Premier League closed doors as the matches will be available on television as well as streamed live on digital platforms. However, a senior BCCI official said that having IPL closed doors is not an option.

“Did you guys check out what was the attendance during the ATK vs Bengaluru FC Indian Super League play-off game? It was close to 60,000 (50,000 plus). So why would we bar public viewing?” he questioned. However, he didn’t rule out issuing a health advisory which will prevent players from attending large gatherings.

The problem with IPL is that all franchises more or less have fan engagement activities, which is a part of their sponsorship commitments. It is still not clear whether franchises will curtail the number of fan engagement programmes that they organise during the course of the tournament."

Season 13 of the IPL is by far the most anticipated ever as can be seen in the incessant fan chatter. The fan banter which inspired the #KhelBolega campaign was launched by Star Sports in tandem with the BCCI recently. With two World Cups and three IPL titles in his storied career, MS Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the best captains in the history of the sport. But many have been wondering if “The Thala” can still lead from the front, especially since he has been out of action since the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

In a new TVC launched by Star Sports & BCCI, the Chennai Super Kings captain, MS Dhoni shuts down his detractors with poise. The film takes place in an aircraft where a couple are laughing at a meme on Thala Dhoni, only to see him noticing them, completely undeterred from the next seat. Dhoni calmly puts on his headphones, but not before cheekily commenting about the noise around him.

While Thala still commands the love and affection of the “Yellove Army”, fans of other IPL teams have been doubting Dhoni, given his absence from the field, and his ageing CSK squad on social media. Captain Cool’s response will certainly boost CSK fans’ hopes of a fourth IPL title. Till then, let the fan banter continue, as starting March 29th - the Game will do the talking - #KhelBolega."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 18:41 IST

West Indian batting legend Brian Lara is not concerned about the duration of Test matches as long as they are producing results. Lara, who holds the record for the highest individual score in Tests (400 not out), also said that the Day/Night Tests were an “attraction” but not the way forward to popularise the longest format of the game. Asked about his take on four-day or five-day Tests, Lara told PTI, “My only (thing) from Test cricket is that everyone that watches cricket knows the game is going to end in a result, that in itself will peak in interest.”

“If it is five days, four days, it doesn’t matter. If every game is going to end in a result in someway or some form, I think the interest is going to be created on the first day, on the last day, as long as people know that,” added Lara, who has a staggering 11,953 Test runs from 131 matches. Lara, who is leading the West Indies Legends in the Road Safety World Series, spoke on the sidelines of a training session.

Iconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar and India skipper Virat Kohli have openly come out in support of having five-day Tests. The stylish left-hander, also a former West Indies captain, stressed that a result would keep people’s interest in the longer format of the game.

“You listen to (an) American talk, that is something we hear always, you play for five days and sometimes you don’t have a winner, that could be a little bit of (an issue). A winner in every game should be possible,” he added. The BCCI last year finally embraced Day/Night Tests, following which India played Bangladesh in Kolkata.

“I think it (Day/Night Tests) is an attraction, but I don’t think it is a way forward (for) the game. I don’t think that’s going to bring anybody back. I think it (Test cricket) is something that has gone away from couple of generations and we need to get it back from a very early age.

“May be the ICC or Governing Body is shifting towards T20, may be little bit less concerned about Test cricket, but that is their modus operandi and I have no clue. I just know for me when you see a good Test match it is very special,” he said."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 18:28 IST

Young pacer Akash Deep took three wickets as Bengal kept Saurashtra in check as they ended Day 1 on 206/5 in the final of the Ranji Trophy here on Monday. The home team is also fretting over Cheteshwar Pujara’s health as the India Test batsman looked under the weather before retiring hurt. Akash Deep, 23, returned the day’s best figures of 3/41 while pace spearhead Ishan Porel (1/37) and left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (1/56) picked up one wicket each. Mukesh Kumar, who was the hero of Bengal’s semifinal win over Karnataka at the Eden Gardens, remained wicketless after the first day’s play.

For Saurashtra, Avi Barot (54) and Vishvaraj Jadeja (54) struck half centuries. Arpit Vasavada remained not out on 29 from 94 deliveries with Chetan Sakariya getting dismissed off the final ball of the day.

The biggest cause of concern for the home side was Pujara, joining his state side for the final, ambling off towards the dressing room after feeling unwell late into the third session.

Pujara pushed himself down to No.6 from his usual No.3 position after Saurashtra elected to bat first. The Jaydev Unadkat-led side were 182/4 when Pujara walked out to bat and was looking solid on five from 24 balls. But as his stay at the crease progressed, the 32-year-old looked uneasy and under the weather before eventually failing to continue.

Just back from New Zealand where India lost the Test series 0-2, Pujara walked back to the dressing room looking dazed.

It was a blow for the home team who were struggling after the in-form Bengal pacers came back to take four wickets in the second and third session to blunt Saurashtra’s good start.

The opening pair of Harvik Desai (38) and wicketkeeper Barot shared a 82-run stand before Shahbaz had Desai caught at silly point by substitute Abhishek Raman.

Barot followed suit soon after with India Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, also joining the Bengal team for the final, taking a catch off Akash Deep.

Vishvaraj and Vasavada looked good for a long partnership, but Akash Deep came up with a beauty to rattle the former’s stumps.

In-form Sheldon Jackson (14) was trapped in front by Porel as Saurashtra suddenly found themselves in a spot of bother.

Pujara and Vasavada also looked good but once Pujara left the field, it was downhill for the hosts who also lost Sakariya (4) off the final ball of the day following a correct caught behind DRS review off Akash Deep’s bowling.

Saurashtra beat Gujarat in a tense semifinal to reach here while Bengal stunned Karnataka in the last-four clash. Playing their fourth final in eight seasons, Saurashtra are looking to win their maiden Ranji Trophy title, while two-time winners Bengal have not won the competition since the 1989-90 season when their head coach Arun Lal was part of the team.

Both Pujara and Saha joined Saurashtra and Bengal, respectively, following their Test assignment for India in New Zealand. India lost the two-match series 0-2. While Pujara played both the matches, Saha was dropped for Rishabh Pant.

MEanwhile, Sudeep Gharami made his first-class debut for Bengal on Monday.

New Zealand are set to play a three-match ODI series against Australia, and former World Cup-winning Aussie captain Michael Clarke is not impressed with the decision to play the series. Speaking in an interview to Big Sports Breakfast, Clarke called the series as “token games of cricket” implying that too many series are being played to gather revenue. “Absolute token games of cricket,” he was quoted as saying by Cricket.com.au.

“To be honest, I can’t believe it. I’m a cricket fan through and through, but whoever has made the decision to put these three ODIs on, it’s footy season. Cricket season is finished. What a great way to finish it with the women winning the World Cup as well. I’ll be very surprised if anybody turns up to watch those games,” he said.

New Zealand pacer Trent Boult has expressed his dissatisfaction with Clarke’s comments. Speaking to reporters at Auckland Airport on Monday, Boult said: “Michael Clarke doesn’t sound too happy for some reason, I don’t know what’s got under his skin.”

“I don’t know why the series is token. There’s a good trophy up for grabs between both teams and we can’t wait to hopefully lift it. Australia’s an awesome place to play cricket. They’re big stadiums compared to the ones here. I’m sure there will be a crowd there with a few supporters,” he added.

The South African cricketers could avoid the customary handshakes during their stay in India, head coach Mark Boucher has said as the number of reported positive coronavirus cases in the country crossed 40 on Monday.

The number of positive cases in India stands at 43 at the moment and the South African team that landed in the national capital for three ODIs in the wee hours of Monday, will “strictly adhere” to the healthcare protocols.

“With regards to handshakes and type of stuff that’s concern, so it will probably be fine if we do the same if it comes to that. I think it’s a way to stop anything from happening to our guys,” Boucher told the media during his pre-departure press conference when asked about shaking hands with the opposition team’s players.

“I think it’s out of respect for players around you and not to pass on something that you might have,” the former Proteas stumper added.

South Africa went ahead with the tour only after their medical and security team gave a go-ahead after doing a risk assessment.

“Look we have a security staff and if we have medical concerns, we give it to them and they come up with recommendations. If they think its too dangerous, they will pull us out and they are no different,” he said.

Covid19 is a concern and that’s what they have been briefed, said Boucher.

The Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore have always been regarded as one of the most glamorous outfits in the Indian Premier League (IPL), but they also carry the tag of underachievers because of the fact that they have never won the title despite reaching the final on three occasions. One of only five teams to have played all 10 seasons – Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and Kings XI Punjab are the others – they are yet to win a title. They did come close thrice, finishing runners-up in 2009, 2011 and 2016, and were also third in two editions (2010 and 2015).

THREE INDIAN PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Virat Kohli – The Indian cricket team skipper is easily one of the best batsmen in the world right now irrespective of the format and with a strong team at his disposal this time, he will surely be looking to add the elusive Indian Premier League (IPL) title to his already stacked list of accomplishments.

Yuzvendra Chahal – The wrist spinner has impressed both experts and fans alike on the international stage and when it comes to the IPL, he has been the most lethal bowling option for RCB.

Shivam Dube – The young Mumbai all-rounder has been a consistent performer in the domestic circuit over the last couple of seasons and with RCB paying an impressive Rs 5 crore for him last year, he will now look to be the mainstay in the side.

THREE OVERSEAS PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

AB De Villiers – De Villiers is among the most aggressive batsmen in the world and he can tear apart any attack with his 360-degree stroke-play. He has been a part of the franchise since 2010 and the onus will once again be on him to guide his team to success.

Aaron Finch – The Australian limited overs captain is a great addition to the RCB squad and his presence should bolster the middle order. He will be key as could walk out after AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli.

The Kings XI Punjab had a repeat of IPL 2018 in IPL 2019. They started off well, were one of the strongest contenders to seal a play-off berth at the half-way stages of the league but lost track completely in the second half. They lost four in a row in the second-leg and were out of the play-off’s race and had to be satisfied with a No.6 finish with six wins in 14 matches.

Ahead of IPL 2020, the Punjab-based franchise took some tough calls including the trade of captain R Ashwin with the Delhi Capitals.

In IPL 2020, which is slated to begin from March 29, the Kings XI Punjab will be led by India wicket-keeper batsman KL Rahul. He was retained in the squad along with the likes of Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, and Mohammed Shami.

The franchise roped in the likes of Glenn Maxwell, who will enjoy his second stint with the franchise, Sheldon Cottrell, India U19 leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi and young pacer Ishan Porel.

The Kings XI Punjab have never won the IPL and have reached the final only once. The management will be hoping that their big guns - Gayle and KL Rahul come to the fore and put up consistent performances throughout the season.

FULL SQUAD

KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Mohammed Shami, Nicholas Pooran, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Chris Gayle, Mandeep Singh, Mayank Agarwal, Hardus Viljoen, Darshan Nalkande, Sarfaraz Khan, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Murugan Ashwin, K Gowtham, J Suchith, Glenn Maxwell (10.75 crore), Sheldon Cottrell (8.5 crore), Deepak Hooda (50 lakh), Ishan Porel (20 lakh), Ravi Bishnoi (2 crore), James Neesham (50 lakh), Chris Jordan (3 crore), Tajinder Dhillon (20 lakh), Prabhsimran Singh (55 lakh) Prabhsimran Singh, Agnivesh Ayachi, Harpreet Brar, Murugan Ashwin.

THREE OVERSEAS PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Chris Gayle

The explosive Chris Gayle had a pretty good IPL 2019. He scored 490 runs in 13 matches at a strike rate of 151.02. He scored four fifties and hit 34 sixes with an unbeaten 99 being his best. Gayle would certainly look to get Kings XI Punjab to a blazing start in this IPL.

Glenn Maxwell

Maxwell did not feature in the last edition of IPL but the Australian all-rounder is set to make a comeback into the tournament in this season. However, an injury might force him to miss the first half of the tournament. He is set to undergo elbow surgery later this month. This will be Maxwell’s second stint with KXIP. He was bought by the franchise in 2014 and after enjoying a great opening season, he was released in 2018.

Nicholas Pooran

Nicholas Pooran was expected to be one of the biggest buys for Kings XI Punjab in last season but the West Indian left-hander failed to make an impact, scoring only 168 runs in 7 matches. KXIP, however, showed faith and retained him for IPL 2020. The 24-year-old Trinidadian would be looking to repay the faith with an impactful performance this season.

Three INDIAN PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

KL Rahul

KL Rahul has emerged a man for every situation for Team India in the past few months. He did keep wickets for KXIP in the last two seasons of IPL but this time the Karnataka cricketer was given the responsibility for India, in which in excelled. Rahul was the Player of the Series in the T20I series against New Zealand, which India won by 5-0. There will be added responsibility of captaining KXIP on KL Rahul this IPL. He had bumper IPL 2019 for KXIP, emerging as their highest run-getter with 593 runs in 14 games at a strike rate of 135.38.

Mohammed Shami

The Kings XI Punjab have decided to retain Mohammed Shami after the paceman was back reckoning for Team India in the shortest format of the game. Shami had his best season in IPL in the last edition of the tournament with KXIP. He played all the 14 matches – the first time in his career – and picked up 19 wickets at an economy rate of 8.68.

Ravi Bishnoi

With 17 wickets, 19-year-old leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi emerged as the highest wicket-taker of ICC U19 World Cup 2020, in which India finished as runner-ups to eventual winners Bangladesh. The deceptive googly and ability to fox the batsmen in the air, Bishnoi is expected to be one of the key weapons for Kings XI Punjab in IPL 2020.

The Sunrisers have retained most of their core players and have also appointed David Warner as the captain of the side. Warner and Bairstow have forged a sensational opening pair and with an in-form Manish Pandey to bolster the middle order, the side has a great chance to go all the way. Their biggest strength is their bowling attack as well as the presence of superb all-rounders in the arsenal.

THREE INDIAN PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Manish Pandey – He was quite a revelation when he was promoted to number 3 last season and has continued his good form right through this season and also for the Indian team. He will be a key component of SRH’s top order, more so with the T20 World Cup slated to be held later this year.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar

Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been a key figure for the Sunrisers Hyderabad for several years. The speedster will look to pick up early wickets and lead the bowling unit once again. Bhuvneshwar is lethal in the first six overs by swinging the new ball both ways.

Siddarth Kaul

Siddarth Kaul was one of the star bowlers in IPL 2018. The speedster can bowl at a quick pace and hits the deck hard with his deliveries. Kaul is the first change bowler in the side. After the ball loses a bit of shine, Kaul takes over and bowls with the spinners in action from the other end.

THREE OVERSEAS PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

DAVID WARNER

David Warner will lead the side this season and has been in sensational form in white ball cricket for Australia. He is very consistent in the IPL and will look to continue his good run this season.

Kane Williamson

Kane Williamson was the highest scorer in IPL 2018 with 735 runs. He was replaced by Warner as captain, but remains an important cog in the side. He was brilliant against India in the T20I series and showed he has the game to be successful even in the shortest format.

Rashid Khan

Rashid Khan has been the trump card for Sunrisers Hyderabad and he will be the main bowler once again in this season. The Afghan leg-spinner is a star figure and has been a dominant force all across the world in this format.

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 18:19 IST

Former pacer Brett Lee on Monday said he found it difficult to watch Indian batting sensation Shafali Verma in tears during the crushing women’s T20 World Cup final loss to Australia but he expects the 16-year-old to bounce back strongly. First-time finalists India were outplayed by 85 runs as Australia claimed their fifth world title here on Sunday.

Verma, who had a successful run till the final, could not click in the summit clash and was seen sobbing after the final.

“I really felt for Shafali Verma at the end, it was tough seeing her in tears but she should be very proud of the way she’s performed in Australia,” he wrote in his column for the ICC.

“To come out here and face your first tournament head-on is testament to her talent and mental strength, and she’s only going to get better from here,” he added.

“...she’ll learn from this experience and come back stronger. Moments like this can define you in a positive way...Don’t be surprised to see her put a big score on the Aussies the next time they play.” The former pace ace said he expects the Indian team to come back strongly after the 85-run hiding.

“...it was a disappointing night for them but they’ll certainly be back - this is not the end for them, this is just the start,” Lee wrote.

“They’d never played in a Final before and we saw in Melbourne how vital that experience is, it takes a long time to get settled and by the time they did, unfortunately the game was gone.

“Playing in front of a crowd like that takes plenty of getting used to so they’ll be better for it, and should take a lot of heart from the way they played in Australia,” he added.

Lauding Australia’s performance, Lee said the way Alyssa Healy (75) and Beth Mooney (78) started the proceedings on Sunday, he was reminded of the 2003 ODI men’s World Cup final which Australia won against India. “Sometimes you can bat a team out of the game in that first half, which Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn did for us in Johannesburg,” he said. “Scoreboard pressure means so much more in a Final and, as we saw at the MCG, India just couldn’t get the momentum needed for the chase,” he added."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 14:56 IST

Australia’s Beth Mooney has replaced Shafali Verma at the top of the ICC Women’s T20I Player Rankings for batters after helping her team win the T20 World Cup for the fifth time.

Mooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. Mooney has topped the rankings for the first time, having reached number two in March 2018.

Shafali -- who could score just 2 in Sunday’s final at the MCG, slipped to third position after grabbing the top spot at the end of the league of the tournament while New Zealand’s Suzie Bates remains in second position in the latest update carried out after the knockout stage.

Mooney’s opening partner Alyssa Healy has made a jump of two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semi-final against Australia.

Shafali’s opening partner Smriti Mandhana, who was not in great knick in the just concluded tournament, also slipped by a spot and is currently at the seventh position.

Australia left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen is at a career-best 728 points and fifth place, her best position since a career-best fourth ranking in November 2017. Her team-mates Sophie Molineux and Delissa Kimmince have advanced 10 places each to reach joint-16th and 31st places, respectively.

India’s Deepti Sharma has advanced 10 slots to reach 43rd position among batters and is among the top five all-rounders for the first time."

After the historic triumph in the inaugural season, Rajasthan Royals have not been able to leave a stamp on the competition. However, they have always had a good squad at their disposal but have slipped at crucial moments and this has cost them dear. However, this season could be different as they have snapped up key players and their biggest strength is their overseas contingent.

IPL 2020 Full Schedule

Rajasthan Royals full squad:

Mahipal Lomror, Manan Vohra, Riyan Parag, Steve Smith, Robin Uthappa, David Miller, Ankit Rajpoot, Mayank Markande, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Varun Aaron, Jaydev Unadkat, Kartik Tyagi, Akash Singh, Oshane Thomas, Andrew Tye, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tewatia, Shashank Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Anirudha Joshi, Tom Curran, Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson, Anuj Rawat

Three Indian players to watch out for

Jaydev Unadkat

Unadkat was the most expensive Indian player at the 2018 auction when he was bought for Rs 11.5 crore. He was released but was bought back by the Royals even in these auctions. The left-armer has been in sensational form for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy and has looked menacing each time he has led the attack. He has not been having good IPL seasons in the past and would like to lead the charge this year.

Sanju Samson

Samson has always been impressive for Rajasthan Royals and will hold the key for them even in this season. He has managed to win a place in the Indian team and a good season here could establish him as one of the wicket-keeper batsman for the T20 World Cup slated to be held later this year.

Robin Uthappa

The right-hander has been snapped up by the franchise and he is expected to add a lot of heft to the batting order, more so in the absence of Ajinkya Rahane.

Three overseas players to watch out for

Ben Stokes

After taking the IPL by storm with Rising Pune Supergiant in his inaugural campaign in 2017, Stokes was a little subdued compared to his very high standards last term. One of the best all-rounders in the modern game, the English star will be eager to resume normal service this year.

ALSO READ: ‘Fingers crossed’ - Jofra Archer speaks about his availability for Rajasthan Royals

Jofra Archer

The Sussex all-rounder, who played for West Indies at the U-19 level, has been a phenomenal addition in the England side. He is a world cup winner, but is currently undet an injury cloud. Royals will hope he manages to recover in time to lead the pace bowling attack.

Steve Smith

The Australian will lead Rajasthan Royals this year and will be expected to take charge of the batting order at the top of the order. He has the game and the class to be a world-beater and Royals would hope their skipper leads the way this season.

The only team to have not made it to the final of the Indian Premier League, Delhi Capitals (earlier known as Delhi Daredevils) had a good season last year, as they made their way to the knockout phase. With a young Indian group as its core and a couple of seasoned Indians traded in, this season is another chance for them to aim for the title. Shreyas Iyer has a calm head on his shoulder and will be expected to lead from the front yet again. The likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin will bolster the think tank of the franchise.

ALSO READ: IPL 2020 Full Schedule

They have game changers in their ranks and in Ricky Ponting have the perfect man to nurture the talent. Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer and Marcus Stoinis were all bought in the auctions and will add tremendous value to the squad.

Full Squad

Shreyas Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Jason Roy, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra, Avesh Khan, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada, Keemo Paul, Mohit Sharma, Lalit Yadav, Axar Patel, Harshal Patel, R Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, Chris Woakes, Rishabh Pant, Alex Carey, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande

Indians to watch out for

Shreyas Iyer

The captain has stormed back into the Indian ODI team and will use that confidence to lead the team from the front. A good IPL season will help him stake claim for a place in the team for the ICC T20 World Cup as well.

ALSO READ: Delhi Capitals full fixture, complete schedule

Rishabh Pant

Rishabh Pant will be in direct competition with MS Dhoni in this year’s tournament and a good season with both bat and gloves will be necessary for Pant to make his position safe for the ICC T20 World Cup. His confidence has taken a beating due to his iffy form with the bat in international cricket. He though has been a star performer for the Capitals and needs to be the X-factor his team again.

Ajinkya Rahane

With Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan in the team, Rahane might have to warm the bench in the initial phase. But there has always been a question mark on Shaw’s consistency and that is where Rahane can turn out to be a trump card for DC.

Shikhar Dhawan

Shikhar Dhawan made an immediate impact since coming in from Sunrisers Hyderabad and provided consistency at the top of the order for DC. He too needs a big tournament to make his psotion safe in the national team.

Ravichandran Ashwin

Ashwin was traded in from KXIP and the veteran spinner will look to turn the fortunes of a franchise which has historically struggled in the IPL. With Kuldeep Yadav struggling with his form, this could be a crucial tournament for the off spinner if he wants to resurrect his white ball international career

Overseas players to watch out for:

Kagiso Rabada

Kagiso Rabada is one of the best pacers in the world and he has proven his worth in the IPL time and again. The South African pacer has proven lately that he is a potent force even with the white ball. Pace, accuracy and hostility makes Rabada quite a handful and this is what will enthuse Delhi Capital fans.

Shimron Hetmyer

The hard hitting West Indian had a great tour of India last year and that prompted DC to shell out the millions for him in auction. His IPL record isn’t the best but he is a player who can win a match single handedly. His presence will help lessen the burden of Rishabh Pant down the order.

Sandeep Lamichhane

The young Nepal leg-spinner has been making all the right moves and was good in the limited matches he got last year. He will be a good attacking option for Shreyas Iyer in the middle overs.

After winning four of their first five matches, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) lost six matches in a row in IPL 2019 to dramatically drift away from the IPL playoff race. They finished at No.5 with six wins in 8 matches. KKR have won the title in 2012 and 2014 but for the past three seasons, they have not managed to reach the final.

KKR shelved out a whopping 15.5 crores – the most for an overseas player in the history of IPL - to get Australian all-rounder Pat Cummins. They also got in England’s captain Eoin Morgan and rising young wicket-keeper batsman Tom Banton in their squad to strengthen their top-order.

The Kolkata-based franchise took some tough decisions by letting go of old warhorses like Robin Uthappa, Chris Lynn, and Piyush Chawla. But KKR also showed immense faith in young pacers Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti who did not play a single game in the last edition because of injury.

KKR Squad: Shubman Gill, Siddesh Lad, Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Rinku Singh, Nitish Rana, Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav, Harry Gurney, Lockie Ferguson, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi, Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrier, Pat Cummins, Eoin Morgan, Varun Chakravarthy, Tom Banton, Rahul Tripathi, Pravin Tambe, M Siddharth, Chris Green, Nikhil Naik

Three Indian players to watch out for

Dinesh Karthik

Karthik may have lost his place in the Indian side after a disappointing ODI World Cup but the wicket-keeper batsman continues to be a force to reckon with in T20s. He, however, had a quiet IPL last season compared to his standards. Karthik scored just 253 runs in 14 matches with only 2 fifty-plus scores to his name. The experienced campaigner would be hoping to set that right and steer KKR all the way to the title in IPL 2020.

Shubman Gill

Gill was named the Emerging Player of the Tournament for his Impressive show in IPL 2019. He scored 296 runs in 14 matches but for the better part of the tournament, he batted below No.6. When the right-hander was promoted up the order, he brought immediate success. Gill has come a long way since then. Based on his superb performance for India A, Gill also earned his maiden Test call-up last year. The Punjab batsman will be eager to demonstrate his talents in IPL 2020.

Kuldeep Yadav

The Chinaman spinner is one of the best when it comes to bowling in the shortest format of the game. But he was dropped from the KKR playing XI after a disastrous first-half of the tournament. The left-arm wrist-spinner will also have an eye to that spot in the Indian side for the T20 World Cup later this year and would look to leave a mark in this season of IPL

Three foreigners to watch out for

Andre Russell

The Jamaican is about raw power with a cricket bat and is also a handy option with the ball. Last season, he contributed 510 runs at a phenomenal strike rate of 204.81 and chipped in with 11 wickets. He was practically a one-man army for KKR, hitting 52 sixes in the tournament. KKR will hope for another all-round performance from Russell.

Sunil Narine

Narine remains a consistent wicket-taking threat for KKR. There was a lot of buzz around KKR’s decision to retain him after he picked up only 10 wickets in 12 matches and scored 143 runs with the bat, but franchise showed its faith on a trusted warrior and now it will be up to Narine to repay the faith.

Pat Cummins

The No.1-ranked Test bowler, Australia’s Pat Cummins will hog the limelight when he turns up for KKR in IPL 2020. He was picked up for 15.5 crores in the auctions and the pressure will be on him to deliver.

FIVE INDIAN PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Rohit Sharma – The Indian cricket team vice-captain is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world when it comes to white-ball cricket. Rohit has led MI to four titles and is one of the top-scorers in the history of the league. Rohit blew hot and cold last season, but he is a man in form this year and will look to lead by example.

Hardik Pandya – He is slowly hitting his stride after a long injury lay-off and a fit and firing Hardik Pandya will add tremendous depth to this Mumbai Indians outfit. This will also be his audition before the T20 World Cup.

Suryakumar Yadav – He bas been one of the top performers for Mumbai in the domestic circuit and showed his class even with India A in New Zealand earlier this year. A good season here and he could force his way to the Indian side for the limited overs fixtures and for the T20 World Cup.

Jasprit Bumrah – He found his rhythm in the Test series against New Zealand and this is great news not only for Mumbai Indians, but also for the Indian team. Bumrah is a force to reckon with in the shortest format and will lead Mumbai’s pace attack once again this season.

Ishan Kishan – The young wicket-keeper is a proper talent and a good performance this season could see him extremely close to an Indian call up. He has shown the ability and pedigree to be successful under extreme pressure and all he now needs to do is to maintain consistency.

FIVE OVERSEAS PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Quinton de Kock – South Africa wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock was sold to Mumbai by Royal Challengers Bangalore before the IPL auction last year and he will look to add plenty of depth and panache at the top of the order. He had a reasonably good season last year and is in great form this year which is great news for Mumbai Indians.

Kieron Pollard – Over the years, Windies all-rounder Kieron Pollard has been instrumental in Mumbai reaching the astronomical heights. But the veteran is now on a downward curve and had a rather unfamiliar outing last time around. Pollard will be eager to chance his fortunes for the good this season.

Mitchell McClenaghan – New Zealand pacer Mitchell McClenaghan is almost guaranteed of a place in the side considering what he brings to the table. He brings a lot of aggression to the table and this season, he could share the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah.

Lasith Malinga – Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga is still a potent force for Sri Lanka and will also be a clutch player for Mumbai Indians. He is an IPL veteran and showed his class in the final last year. It remains to be seen if the magic is still there this season.

Chris Lynn – One of the big acquisitions for Mumbai Indians this season was Chris Lynn and now it will be interesting to see the role he gets in the side. On a flat Wankhede track, Lynn can take the game away from the opposition in a matter of overs and all eyes will be on the management as to how they use the big hitter.

The novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the US government's top infectious-disease specialist has said the pathogen is 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.

More than 126,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,624 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 74 as on Thursday.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 13:09 IST

A lawsuit claiming $5 million has been filed against the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) by a company that acquired the rights to hold the Afghanistan Premier League (APL) in 2018.

The board last year postponed the 2019 edition of APL after the league’s commercial partner failed to pay the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) rights money.

The board had terminated the agreement, citing concerns about the integrity of people associated with Snixer Sports, the partners.

“In our endeavour to safeguard the same, we were left with no other option but to resort to legal remedies against the biased and illegal conduct of ACB,” an official of the management company, Snixer Sports, told The Dawn about the lawsuit filed at an arbitration court in London.

“Each franchisee spends close to 1.5 million USD per team and with 5 teams its 7.5 million. Around 2 million will be spent by promoters every season to sustain the league, which pushes the total league cost to around USD 10 million per season. There is no market due of APL season 1 and Snixer has cleared 100 per cent market payments in 60 days of the league commencement despite facing losses of over USD 3 million in the inaugural season,” the official added.

Meanwhile, the board has stated that they terminated the contract because Snixer Sports failed to pay the dues as per the mutual agreement.

“Snixer Sports and people connected to them possessed a severe risk to the integrity of the league. The ICC Anti-Corruption Unit is aware of these risks and are investigating several cases,” ACB spokesperson Mohammad Ibrahim Momand said.

“The ACB is happy that they claimed because we don’t have to pay them, in fact they (Snixers) owe ACB dues of the last (APL) season. They were a risk for APL integrity as well, first of all they have to clear our dues and then our legal team will deal with their legal team or with the court as required,” he added."

Chennai Super Kings are a juggernaut and when on a roll they are almost impossible to stop. MS Dhoni led his team to yet another final but their old nemesis, Mumbai Indians, managed to stop them again. This was CSK’s fifth loss in an IPL final and third at the hands of MI. With the team managing to keep its core intact, CSK will once again be a serious challenger for the title. As has been the case in the past few auctions, CSK didn’t spend a lot. Australian paceman Josh Hazlewood and England’s Sam Curran were brought in, along with veteran leg spinner Piyush Chawla.

Squad: Narayan Jagadeesan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, KM Asif , Ravindra Jadeja, M Vijay, MS Dhoni (c), Josh Hazlewood ,Kedar Jadhav, Harbhajan Singh, Karn Sharma, Piyush Chawla, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Imran Tahir , Deepak Chahar, Faf du Plessis, Shardul Thakur, Mitchell Santner, Dwayne Bravo, Lungi Ngidi, Sam Curran, Monu Kumar, Shane Watson, Sai Kishore

Players to watch out for:

MS Dhoni: This is perhaps the biggest IPL for MS Dhoni in several years. The former India captain needs to prove his credentials with the bat to stand a chance to make it to India’s squad for the T20 World Cup later in the year. Dhoni had an excellent season in 2019, showcasing his power hitting abilities are still intact. But a prolonged absence from the international scene means the seasoned campaigner needs to go all guns blazing this year.

Suresh Raina: Suresh Raina has been an important cog of CSK since its inception and has been one of the leading run-scorers for them in almost all the seasons. The southpaw ended the 2019 season with 383 runs in 17 matches, which was his second lowest aggregate in a season. With the Team India ship having long sailed away, IPL is Raina’s only ticket to stay relevant and he needs to deliver for his team.

Imran Tahir: The South African leg spinner picked up 26 wickets last season, which is the most for a spinner in a single IPL season. The leggie will be a big threat yet again on the slow and sluggish surface in Chennai. His partnership with Harbhajan Singh will be one to look out for yet again.

Shane Watson: The big hitting Aussie opener is nearing the end of a decorated career and he would want to bow out in style. Watson’s virtuoso knock inspired CSK to the title in 2018 but he couldn’t replicate the same year. Watson managed to resurrect his international career with th IPL and he would want to bring the curtains down on his glorious playing days with yet another stellar season.

Dwayne Bravo: The West Indian spent most of last season on the bench due to an injury and he would be raring to go this year. Back in the Windies fold as well, Bravo’s change of pace with the ball has been a big weapon. He continues to be one of the biggest match winners in the shortest format."

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav was the lone Indian to make the ICC Women’s T20 playing XI of the World Cup, which featured teenage sensation Shafali Verma as the 12th player and was dominated by champions Australia.

Five players from Australia’s victorious team made the side of the tournament. Defending champions Australia claimed their fifth title following an 85-run triumph over first-time finalists India on Sunday in Melbourne.

Alyssa Healy, Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning, Jess Jonassen and Megan Schutt were included along with four England players.

Healy and Mooney did quite a bit of damage with the bat and the two reprised their roles as openers in the final XI.

They’re joined by fast bowler Schutt, who took four wickets in the final against India to finish as leading wicket-taker with 13, and left-arm spinner Jonassen.

There is also a spot for captain Lanning, who led Australia from the front both with the bat and in the field.

The side was pulled together by a selection panel featuring commentators and former international players Ian Bishop, Anjum Chopra and Lisa Sthalekar, journalist Raf Nicholson and ICC representative Holly Colvin, the ICC said in a statement.

Yadav had Australia in knots in a dramatic opening game of the tournament. India’s leading T20I wicket-taker took four for 19 in the opener and didn’t look back, bagging three against Bangladesh before rounding off with wickets in each match.

Verma, on the other hand, broke record after record at the top of India’s order.

The 16-year-old scored 163 runs coming at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 158.25.

Healy and Mooney broke their own record set in 2018 with the most runs as a partnership in a Women’s T20 World Cup, with 352 at an average close to 60.

They also made their second century partnership in four innings while Healy lit up Melbourne to record the quickest 50 in a Final and the highest score in the showcase.

The latter was beaten by her partner a few overs later, with Mooney’s unbeaten 78 seeing her reach 259 runs - the most for one player at any edition of the tournament.

The Australian pair are followed in the team by another stellar duo, with nobody bettering the 169-run partnership made by Nat Sciver and Heather Knight against Thailand.

The middle-order batters were in inspired form throughout, Knight becoming the first England cricketer to register centuries in all three formats with her ton against the debutants.

Sciver scored half-centuries in three of England’s four completed matches to end her tournament with 202 runs and two wickets.

South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt only batted in two innings but certainly made her mark on the action. The 20-year-old struck 53 not out to take South Africa beyond Pakistan, with a glorious array of straight and cover drives lighting up the Sydney Showground.

Australia claimed their fifth Women’s T20 World Cup title after defeating India by 85 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the cricketers celebrated the victory in style as they were joined on the stage by popstar Katy Perry. Perry performed before the start of the game and later, joined the champions Australia when they were lifting the trophy. Meg Lanning & Co celebrated the win with Perry while Molly Strano and Sophie Molineux impressed everyone with their dance moves. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan complemented the Australia players for celebrating the win with Katy Perry and said that it is a ‘cool way to celebrate’.

Defending champion Australia claimed its fifth Women’s Twenty20 Cricket World Cup title after thrashing India by 85 runs in Sunday’s final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

That was a very cool way to celebrate winning a World Cup ... 👍👍👍 ... @katyperry & the team on the stage ... Well done all involved #T20WorldCup — Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) March 8, 2020

The International Cricket Council had been hoping to set a world record for the biggest attendance at a women’s sporting event, on the occasion of International Women’s Day. The crowd figure of 86,174 fell short of the 90,185 fans who attended the world cup soccer women’s final between the United States and China in Pasadena, California, in 1999.

But the fans still managed to help create a national record on an historic occasion in Melbourne as women’s cricket took another leap forward, thanks mainly to the breathtaking batting of Alyssa Healy. The opener belted 75 off 39 balls including a record half-century off just 30 deliveries.

The fans rejoiced as Healy struck seven fours and five sixes, following a pre-game show headed by global superstar Katy Perry. Healy and Beth Mooney (78 not out from 54 deliveries) shared an opening stand of 115 in Australia’s total of 184-4, a record for a women’s T20 final.

In reply, India suffered at the hands of Australia’s sharp fielding, slumping to 30-4 in 5.4 overs before being bowled out for 99.

Player-of-the-match Healy, who battled poor form in the build-up to the World Cup, said she fed off the enthusiasm of the huge crowd. Healy’s opening partner Mooney was named player of the tournament after scoring 269 runs at an average of 64.75.

The addition of two new members, including the chairman, in the national selection committee has not changed the panel’s stance on M S Dhoni, who will “have to perform” in the upcoming IPL to be considered for T20 World Cup selection, a top BCCI official told PTI.

The Sunil Joshi-led selection panel met for the first time in Ahmedabad on Sunday to pick a rather “straightforward” squad for the three ODIs against South Africa beginning in Dharamsala on March 12.

Fit-again Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shikhar Dhawan made their way back into the side.

Joshi’s predecessor MSK Prasad had made it clear that the team has moved on from Dhoni and he has to first play to be considered for selection.

Dhoni, who has not played since the World Cup semi-final loss to New Zealand in July, will be making his highly awaited comeback in the IPL beginning March 29.

“It was a pretty straightforward selection meeting and since Dhoni was obviously not in the reckoning this time (for South Africa series), there was no formal talk about his future,” a BCCI source told PTI.

“He will be back in the reckoning only if he has a good IPL. And why only him, there are so many senior and young players who will play in the IPL. If they do well, they are ought to be considered too. So, you could see some surprise inclusions,” he said.

The T20 World Cup will be played in Australia in October-November and the games India play after the IPL leading up to the mega event will also be a factor in the final squad selection.

“But the performance in the IPL could be the clincher,” the source added.

Head coach Ravi Shastri too has hinted that Dhoni could be back after a good IPL but his future remains a subject of intense speculation as he has not played a game in more than seven months.

With his heir apparent Rishabh Pant not setting the world on fire and K L Rahul being groomed into a full-time wicketkeeper-batsman, Dhoni’s comeback cannot be ruled out.

His countless fans will finally get to see him in action when he leads Chennai Super Kings against defending champions Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener at Wankhede Stadium on March 29."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 11:41 IST

On the notice board of Jeevandip society—a Slum Redevelopment Authority building in the Kandivali area of suburban Mumbai—there is a handwritten message in Hindi. Loosely translated, it reads: “People of Jeevandip, come to the Sunrise Hall to watch the match. Yadav ji”.

Yadav ji is Omprakash Yadav, father of 19-year-old left-arm spinner Radha Yadav, and the match is the Women’s T20 World Cup final between India and Australia. Yadav has booked a small party hall two blocks away from his building to witness his daughter play in the big final on the big screen along with the others from the building and the locality. A big deal, you’d think, for a 55-year-old man who runs a makeshift grocery-and-vegetable store. But the hall was given in “dosti yaari (friendship)”—for free, that is—while the arrangements of a laptop and a projector were made by the youngsters of the building. That’s how much they all love Radha here. All Yadav had to do was soak in the excitement and keep his store closed for a day.

“It’s a small loss for my daughter’s big day,” he says. And oh, oblige the seemingly umpteen requests for television bites. It ensures the Yadav family misses the first over of the final. In the hall, there are around 75 people; children seated on the floor close to the screen, the others on chairs set in rows. As the Yadavs settle down, Radha is shown on the screen for the first time, fielding the first ball of the second over. Everyone in the hall dishes out a roar in unison. The final is well and truly on, at least for the Yadavs.

“Bahut jyada run de diye (We have given away too many runs),” Yadav says as the score reads 49 after six overs. “They have still kept Gayakwad on,” he tells his elder daughter Soni an over later.

“Radha will bowl around the 10th over,” Soni, 24, replies.

Soni has seen her younger sister evolve from playing under-arm cricket in a nearby ground with their two brothers and the rest of the boys in the area to the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in a span of seven years. “She loved batting back then, but coach Praful Naik spotted something in her bowling. The turning point came when sir took Radha to Baroda in 2016,” she says.

True to Soni’s word, Radha is summoned to bowl in the 10th over. She concedes 12 runs, as Australia’s opening stand goes well past 100. The energy in the hall quickly turns into palpable nervousness.

“Chalo, Radha, wicket nikalo,” yells Soni before the start of her second over. True to her word again, Radha picks up India’s first wicket, sending back Alyssa Healy after a fine knock. People stand up celebrating; Yadav flashes a restrained smile, while Radha’s mother, Amravati, affords a clap with a wider grin. That the wicket might have come a bit late is known to Yadav.

“She bowled a good last over, but we gave away too many runs overall,” says Gufran Salmani, the owner of a nearby salon where Yadav gets his haircuts.

As the final drifts away from India with a flurry of early wickets, so does the excitement inside the hall, with people slowly choosing to leave. Yadav and Amravati are still seated, though, and they do so till the last ball of the match. “This was just her (Radha’s) first examination, there will be many more opportunities,” Yadav says, without a hint of sorrow. “She will continue to become a better cricketer and a human, and so will this young team.”"

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 11:34 IST

Imran Tahir loves to bowl, he loves to pick up a wicket and he loves to celebrate. It is often a sprint which is also accompanied by flaying arms and chest thumping. It is one of the most glorious and expressive celebrations in cricket, but for New Zealand opening batsman Colin Munro, it is far from impressive.

During the match between Islamabad United and Multan Sultans, things got pretty intense when Munro had few things to say to Tahir and this resulted in quite a heated exchange. It took place in the fifth over when Munro miscued an attempted shot and was caught by Sohail Tanvir. Tahir took off and this irked Munro who turned back and muttered few words. Tahir too hit back and both the players were involved in an unpleasant exchange.

“I am tired of seeing him (Imran Tahir) celebrate like that and I called him a clown and he took it the wrong way and then you saw what he said to me, so we will leave it at that, eh?,” said Munro and he was quoted by Pakistani journalist Saj Sadiq.

Multan Sultans beat Islamabad United by nine wickets (DLS method) to book their berth in the playoffs for the first time. They also became the first team to enter the playoffs this season. The match was reduced to nine overs and Islamabad scored 91 for 7 in the allotted overs. In reply, Sultans chased down the target in seven overs and lost just the solitary wicket."

The centrally contracted Indian players will undergo a series of medical tests at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru to ascertain fitness as well as to assess workload.

The visiting team is accompanied by Cricket South Africa’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Shuaib Manjra, due to the prevalent novel coronavirus threat.

India has recorded 39 cases so far, while the number of infected has gone beyond one lakh internationally. The series’ second and third ODI will be played in Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18).

Shikhar Dhawan, medium pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, all-rounder Hardik Pandya returned to the India ODI squad for three-match series against South Africa starting from March 12. Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar and Pandya proved their fitness in the recently-concluded Dy Patil T20 Cup.

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 11:16 IST

Pakistan batsman Fakhar Zaman, who is currently playing for Lahore Qalandars in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2020 edition, was asked about the international bowlers that he loves to bat against and among the names, there was India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah. Zaman also took the names of England pacer Jofra Archer and experienced Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc. The left-handed batsman described it as a ‘different experience’ while facing these fast bowlers and also added that he likes to face spinners as most wickets are really flat.

“All bowlers are good in international cricket. All of them are tough to face. I personally like Jofra Archer and Jasprit Bumrah. Mitchell Starc is another bowler that I enjoy facing. They are the kind of bowlers who are different from everyone else. When you face them, it is a different experience. I have enjoyed facing a lot of bowlers especially spinners because the wickets used in international cricket are very flat. The ball doesn’t turn too much because of that.” Zaman was quoted by Cricket Pakistan.

READ: ‘Verma ji ki beti’ does Rohtak proud

Earlier, former Pakistan pacer Shoaib AKhtar has lashed out Zaman for being reckless and for not putting his hand up and performing for his side in the ongoing Pakistan Super League.

These comments were made after Zaman, who is playing for the Lahore Qalandars, has struggled to hit any form in the competition. The left-hander has scored 74 runs in three games at an average of 24.66 and a strike-rate of 125.42.

“The person who doesn’t have a brain is Fakhar Zaman. When you have one player [Chris Lynn] who is already playing fast, then Fakhar needs to understand that he can slow down a bit,” Akhtar said in a YouTube video as quoted by Cricket Pakistan. “Chris Lynn is not some Viv Richards. Lynn plays well where there is equal bounce like Australia. He is good aggressive player, but you need just one aggressive player like that.

“Qalandars batting line-up is made up of similar kind of batsmen who just believes in senseless hitting. You can play aggressively and take chances in the powerplay, but in the next 14 overs you need to know how to anchor the innings, take quick singles and then finish well.”"

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar wants the Board of Control for Cricket in India to come up with a plan in order to organise a Women’s Indian Premier League (IPL) in the country from 2021. Gavaskar believes that the Indian team unearthed several talents in the T20 World Cup and having an IPL now would only help the players grow which would be beneficial for the Indian team in the longer run.

“As far as the BCCI is concerned, they are already doing a lot and which is the reason why this Indian women’s team has progressed so much. They went to Australia almost a month before the tournament started, and played a 3-match T20I series (tri-series) against the Australians,” Gavaskar told India Today.

“They did well over there. They were very well acclimated to the conditions and the pitches in Australia. So you have got to give credit to the BCCI for having done that,” he further added.

“To Sourav Ganguly and the BCCI, I would like to say, maybe next year, look at having a women’s IPL because that will unearth a lot more talent. There is already a lot of talent which we see and that will come to the fore with this performance of this Indian team throughout this tournament.

“The Australian cricket board has backed Australian women’s team for a long, long time. The Women’s Big Bash League has given plenty of opportunities to players, even our players. The likes of Smriti Mandhana, Harmanpreet they have played in the WBBL. That is the tournament where you get to play against the best players and learn from that,” the former India captain added.

“It (IPL) has gone deep into the interiors of India. We have got youngsters coming up from the interiors of India and showing their skills. Therefore, that much wider talent pool is available for selection. That’s exactly what happened with the Australian WBBL.”"

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 10:08 IST

Former skipper Shantha Rangaswamy feels the time has come for Harmanpreet Kaur to take a call on her captaincy future as she is much more important to the Indian women’s team as a batter than a leader.

Another women’s cricket veteran Diana Edulji called for “introspection” following the team’s crushing loss in the T20 World Cup final against Australia, while former coach Tushar Arothe slammed the decision to send Tania Bhatia at number three.

The occasion got the better of the Indian team once again as it lost the final by a whopping 85-run margin here on Sunday. Both Shantha and Diana took solace in the performance of 16-year-old opener Shafali Verma and the consistent showing from the bowlers while the star batters disappointed.

“I am very disappointed that such high calibre batters like Smriti, Jemimah, Harman did not click at all. It was a consistent failure of Harman, Smriti, Jemimah and Veda,” Shantha told PTI after India’s heavy loss in their maiden final.

“Shafali was the only one who made significant contributions while the others just chipped in which is not good enough to win a world title.” Questions are being raised about Harmanpreet the captain as well as the batter. Under her leadership, India had lost in the semi-finals in the 2018 edition in the West Indies. Her scores in Australia read 4, 15, 1, 8 and 2.

“I am sure she will know when to give up captaincy and it is time for her review her captaincy. She is a mature person because she definitely is needed in the team much more as a batter than captain, especially in T20s.

“It is worth pondering over. With new selectors, new think tank coming in after the World Cup (this can be reviewed),” said the 66-year-old.

Diana, who had criticised the team’s fitness in the preceding tri-series, said a proper introspection should follow the defeat in the final.

“Let us not be too harsh on them. They had a good run. We broke the semifinals jinx. The loss has shown that T20 is not our forte, our forte is ODI cricket. “It is time for good some introspection on the strengths and weaknesses and put it into practice because the 50 over World Cup is just around the corner (next year),” said Diana, who also captained India and so did Shantha.

Besides the failure of the star batters, running between wickets and fielding let the team down. Shafali, whose only failure came in the final, was instrumental in India’s entry into the final.

“There are lots of positives despite the loss. Shafali was brilliant and spinners and lone pacer Shikha Pandey were brilliant. Alyssa Healy just took the game away from India in the final with her aggressive approach.

“The fact that India had to chase also did not work in their favour as they set totals in majority of the league games,” said Shantha.

Shantha had a word of advice for the sensational Shafali.

“I hopes she takes a lesson out of Harman as far as her fitness is concerned. She needs to improve her running between wickets and fielding and that will come with better fitness.

“She is getting away right now because of her big-hitting prowess. She will be a much bigger asset with improved fitness.” Diana reiterated the need for a mental coach with the team’s performance consistently nosediving in knock-out games of ICC events.

“I want them to get over the loss quickly because they have a big World Cup coming. We need a medium pacer definitely. If Shikha breaks down, then there is no one and fielding and running between the wicket has to improve come what may.

“We also need a mental coach with the team (considering loss in knock out games),” added Diana.

Meanwhile Arothe, who was the team’s coach when it lost to England in the 2017 World Cup final, said, “You cannot send Tania Bhatia at number three as she isn’t a big hitter. If you wanted to take advantage of first six overs, send a hitter.” “It was just one bad day. Every team had one bad in the league stage except India. Everything went against us. The body language was down in the first six-seven overs,” added Arothe."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 09:54 IST

Australia’s cricketers will continue to shake hands, coach Justin Langer said Monday, despite England enforcing a strict fist-bump only policy to prevent spread of the coronavirus. COVID-19 has claimed the lives of three Australians, with the global outbreak forcing a host of sporting fixtures around the world to be cancelled or played behind closed doors.

Australia’s three-game one-day series against New Zealand begins Friday and Langer said there were no plans to change how the team interacts in the dressing room or on the field.

“No, we’ll keep shaking hands... there’s plenty of hand sanitiser in the Australian kits,” he told cricket.com.au Monday following the team’s 3-0 series loss in South Africa.

“I’m sure we’ll just keep shaking hands and move on from that,” he added.

England captain Joe Root last week said his players would be talking sensible precautions on their tour of Sri Lanka.

“We are not shaking hands with each other, using instead the well-established fist bump, and we are washing hands regularly and wiping down surfaces using the anti-bacterial wipes and gels we’ve been given in our immunity packs,” he said.

Langer admitted that some players were exhausted heading into the series against New Zealand having featured in all three formats almost continuously since last year’s World Cup, including the likes of leading batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner.

“The truth is we’ve got some weary boys at the moment, particularly our senior players,” he said.

“They play so much cricket and you think about what they’ve done... since we started the World Cup (in England last year).

“They’re mentally tough guys but it’s a real challenge for us.” The first one-dayer begins in Sydney on Friday with the second two days later, before the series wraps up in Hobart on March 20."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 10:07 IST

Mashrafe Mortaza and Shakib al Hasan have been dropped from the new central contract list announced by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in three different categories.

The BCB, during a meeting of the Board of Directors on Sunday, finalized a list of 16 players to be included in the national payroll, but only seven of them were offered a contract for both red and white ball cricket which will end on December 31 this year.

The decision to exclude the duo was on expected lines as Mashrafe announced his retirement from ODI captaincy and not to be considered as a regular member of the Bangladesh team while all-rounder Shakib is not considered for fresh contract as he is now facing a two-year ban imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for not reporting corrupt approaches.

The ban on Shakib ends on October 29, 2020, which could also mean that he won’t be able to take part in the T20 World Cup, which starts on October 18.

Along with Mashrafe and Shakib, Imrul Kayes, Abu Hider Rony, Syed Khaled Ahmed, Rubel Hossain and Shadman Islam have also been axed from the previous contract.

Meanwhile, batsman Mahmudullah and pacer Mustafizur Rahman have been axed from the Test contract list and handed only a partial contract for white-ball cricket.

Newly-appointed ODI captain Tamim Iqbal, batsmen Liton Das, Nazmul Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mohammad Mithun and spinners Taijul Islam and Mehidy Hasan were the seven players who got a contract for all formats.

Mominul Haque, who leads the side in Test cricket, spinner Nayeem Hasan, pacers Abu Jayed and Ebadot Hossain were given a contract only for red-ball cricket, while Mahmudullah, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mustafizur Rahman, Afif Hossain and Mohamamd Naim were given contracts only for ODIs."

The final did not go according to plan for the Indian cricket team as they were blown away by a dominant Australian side at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. However, there were plenty of positives for the side and they have enough arsenal in the tank to build for future tournaments. However, the loss in the final prompted few users to take a dig at the Indian team and one such Twitter user compared the performance in the final to how the men’s team fared in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan.

Former India opener Aakash Chopra was in no mood to let this jibe go as he took the troll down in a befitting manner. He asked the fan how many times Pakistan managed to reach the knockout stages of a major tournament since their 2017 Champions Trophy victory.

India could not rise to the occasion in the final as Australia stepped up their game and put on a ruthless display. Openers Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney put on a century stand for the first wicket and they powered Australia to 184. The Indian chase never got going as they were bundled out for 99.

“The way we played in the league stages, it was outstanding. It was unfortunate to drop those catches today. Upcoming 1.5 years is important. The future is good for us, we need to trust ourselves. You have to keep learning. The first game was very good, it gave us a lot of confidence. We spent a lot of time together, unfortunate for us not to win today. We have to keep working hard. We are in the right line, every year we are improving. We need to play with more focus. Sometimes, we are not able to give our best,” captain Harmanpreet Kaur said after the match and she could not have been more accurate in her assessment."

The novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the US government's top infectious-disease specialist has said the pathogen is 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.

More than 126,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,624 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 74 as on Thursday. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection in the country.

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

cricket

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 10:07 IST

The Twenty20 World Cup culminated on Sunday with hosts Australia beating India by 85 runs in front of a record crowd for a women’s cricket match in Melbourne.

Here are five things we learned from 17 days of pulsating action:

- Home heroes deliver -

Australia’s star-studded team went into the tournament carrying the weight of expectations on home soil as four-time winners and defending champions.

After a shock defeat to India in their opening game, skipper Meg Lanning read the riot act and they didn’t slip up again, reinforcing their dominance of the sport.

In their sixth final out of seven in the global showpiece, Australia won for a fifth time with a near flawless performance.

“There was definitely some tough times through there but we stuck together as a group, we really just had each other’s back the whole time and it’s just a great group to be a part of,” said Lanning.

- Interest rises -

The popularity of women’s cricket has been steadily on the rise, with the tournament widely seen as taking it to a new level.

More than 86,000 fans swarmed through the turnstiles of the Melbourne Cricket Ground to watch Australia play India in the final -- a record for a women’s cricket game.

The event also marked another move toward gender equality with prize money significantly boosted, although it still fell short of the amount the men receive.

To counter this, Cricket Australia pledged a further US$600,000 to ensure parity if Australia were to win.

Ahead of the final, the International Cricket Council launched a new campaign to attract one million new women and girls to the game in the next 12 months.

- Teenage star shines -

Fearless 16-year-old Shafali Verma came into the tournament promising so much, and she left with her reputation cemented as a future superstar of the game.

She anchored India at the top of the order, playing some breathtaking strokes in racking up scores of 29, 39, 46 and 47 in the group stages, hitting more sixes than anyone else as she injected urgency into the team.

While she misfired in the final, her exploits propelled her to the top of the ICC T20 batting rankings, only the second Indian after Mithali Raj to achieve the feat.

“She brings so much happiness and positivity to the team, always wants to enjoy it,” captain Harmanpreet Kaur said of Verma.

- Rain rethink -

The International Cricket Council came in for stinging criticism for not factoring in a reserve day for the rain-affected semi-finals.

England’s clash with India was washed out, sending India through to the final as the highest finisher in their group.

“You’d hope now there is going to be a rule change... and moving forward, no other team will have to experience going out of a World Cup purely because of rain,” said “gutted” England skipper Heather Knight.

Australia’s semi against South Africa went ahead, but the Proteas’ run chase was also affected by the weather. If it too had been abandoned, South Africa would have made the final.

“I’d rather lose than get a free pass into the World Cup final,” said skipper Dane van Niekerk.

- Smiles and promise -

Thailand came into their inaugural tournament as an unknown quantity, but won over fans with not only gutsy performances, but their smiles and graciousness.

After struggling in their opening three games, they put together an imposing 150 for 3 against Pakistan, their highest score in T20s, before rain ruined hopes of a maiden World Cup win.

Skipper Sornnarin Tippoch said it had been a learning curve and their final game was a statement of what to expect in the future.

“I think that game really put things into perspective of how well we can deal with situations and how well we prepared for the tournament,” she said.

“We couldn’t control the rain but I’m really happy how we controlled the innings and built that innings, making a statement of how we can play cricket.”"

Verma ji ki beti, the placard read, waiting to be raised at the right moment. The whole Verma household, along with the trainees of the Shri Ram Narain Cricket Club here, watched and hoped for their very own Shafali to play a knock worthy of the final.

It never happened.

Throughout the last month, the elder daughter of Sanjeev and Parveen had wowed the world with her hitting prowess. It was thanks to her explosive batting that India had comfortably sealed their maiden spot in the women’s T20 World Cup final. So it was only fitting that the academy management had made arrangements to air the match on a giant screen at their indoor training facility.

A week back, the academy had closed down before the start of a new season from mid-March.

On Sunday, the academy had opened its doors just for this occasion, so that the trainees could together witness India’s newest superstar, who rose from among them, play the biggest match of her life.

The mood was festive. Even Shafali’s younger sister Nancy, 7, had come with the tricolour painted on her cheeks. Her father Sanjeev was in Melbourne, watching the match live, and Parveen had to handle Nancy all by herself. Shafali’s cousins and aunties had come too. Shafali’s brother Sahil, also a trainee at the academy, sat with his friends. A 100-odd people waited in great anticipation.

The start was ominous. Stationed at short-cover, Shafali dropped Australia opener Healy in the very first over. The ripples were felt 10,000kms away, here at the academy.

“Lena chahiye tha yeh wala. But koi nahi hota hai aisa,” Mohit Rathi, a Haryana U19 player, commented. The others nodded. It was still too early and India was very much in the game.

What unravelled after that reminded one of the 2003 ICC World Cup final where Australia had pulverised the Sourav Ganguly-led India. Healy made full use of the reprieve and went on to make 75 off just 39 balls with seven fours and five sixes. Every time Healy’s lofted shots would send the ball skywards, a collective shout of ‘catch, catch’ would reverberate throughout the facility and would end in a sigh of despair. As Healy and fellow opener Beth Mooney added 100-plus runs for the opening wicket, the excitement somewhat dipped.

“Humhare ladkiya bhi maar sakti hai. Romanchkar match ho sakta hai,” Sanjay Budhwar, a former Haryana player and Shafali’s coach, was not ready to give up so soon.

Finally, the target was set at 185.

The 15 minutes of innings break felt like a long time. There were small huddles among the trainees and everyone had only one question. ‘Can Shafali bring out her best when it matters the most?”

“Shafali can hit just like these Australians,” Divya, a leg-spinner with the Haryana U-19 team, said. “Our prayers are that India should win, in whatever way.”

In came Shafali along with fellow opener Smriti Mandhana, and off she went, stepping out against Megan Schutt for a lofted shot. It missed the boundary by a short distance but the crowd was happy. Shafali was off doing what she does best—clobbering the ball. It did not last long. Two balls later, Shafali was caught behind trying to slice the ball. Silence descended inside the training centre.

As Indian batsmen returned to the pavilion one by one, the same crowd that was cheering vociferously, became stone faced. Shafali’s mother Parveen could not hold back her tears after the final wicket fell.

“Jo meri beti ne kiya, mujhe garv hai. Har ne baad hi jitna seekha jata hai (I’m proud of my daughter. You only learn to win after you lose),” she said.

Ashwani Kumar, the founder of the academy, agreed.

“After India had reached the 2018 T20 World Cup semi-final our academy had seen a surge in girl trainees,” he said. “We are hoping for the same this time too.”"

On the outskirts of Rajkot, at the Saurashtra Cricket Association’s international cricket stadium, Saurashtra and Bengal are locked in training for the Ranji Trophy final starting on Monday. Scheduled over five week days, and clashing with the Holi week, players know they could end up playing in front of empty stands, or school kids brought in for the experience. But it’s not dominating the thoughts within the team led by Jaydev Unadkat or Abhimanyu Easwaran as they face-off hoping the match can swing their fortunes.

“A win in the Ranji final can take players to the next level—the tag of being Ranji champions. We already have bowlers who should be in national contention,” says Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary ahead of his 100th Ranji match. Having faced defeats in the final twice, 2005-06 against Uttar Pradesh and 2006-07 against Mumbai, the 34-year-old is keen to make amends. “Against UP, we lost a very close match. In Mumbai, we were so close and had got them under some pressure. I played a loose shot and got out to Rohit Sharma at point. In this match, there will be value on my wicket. I will try and get a big innings.”

At the other end of the training ground, Saurashtra, the most consistent Ranji outfit, are at the nets. Saurashtra are in their fourth final since 2012-13, searching for their first win.

The centre of attention, Cheteshwar Pujara, has driven to the ground. Some stretching and jogging later, he pads up to face the side-arm—knee bent, all concentration. This is familiar territory for Pujara, after failing the New Zealand examination. After 20 minutes of brushing up the forward defence, he is ready to face the season’s top wicket-taker and Saurashtra skipper, Jaydev Unadkat (65 wickets), in the adjoining nets.

The left-arm paceman, four scalps short of becoming the highest wicket-taker in a Ranji season, steams in. He beats the outside edge of Pujara’s bat. The India Test No. 3, looking to polish his game, takes on the side-arm again, and asks for the ball to shape in. (In New Zealand, he was twice bowled, shouldering arms at Basin Reserve and beaten by a Trent Boult in-swinger in Hamilton).

He is back facing Unadkat, and this time the ball catches the outside edge. Pujara closes the session facing Dharmendra Jadeja’s left-arm-spin. He cools down and gives fielding practice to team-mates.

“Bengal is a good team. Any team that has made the final would have made it thus far by doing well in the league phase and knock-outs. But we have the home advantage,” he said.

In the Bengal nets, bowling coach Ranadeb Bose is asking for more local fast bowlers. The pace trio of Akash Deep, Mukesh Kumar (30 each) and Ishan Porel (22) has 82 wickets this season. Bose wants them all to go full tilt, but not risk bowling long stints. Bengal have done their homework. Aware of the Unadkat threat, they have carried two left-arm pacers to bowl in the nets.

The last time Bengal won the trophy was in 1989-1990, when Sourav Ganguly made his first-class debut. Head coach Arun Lal was a batting mainstay then. ‘Lalji’ has played mentor, helping the team reach this far. “There are bigger players than you who get to play for India but don’t get to play a Ranji final. This is bigger than a Test. So, forget about the result, enjoy these five days,” he has advised his team.

Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha, 35, the other Test player in the final, echoed Lal’s thoughts. “I feel lucky to play a Ranji final. Not everyone gets to play one. Manoj has played in two, I have never played in one. But we are not treating this like a final, it’s just another match.”

Both teams rallied from difficult positions in the semi-finals. Anustup Majumdar struck 149 after Bengal were 67/6 against Karnataka. Saurashtra were reeling at 15/5 against Gujarat before Arpit Vasavada’s 139 and Chirag Jani’s 51 bailed them out. “When Saurashtra were 15/5, in the Indian dressing room (in New Zealand) team-mates would tell me I won’t need to play in the final,” Pujara said. “I would tell them we have the batsmen to come out of it. Fortunately, we managed to do it.”

Although the buzz of a final is missing, there would be needle. Asked about the Pujara factor, Tiwary said: “He is a big player, but we have successfully bowled to him with the ball coming in. So, we will focus on that. Doesn’t matter if he says he is not bothered, that is what we will focus on. Let’s see how it turns out.

“Pujara against our bowlers is what I am looking forward to watching.” With his experience of 16 first-class seasons, Tiwary is sure to be in Pujara’s ear."

Updated: Mar 08, 2020 22:47 IST

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly on Sunday said Australia “outplayed” India in the final of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Melbourne. Unbeaten throughout the tournament, India were beaten by 85 runs by the defending champions, who clinched an unprecedented fifth world title in the shortest format. “Australia played well actually. They outplayed them. In sport there’s always win and loss. But the women’s team have done a great job,” Ganguly said. The former India captain also wished Bengal luck ahead of their Ranji final against Saurashtra.

“I wish them luck. I’m looking forward to it,” said Ganguly who made his first- class debut when the two-time champions last won their title in 1989-90.

The ATK co-owner also said that this is their best team in the Indian Super League even tough they have won two titles in six seasons. The Antonio Habas-coached side scripted a fine turnaround from being 0-2 down on aggregate to post a 3-2 win to storm into their third final.

“We have won the title twice but this is the best ATK team in five (six) years. In this format, 0-1 down doesn’t matter actually. We knew we would win. I’m a huge supporter of Habas, he’s ATK’s man,” Ganguly, who watched the match at the Salt Lake Stadium, said."

Former India captain Jhulan Goswami is certainly disappointed with India’s World T20 final defeat in the hands of Australia but feels that this is not the right time to do a “post-mortem” of the abject surrender. The Meg Lanning-led side put up a dominant show to notch 184/4 and in reply, India meekly surrendered for 84 to miss a third world title in front of a capacity crowd of 86,174. “It’s very disappointing. But don’t forget that they made us proud in this World Cup. But it’s not the time to do a post-mortem. They would be very heartbroken and as Indians we need to stand by them now,” Jhulan told PTI on Sunday.

“I feel very proud for every player in the team. They have done extremely well and made India proud. Remember they had beaten Australia in the group stage,” the legendary pacer said. The 37-year-old Jhulan said that one important aspect that should be taken into account is the age factor.

“Please do remember that India had the youngest team in the World Cup in terms of average age. There were three players aged between 16 to 19 (19-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues, 16 year-olds Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh). They will learn a lot of things and they are the future of Indian cricket,” she said.

India were hugely let down big time by their skipper Harmanpreet, who had a forgettable tournament with 30 runs (2, 8, 1, 15 and 4) from five outings at an average of 6. “In such a tournament, every player has pressure. Maybe, she is going through an inconsistent phase. She didn’t get runs. People talk if you don’t get runs in a big tournament. But we all know what her calibre is. It’s not the right time to talk about her performance.”

Jhulan would rather like to harp on positives rather than picking on Harmanpreet. “It’s time to see how she led the team despite her poor run. She stood there for the players and fought well. She is obviously a good leader and has led the team from the front. They will definitely come out strong.”

India’s newest batting sensation Shafali Verma dropped a regulation catch off Healy, something that proved to be costly for India. “She’s just a 16-year-old girl, who made her debut six months ago and she’s now no 1 ranked player in ICC list. We must back her. And missing catches is a part of the game.”

Bengal youngster Richa Ghosh, who made her debut in the preceding Triseries final against Australia, played two matches in the T20 World Cup and made 18 in the final. “Richa looked very confident. She has a positive intent. I’m really happy for her,” Jhulan hailed. The speedster attributed Australia’s dominating show to their strong grassroots level cricket.

“Australia have much positive cricket. Obviously their grassroots level cricket much ahead of us. We are slowly getting there. These are all part of a learning process.” The final, which coincided with the International Women’s Day, also witnessed the highest attendance for a women’s sporting event in Australia. “It’s a huge achievement for women’s cricket. We must appreciate the Cricket Australia and International Cricket Council,” Jhulan hailed."

Mashrafe stepped down as ODI captain this week after the third and final game of a three-match series against Zimbabwe. He had led the side for more than five years.

“The board has unanimously selected Tamim Iqbal as our new ODI captain,” Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan announced at a press conference after a meeting of the governing body’s board of directors. “We thought of appointing a captain for a short duration and then giving the job to someone else next year. But we finally decided against a short-term appointment. We hope Tamim would serve for a long term,” he added.

Senior India player Smriti Mandhana called for the team to be left alone after its 85-run mauling by Australia in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final on Sunday. Unbeaten throughout the tournament, India were outplayed in all departments of the game by the defending champions, who clinched their fifth world title in the shortest format. “This is a time to introspect. Failure teaches you a lot more than success. The team needs to be left alone and think of how we can be better in the next few years,” Mandhana said after the match.

A sluggish start with the ball and in the field undermined India’s attempts to overhaul the defending champions in their own backyard with the support of a 86,174 crowd at the iconic MCG. Mandhana believed India are a transformed team in the shortest format, and she attributed it to head coach WV Raman.

“T20 was never our best format, one-day was definitely the preferred format. Now we’re playing each format equally well. That is one thing the coach has helped us with and we’ve developed massively,” she said. “The youngsters coming in have totally changed the set-up and the best part of the tournament was it was a complete team performance. That’s one thing Raman has done -- developing us as a team not just one or two players. Today, it didn’t work out but we’ve grown as a team, not just as one or two players.”

Mandhana’s disappointing T20 World Cup -- that saw her manage a top score of 17 in four innings -- continued as India sunk to 99 all out. She also revealed she told a tearful Shafali Verma to be “really proud” of her performances despite a devastating final. Teen sensation Verma was distraught after getting out for two with the bat and drooping Alyssa Healy on nine.

“She has to be really proud of the way she played, but she was upset with the way she got out. She’s thinking already how she can be better. She should be left alone, that’s the most I can tell her.”"

Former Indian cricket team all-rounder Irfan Pathan’s son Imran met legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar during the Road Safety World Series in Mumbai on Saturday. In a video that was posted by Pathan on Instagram, the two of them were seen boxing with each other jokingly after they measured their heights. Pathan posted the video with the caption - “Super hero mode ON????! Imran boxing with @sachintendulkar , this kid has broken the cardinal rule & will realize it only years later!” The 3-year-old looked quite happy in the company of Tendulkar and the veteran was pleasantly surprised at the power of the punches thrown by the kid.

Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag used to torment bowlers in their prime and they did it once again on Saturday, putting the West Indies Legends bowling attack to the sword while adding 83 runs for the first wicket during the opening match of the Road Safety World Series between WI Legends and India Legends.

Sehwag (74 not out; 11x4) played all the shots in the book, including the traditional late cut, while Tendulkar (36;7x4) executed drives, upper cuts and stepped out to spinners, something he did with majestic grace all through his illustrious career.

Tendulkar hammered Suleiman Benn for three successive fours amid the familiar ‘Sachin-Sachin’ chants from the Mumbai crowd.

And as was the case earlier, the legend’s dismissal brought about ‘pin drop’ silence in the stadium.

After Mohammed Kaif (14) and Manpreet Gony (0) fell, Sehwag, in the company of Yuvraj Singh (10 not out), chased the 151-run target as the hosts won by 7 wickets.

Earlier, India Legends restricted WI Legends to 150/8 with pacers Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbing two wickets.

Opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 61 (6x4; 2x6).

Wriddhiman Saha is confident that Bengal’s unheralded bunch of bowlers have seen enough of Cheteshwar Pujara on television to plot his dismissal when they take on Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy final.

This is the first time in his 13-year-old first-class career that Saha will be playing a national final and Akash Deep, Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Porel will only benefit from his advice on how dismiss Pujara on a track wher he has played some of his marathon innings.

“Whoever fights till the end will win. They (Bengal teammates) all watch international matches. They know how to get Pujara out,” Saha was reticent as usual bit surely put across a point.

His dear friend Ashoke Dinda was dropped from the squad for disciplinary reasons but what Saha finds heartening is how the young trio of Ishan, Akash and Mukesh have more than fulfilled the veteran pacer’s void.

“Earlier, the past teams reached the knock-outs on the basis of performance of a few players. For example, Ashok Dinda used to take (bulk of) wickets without much support from the other end, the team was stuck in a way. Now everyone is contributing,” Saha said.

“The bowlers are also contributing with the bat. Match-wining performances have come in the batting department. There is good camaraderie too which helps,” the veteran of 102 first-class games said.

On a personal front, Saha is excited that he along with nine others will play their first final.

“First time, I am getting to play the final and it doesn’t happen regularly. In our team, only Manoj (Tiwary) has had experience (2005-06 and 2006-07). Shami and I were tracking the team’s performance from New Zealand. “Other India players were also keen to know,” said the man, who was benched for the two Tests, a subject he didn’t touch during his interaction with media,” said Saha.

A teamman to the core, Saha who recently became father for the second time didn’t pay heed to his wife Romi’s request of joining the team a day later.

“My wife said “go a day later to Rajkot but I said I have to go two days before as it is an important match. She did not say much now but I am sure she will have plenty to say later,” he chuckled."

India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Sunday said she has full faith in her team to do well in future even after Australia outclassed her side by 85 runs in the summit clash of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here.

Unbeaten throughout the tournament, India were outplayed in all departments of the game by the defending champions Australia who clinched their fifth title.

“The way we played in the league games was outstanding. I still have a lot of faith in my team,” Harmanpreet said after the match.

“It’s part of the game, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. You have to keep learning. But I trust this team,” she added.Kaur, however, rued the dropped chances of Australia openers Beth Mooney (78 not out) and Alyssa Healy (75), who set up their team’s victory. She said that the team needs to work in the fielding department and learn from the mistakes.”Today, it was unfortunate that we dropped those catches. The upcoming one-and-a-half years is very important. We need to focus, especially in fielding,” she said.

Playing in their maiden final, India wilted under pressure as they were bowled out for 99 in 19.1 overs while chasing 185 for a win, and Kaur reckoned her side need to learn how to win high-stakes clashes.

“If we talk about the last T20 World Cup, we got to the semis, and this time to the final. I think we’re on the right path. Every year we are improving. We just need to think of how we play with focus in the main games. Sometimes we don’t manage that,” the skipper said.

She spoke highly of the domestic IPL style Women’s Challenger tournament, saying that the event has helped spot talented players for the national team.

“This year we are hoping for some more games in the Women’s Challenger, that tournament is very important for us because it is high quality. From there we already got two good players, and hopefully in the upcoming tournaments we can get more.”Australia captain Meg Lanning was delighted by her team’s performance throughout the tournament.

“I’m just really proud of this group of players and staff. We’ve had everything thrown at us, ups and downs. It was tough, definitely, especially after we lost that first game. There was a lot of expectation on us, inside and out. Definitely some tough times in there but we stuck with each other, had each other’s backs,” she said.

Australia were dealt with major blows when star all-rounder Ellyse Perry and pacer Tayla Vlaeminck were ruled out of the tournament and Lanning said the absence of the duo affected the team’s plans.

“Coming in they (the injured players) were a big part of our plans, we had to go to Plan B and C.”Talking about the record turnout of 86174 at the iconic MCG, the most in a women’s cricket match, she said, “It has been massive, 86000 people at the MCG, I’ve never seen it before and didn’t think I’d be part of it in the middle.”Player of the tournament Beth Mooney, who scored a scintillating unbeaten 78, said her team was aware of their shortcomings from their group stage loss against India and worked on executing their plans properly.

“I’m a bit lost for words. It has been an unbelievable tournament. The crowds have been great throughout the tournament,” Mooney said.

“Didn’t really do anything differently. We had some plans we didn’t execute in that first game. I think we stuck to our processes. We sort of knew what went wrong against India in the first game and we worked on our plans accordingly,” she added."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 08, 2020 17:43 IST

Harmanpreet Kaur said that Shafali Verma struggled to bounce back after dropping Alyssa Healy but refused to blame the teenager for defeat in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final.

India, playing in their first Women’s T20 World Cup Final, had no answer to Alyssa Healy (75) and Beth Mooney (78 not out) before folding to 99 all out at the hands of seamer Megan Schutt and spinner Jess Jonassen.

Shafali, who ends with the highest strike rate of any batter to face more than 50 balls at the event, dropped Healy on nine in the first over and only made two in the reply.

But this setback will only serve as a learning experience in the eyes of the India captain.

“She’s only 16, she’s playing her first World Cup. She did really, really well and performed for us,” said Kaur. “For a 16-year-old kid, it’s difficult to keep thinking positively and stay in the game.

“It’s a learning lesson for her but it could happen to anyone. We can’t blame her because there were others also in her position.

“We gave chances to batters in great form and it’s difficult for bowlers to come back when that happens.

“We weren’t feeling under pressure but unfortunately we were unable to create those chances.

“It’s a lesson for all of us, we have to be at 100 per cent when we’re fielding because that’s the most important part of cricket.”

India came into the tournament with one of its youngest squads, and became the first team to field more than one teenager in the tournament’s Final.

It’s a youthful energy that bodes well for the future for Kaur’s side, with plenty of new faces since their ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 defeat to England.

On that occasion, just nine runs separated India from the title - with the lack of clinical cricket this time around making defeat slightly easier to swallow for the skipper.

“I guess 2017 was more disappointing, because that was so close,” she added. “We didn’t play the cricket we expected of ourselves this time.

“As our team is quite young, we did really well in the league games. We reached the semis and the Final this year. If we keep working and improving, maybe in the future we can win.

“There was still excitement. It was a great day, we definitely enjoyed it. Winning and losing is part of the game, one team has to do both. At the end of the day, it was a great moment for us.

“We didn’t field well, we need to learn from today’s performance. When you are playing a great level of cricket, you cannot drop the chances and we were not up to the mark.

“We will take this seriously and when we come to play next time, we will be one of the best fielding sides.”"

The Indian women’s cricket team were thrashed by Australia in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Australian women’s cricket team won the final by 85 runs as the Indian batters failed to fire at a crucial stage. Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney ran riot at the start of the first innings as Australia gave India a stiff target of 185 runs. So naturally, a lot depended on India’s star batter Shafali Verma.

The 16-year-old was in tremendous form throughout the World Cup and fans expected another onslaught from her in the final. But it wasn’t to be as Shafali lost her wicket for just 2 runs and went back to the pavilion in the first over itself. It turned out that Shafali’s performance was imperative in the final as Harmanpreet Kaur and Co could only manage 99 runs at the MCG.

Shafali on Sunday broke a world record even before the first ball of India vs Australia Women’s T20 World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. At 16 years and 40 days, Shafali Verma became the youngest cricketer to feature in any World Cup final (including men’s cricket).

The Melbourne Cricket Ground was buzzing, Kate Perry was performing live, the teams walked out, screamed out their national anthems, the crowd was lapping it all up. Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney walked out to take guard, Harmanpreet handed the ball to Deepti Sharma. Yes, the build-up was huge, the expectations were massive, but now it was time to perform.

The first ball was a full bunger, Healy raced down the track and smacked it wide of long-on. A boundary to get things rolling and Australia wanted to dictate terms. Another boundary followed, a catch was dropped in that over, India were struggling to make their presence felt.

The template was set, for both sides, Rajeshwari dropped Beth Mooney and right at this moment, Healy dropped the hammer and took proceedings in her own hands. She was on the charge, attacked the spinners, smashed the pacers and Australia had gained early ascendancy in the grand final.

India kept fumbling, Healy kept caning them, she was in no mood to relent and cranked it up a notch after reaching her 50. Beth Mooney, on the other hand, was slowly turning the strike over, she had got her eye in and now, even she was climbing all over the Indian bowlers. Along the way, Healy was dropped again, she winked, danced and continued smoking the bowlers. She was finally dismissed for 75, but the 115 runs opening stand had put Australia on course.

The chase which never got going

184 runs were always going to be a steep mountain to climb for India and these brought back memories of the 2017 ODI world cup when after the build-up and expectations, when after the majority of the match was dominated by Mithali Raj and team, the final few overs shut the door on the side. They were chasing down 228 and were cruising along at 191 for 3 when they collapsed. When the carnage ended at Lord’s, India were bowled out for 219. A defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory.

In many ways, this match today at MCG was mirror image of what happened in Lord’s.

It was a huge day for women’s cricket, it was the day when Indian cricket could have taken a decisive step, it could well have taken, but the way the side reacted to pressure was something which will leave no one impressed.

The chase began, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana walked out - Shafali walked back, Taniya Bhatia came in, she walked back too, Jemimah came in, took guard, hit one straight to mid-on. The crowd had not even blinked, India were 2 down and one player was retired. Mandhana stroked a couple of boundaries and then she hit one down the throat of mid-off. India were three down and Nasser Hussain exclaimed in the commentary box ‘ India are crumbling’ and crumble they did. It was a final between the two best sides of the tournament, but unfortunately only one arrived, the other one was swept away by the sheer amount of pressure and the enormity of the occasion. The side was brilliant all through the tournament, but come the big night, they blinked, stuttered and slipped!

Women’s cricket is on the upward curve, Indian team is leading this charge, but the side has to learn ways and means to cope up with pressure a lot better. On the day when it mattered the most, Australia won the big moments and India allowed them to slip by - in many ways, this match reflected how India need to react when the pressure is amped.

It was the last ball of the 13th over, Richa Ghosh met the ball with a full face of the bat, timed it over covers, the ball was racing towards the boundary ropes. The fielder sprinted across, stuck out her left hand and saved a certain boundary.

“There, in a nutshell, is what has happened in the match. Australia have been brilliant, India were weak in the field,” Harsha Bhogle said during commentary.

There were tears in the Indian dugout, there was an outpour of emotions, the biggest match of their lives turned out to be a nightmare. However, this Indian team has age on their side, and this Indian team has pedigree. The ensured they forced people to talk about them, now they have to ensure they start winning titles!

“The way we played in the league stages, it was outstanding. It was unfortunate to drop those catches today. Upcoming 1.5 years is important. The future is good for us, we need to trust ourselves. You have to keep learning. The first game was very good, it gave us a lot of confidence. We spent a lot of time together, unfortunate for us not to win today. We have to keep working hard. We are in the right line, every year we are improving. We need to play with more focus. Sometimes, we are not able to give our best,” captain Harmanpreet Kaur said after the match and she could not have been more accurate in her assessment."

There was massive excitement and buzz for the T20 World Cup final between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Two of the biggest cricketing nations were taking on each other in the final of the World Cup and fans cued up to catch the action live at the stadium. The enthusiasm was such that the attendance record was broken in the final for a women’s cricket match.

ICC announced that 86,174 people attended the India vs Australia final at the MCG. This is a record for a women’s sporting event in Australia while also becoming the most attended women’s cricket match in the history of the sport.

A lot was expected from the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side but as fate would have it, the India women’s cricket team perhaps reserved their worst performance of the Women’s T20 World Cup for the final. They were outplayed in all three departments, to say the least as hosts Australia won their fifth T20 World Cup title after beating India by a whopping 85 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

The gap between the two sides was so big that the win predictor never climbed up to more than 20% in India’s favour in the entire duration of the final.

There was a big build-up, there was huge anticipation and then there was an anti-climax.

This was the second final in a little over 2 years that the Indian Women’s Team lost. They had lost the ODI World Cup final to England in 2017 after being in command for the major part of the final.

India never arrived on Sunday, they were never in the game. More than the result what would hurt India more is the manner in which they were outplayed despite reaching the finals as the unbeaten side.

After conceding 184 on a pitch that had some assistance for the spinners, the batters pretty much put on a no show. Shafali Verma was dismissed on the third ball of the chase. India’s hopes were all but dashed when Jemimah Rodrigues and Smriti Mandhana too followed quickly and they were reduced to 18 for 3 in 3.1 overs.

In between wicket-keeper Taniya Bhaita, who came in to bat at No.3, had to retire hurt after being hit on the helmet.

The slide continued when captain Harmanpreet Kaur’s horrific World Cup ended with a 4-run innings in the final.

India never recovered from the early jolts. Deepti Sharma (33) and Veda Krishnamurthy (19) provided some resistance but that was like fighting with a knife in front of machine guns.

Taniya did not come out to bat due to concussion and Richa Ghosh came in place of her as concussion substitute.

Megan Schutt was the star with the ball for Australia. After not having the greatest of World Cups till the semi-finals, she stood up when it mattered the most. Schutt returned with 4 for 18 in her 3.1 overs and also took the last Indian wicket to seal the final.

Schutt was ably supported by left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen, who finished with 3 for 18.

Earlier, Beth Mooney and Alyssa Healy’s 115-run opening stand laid the platform for a big total for Australia.

Healy broke the record for registering the fastest fifty in the history of ICC event finals. Healy (75) was finally sent back to the pavilion in the 12th over as she was sent back to the pavilion by Radha Yadav.

Skipper Meg Lanning then joined Mooney in the middle and both batters did not let momentum slide for Australia. The duo registered 39 runs together, but in trying to score boundaries, Lanning (16) and Ashleigh Gardner (0) perished in the 17th over, reducing Australia to 156/3.

In the final two overs, Mooney managed to register boundaries to take Australia’s score past the 180-run mark in the allotted twenty overs. For Australia, Mooney and Nicola Carey remained unbeaten on 78 and 5 respectively. For India, Deepti Sharma scalped two wickets."

Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan, medium pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, all-rounder Hardik Pandya returned to the India ODI squad for three-match series against South Africa starting from March 12. Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar and Pandya proved their fitness in the recently-concluded Dy Patil T20 Cup. Meanwhile, KL Rahul, who was excellent in the limited-overs series against New Zealand, but not included in the Test squad, has also been included in the squad.

Limited-overs vice captain Rohit Sharma was rested from the series. He had suffered a calf injury which had ruled him out of the New Zealand Test series. But with youngster Prithvi Shaw in the 15-man squad, it will once again be a three-way contest for the openers slot between Shaw, Dhawan and Rahul.

Though, India persisted with Rahul as the wicketkeeper in the New Zealand series, Rishabh Pant has been included in the squad. It remains to be seen if India go with Rahul or Pant in the playing XI in the series.

This is the first series in which all-rounder Pandya has been included in since his back surgery in October. Post his surgery, Pandya had initially hired the services of Delhi Capitals trainer Rajnikanth Sivagnanam to undergo rehab with Team India physio Yogesh Parmar keeping an eye on Pandya’s progress post his back surgery in October.

But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly made it clear that all players must report to the NCA to undergo rehab.

The Indian team management then convinced Pandya to head to the NCA when he trained with the players at the Wankhede Stadium before the ODI against Australia. Having completed the process, he returned to the field in the ongoing T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai and has already hit two hundreds.

Speaking on his fitness, Pandya said: “For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”

The first ODI will be played on March 12 in Dharamshala and the second on March 15 in Lucknow. The final match will be played in Kolkata on March 18.

West Indies Twenty20 captain Kieron Pollard has been ruled out of the Pakistan Super League due to a niggle in his right thigh, with Carlos Brathwaite replacing the allrounder at Peshawar Zalmi for the remainder of the tournament.

Pollard was expected to join Peshawar after West Indies tour of Sri Lanka but the West Indies allrounder’s injury means he won’t play this year’s tournament .

Brathwaite was originally called-up as cover for Pollard till March 6, with that arrangement now being extended for the duration of the tournament.

“I’m sorry I can’t be there in person this year, but the team has some inspirational characters leading the charge and I’m sure can give Daren (Sammy) his first trophy as a head coach,”Pollard said in a statement.

Peshawar, with nine points, is joint leader with Multan Sultans in the six-team event and will play its remaining two league matches against Lahore Qalandars and against Multan next week.

The top four teams will qualify for the playoffs and the final of the tournament will be played at Lahore on March 22."

Australia openers Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney got off to flying start after Australia captain Meg Lanning won the toss and decided to bat first in the Women’s T20 World Cup final against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. Healy and Mooney put on a 115-run opening stand as Australia finished with 184 for 4 batting first. Healy smashed 75 off just 39 balls while Mooney remained with 78. But both the Australian openers were helped by the Indian fiddlers. The Indian women’s team fielders were all nerves as they dropped both Healy and Mooney inside the powerplay which cost India 136 runs (Considering only the individual runs). Healy was batting on 9 and Mooney was on 8.

Australia wicket-keeper and opener Healy had come out intending to take the attack to the Indian spinners right from the word go. She made her intentions clear by charging down the track to hit Deepti Sharma for a boundary past long-on in the first ball of the T20 World Cup final.

Healy hit another boundary, this time on the backfoot in the fourth ball. But the Australian took another chance and did not get all of it. She spooned it cover, where Shafali Verma was stationed but the teenager dropped the catch.

Healy made full use of the dropped chance and continued on her merry way and hit three more boundaries in her next four deliveries.

In the fourth over of the Australia innings, Beth Mooney was dropped. Left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad failed to hold on to a low return catch.

Thanks to the reprieves The Australian openers brought up their fifty in 6.1 overs.

Apart from the two drop catches, there were at least two instances when the fielders in the inner-ring let the ball slip away from their grasp.

After the powerplay, Healy started to attack more as the lacklustre bowling from India’s bowlers continued. She hit Gayakwad for 16 runs in an over including two sixes in the 8th over. She got to her fifty in just 30 balls.

Healy took her assault to a different level by hitting a hat-trick of sixes off Shikha Pandey in the 11th over. There were no answers from the Indian bowlers. They erred both on length and line.

The Australia keeper was dismissed by Radha Yadav in the 12th over but by then the damage was already done. Healy, who was dropped on 8 went on to score 75 off 39 balls. And the opening partnership of Australia read 115.

While Healy was going all guns blazing, Mooney at the other end was doing no mean job by not only giving Healy good company but also going after the Indian spinners.

Mooney batted through the innings and remained unbeaten on 78."

Updated: Mar 08, 2020 14:27 IST

Saurashtra, led by the inspirational Jaydev Unadkat, will back themselves to win an elusive Ranji Trophy title at home but a buoyant Bengal will be no pushovers in what promises to be an absorbing final beginning on Monday.

Both the teams are desperate to go all the way with Saurashtra reaching their fourth final in eight seasons while Bengal has not tasted success in the premier domestic event since the 1989-90 triumph.

While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest at the SCA Stadium, which is also the venue for the final.

There will also be star power on display with Test regulars Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha joining the Saurashtra and Bengal squads respectively, having returned from New Zealand.

In fact, Pujara was very much Saurasthra’s 12th man with Unadkat being in constant touch with his senior teammate during the hard-fought semifinal. Now his physical presence in the all-important game will be a big boost to the side.

READ: India’s Shafali Verma breaks world record in T20 WC final

Saurashtra would not have ended up on the right side of the result against Gujarat if it wasn’t for Unadkat, who has had a sensational run this season with 65 wickets at an average of 12.17 and is three shy of the all-time record of 68 scalps, set by Bihar spinner Ashutosh Aman last season.

The left-arm pacer single-handedly led his team to victory on day five earlier this week with a seven-wicket haul on a flat surface, including the scalps of a set Parthiv Patel and Chiragh Gandhi, who had brought Gujarat back in the game from a hopeless 63 for five while chasing 327.

Unadkat’s stellar performances over the course of the season has put him back in national reckoning but in his own words, they would count for little if the team doesn’t go all the way.

Not just with the ball, he also inspired with his captaincy and one example of that was when he promoted number 11 Chetan Sakariya, who shared a crucial 90-run stand with Arpit Vasavada (139) after the hosts collapsed to 15 for five.

The skipper is leading from the front but will expect more from his fellow pacers who have not done much to write home about this season.

Besides Pujara, the team’s leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson will be expected to shoulder the batting responsibilities.

Saurashtra will be wary of Bengal’s potent pace attack which fashioned their comprehensive win over eight-time champions Karnataka.

The pace trio of Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep were on fire in the semifinal and has contributed significantly to the team’s overall success.

Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed has come of age this season and is the team’s joint highest wicket-taker with 30 scalps alongside Kumar and Akash Deep.

The onus in the batting department lies on veteran Manoj Tiwary, who has been the team’s leading run-getter with 672 runs from 10 games but has not fired after his couple of match-winning half-centuries on a challenging track in Patiala.

The role of head coach Arun Lal also cannot be overlooked in Bengal’s first final appearance after 13 years."

Hopes are high for the Indian team to bring their first world title back home. However,things didn’t go as planned for Harmanpreet Kaur and Co after a stupendous start by the defending champions.

Alyssa Healy scored 75 runs off 39 balls while Beth Mooney hit a fifty as Australia made a great start to the T20 World Cup final.

At 41, Zaheer Khan is not at the peak of fitness but the former India fast bowler turned back the clock during the Road Safety World Series opener between India Legends and West Indies legends at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai as he took a stunning catch to dismiss Ricardo Powell. In an attempt to score quickly, Powell played a lofted shot towards deep square leg but Zaheer was present at the right position.

Sachin Tendulkar was extremely impressed with the effort and during the post match presentation, he said that he has seen Zaheer feel like this.

India Legends secured a massive seven-wicket victory against West Indies Legends. Chasing 151, India Legends witnessed a stunning start with openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag playing brilliantly.

In men’s cricket, the record belongs to Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir. He was 17 years and 69 days old when Pakistan played the T20 World Cup final against Australia in 2009.

Youngest player to feature in a cricket World Cup final:

Shafali Verma is slated to open the batting for India women with Smriti Mandhana in the big final against Australia Women on Sunday. But she will have to wait for her chance to bat as Australia captain Mag Lanning won the toss and opted to bat first.

Shafali has been in tremendous form in this T20 World Cup. With 167 runs in only 4 matches, she is India’s leading run-scorer. Her blitz in the current Women’s T20 World Cup made her the youngest to attain the No. 1 spot in the ICC rankings for batters in T20Is.

Verma was one of India’s key weapons even in the group stage encounter against Australia. She hit Australia’s premier fast bowler Megan Chutt for 16 runs in an over to gave India flying start. India had ended on the winning side in that match.

“I just hate playing India - they’ve got the wood over me,” Megan Schutt was quoted as saying by the official ICC website ahead of the IND W vs AUS W World Cup final. “Smriti and Shefali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I’ve ever been hit for,” she said."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 09:20 IST

There was Sachin Tendulkar, there was Virender Sehwag, there was Brian Lara and a stadium full of nostalgia during the India legends vs West Indies legends match in Road Safety World Series at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The Tendulkars, Sehwags, Zaheers and Laras rolled the clock backwards by producing a spectacle on Saturday evening. And in that spectacle, the Indian legends shown brighter as they emerged victorious thanks to a blistering opening stand between Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.

Right from the moment the Sachin-Sehwag opening combination made their way into the centre - climbing down the stairs and slowly strolling their way into the lush green Wankhede outfield - the familiar ‘Sachin-Sachin’ chants engulfed Mumbai and it continued till the time the little master was at the crease.

Like old times, amid the Sachin-frenzy, Sehwag made everyone took notice by smacking the first two balls of the India legends to the boundary.

Sehwag (74 not out; 11x4) played all the shots in the book, including the traditional late cut, while Tendulkar (36;7x4) executed drives, upper cuts and stepped out to spinners, something he did with majestic grace all through his illustrious career.

Tendulkar hammered Suleiman Benn for three successive fours to light the stadium.

And as was the case earlier, the legend’s dismissal brought about ‘pin drop’ silence in the stadium.

After Mohammed Kaif (14) and Manpreet Gony (0) fell, Sehwag, in the company of Yuvraj Singh (10 not out), chased the 151-run target as the hosts won by 7 wickets.

Earlier, India Legends restricted WI Legends to 150/8 with pacers Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbing two wickets.

Opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 61 (6x4; 2x6).

Brian Lara (17; 4x4), in his brief stay at the crease, showed the crowd why he is considered among the finest to have ever wielded the willow.

Zaheer’s one-handed stunner was also one of the talking points of the day.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Even as he gears up for the much awaited project, Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is all set for yet another release soon. Dimple Kapadia, Deepak Dobriyal, Kareena Kapoor and Radhika Madaan also feature in Angrezi Medium.

A Mid Day report said that Apno Se Bewafai, which has been awaiting release for past two years, will now hit theatres on April 2. The film’s director [Prakash Bhalekar told the tabloid, “It is a family entertainer with Irrfan as the lead. He has done an excellent job in the movie. The supporting cast is made up of new actors. We completed the film before Irrfan’s health deteriorated, but the release was pushed due to lack of funds.”

However, the director is yet to inform Irrfan. “We are not in touch as Irrfan is not talking to anybody right now.”

About making Angrezi Medium with Irrfan and delaying the film, because of the actor’s availability, Homi recently told Hindustan Times. “While the making of the movie, Irrfan was undergoing treatment, so there would be good days and bad days. There was an uncertainty about his energy levels, considering how difficult shoots can be. I did put everything on hold and decided to wait for him to make this. Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan, producer) and I were very clear that Angrezi Medium would be made with Irrfan only. And I took the risk, knowing that it would be an experience that my crew and I would cherish.”

While Kareena plays a cop in the film, Dimple essays the role of her mother. Irrfan plays dad to a teenager, played by Radhika. Angrezi Medium hits theatres on March 13 and trade pundits expect an impressive opening for the film. As per trade analyst Girish Johar, the film may make an opening collection of Rs 4 crore.

Pakistan-origin actor-comedian Kumail Nanjiani says he wanted to look like Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan in Marvel's upcoming epic film The Eternals. In The Eternals, Nanjiani will play Kingo, a cosmic being living on Earth. His secret identity would be of a big Bollywood star.

Nanjiani stunned the world when he unveiled his body transformation in 2019 for The Eternals. Now, he has revealed that Hrithik was a big inspiration in his fitness journey.

In Men's Health's April cover story, the actor said that he wanted Kingo to be Bollywood Bruce Willis and Marvel's John McClane. ""I was like, 'How can a character crack wise but still have tension, and not make it fee; like you're making fun of the whole thing?'"" Nanjiani said.

This time, he had a Bollywood inspiration. ""I went to my trainer and said, 'I want to look like this guy',"" said Nanjiani. ""This guy"" was Hrithik.

I got to be on the cover of @MensHealthMag and recreate scenes from some of my favorite action movies. Pics by @EmilyShur, story by @BrianRaftery here: https://t.co/u0q29AlXEw pic.twitter.com/W8bnZagC2f — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 10, 2020

The physical transformation wasn't easy. Nanjiani struggled with body dysmorphia after a new diet and exercise regime gave him an entirely new physique. ""I don't want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don't have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I'd look in the mirror and I'd see my abs - and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,"" he said.

However, once he went public with his new body, Nanjiani found it really helpful to see the reaction from his fans on social media. ""When I saw that reaction was when I was like, 'Okay, I clearly don't see what's actually there. It's something I'm trying to be aware of and be better at, because that's not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,"" he said.

Director Chloe Zhao will be bringing the world of Jack Kirby-created comic, which debuted in July 1976, alive. It is about super-powered beings The Celestials and their villainous adversaries The Deviants in a war set millions of years ago.

The Eternals also features Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan. The movie is scheduled to release in November.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

There was Sachin Tendulkar, there was Virender Sehwag, there was Brian Lara and a stadium full of nostalgia during the India legends vs West Indies legends match in Road Safety World Series at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The Tendulkars, Sehwags, Zaheers and Laras rolled the clock backwards by producing a spectacle on Saturday evening. And in that spectacle, the Indian legends shown brighter as they emerged victorious thanks to a blistering opening stand between Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.

Right from the moment the Sachin-Sehwag opening combination made their way into the centre - climbing down the stairs and slowly strolling their way into the lush green Wankhede outfield - the familiar ‘Sachin-Sachin’ chants engulfed Mumbai and it continued till the time the little master was at the crease.

Like old times, amid the Sachin-frenzy, Sehwag made everyone took notice by smacking the first two balls of the India legends to the boundary.

Sehwag (74 not out; 11x4) played all the shots in the book, including the traditional late cut, while Tendulkar (36;7x4) executed drives, upper cuts and stepped out to spinners, something he did with majestic grace all through his illustrious career.

Tendulkar hammered Suleiman Benn for three successive fours to light the stadium.

And as was the case earlier, the legend’s dismissal brought about ‘pin drop’ silence in the stadium.

After Mohammed Kaif (14) and Manpreet Gony (0) fell, Sehwag, in the company of Yuvraj Singh (10 not out), chased the 151-run target as the hosts won by 7 wickets.

Earlier, India Legends restricted WI Legends to 150/8 with pacers Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel and spinner Pragyan Ojha grabbing two wickets.

Opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul made 61 (6x4; 2x6).

Brian Lara (17; 4x4), in his brief stay at the crease, showed the crowd why he is considered among the finest to have ever wielded the willow.

Zaheer’s one-handed stunner was also one of the talking points of the day.

I do not know about the whereabouts of my bat, I cannot say that it has been stolen,” the spinner told ANI.

The player said despite opting for extra baggage, the airline asked for extra money which the cricketer refused.”But my kit bag was not opened after practice, we had opted for the 35kg extra baggage package. At the airport, the authorities told me that we are having extra baggage and they asked us for extra 1200 rupees, but my team did not pay the amount as we had already opted for extra baggage package,” Harbhajan said.

I have complained to the authorities as the bat is important. Indigo guys have told me that they would look into the matter, I hope they will do the needful,” he added.

Indigo Airlines replied to the cricketer, apologising for the inconvenience. “Sorry to know about this, Mr. Singh. Let us get this checked immediately and connect with you.”

Meg Lanning will be a proud leader, she has led the side with aplomb, MCG rises as one as the Australian team have reigned supreme.

Australia have won the toss and they will bat first. Beth Mooney and Alyssa Healy rode on dropped chances to smash blistering fifties and power Australia to a challenging 184 for four against India.

T20 women’s world cup FINAL, India vs Australia as it happened:

16:11 hrs: Lanning now receives the trophy from Belinda Clark. Shouts of ‘yaaays’ from the Southern Stars echoes all over. Now, they pose in front of the CHAMPIONS hoarding and CHAMPIONS they are!

16:10 hrs: Meg Lanning speaks - I’m just proud of this group. We have had ups and downs. To put this kind of performance on the biggest day is outstanding. There was a lot of expectations from us. We were hoping to be there. To get here was a significant achievement. We had to change our tactics quickly, had to execute on the big stage. I knew she’s (Schutt) going to perform well. I’d like to thank all the support staff, to family and friends. And, also to the fans, I’m happy to play in front of you.

16:02 hrs: Harmanpreet Kaur speaks - The way we played in the league stages, it was outstanding. It was unfortunate to drop those catches today. Upcoming 1.5 years is important. The future is good for us, we need to trust ourselves. You have to keep learning. The first game was very good, it gave us a lot of confidence. We spent a lot of time together, unfortunate for us not to win today. We have to keep working hard. We are in the right line, every year we are improving. We need to play with more focus. Sometimes, we are not able to give our best. This year we are hoping for some more games in the Women’s T20 Challenge. That tournament is very important. Hopefully, we do get more players.

15:46 hrs: Reactions coming in:

The Indian players collect their respective runners-up medals. They are being cheered by the crowd.

Beth Mooney, Player of the Tournament - I’m a bit lost for words. It’s been an unbelievable tournament. The crowds have been great throughout the tournament. [Playing spin] Didn’t really do anything differently. We had some plans that we didn’t execute in that first game [against India]. I’m just very fortunate and grateful to be given the opportunities I’ve been given by Cricket Australia.

Alyssa Healy - has been adjudged the Player of the Match. It was unbelievable, thank you everyone. You can’t wipe off the smile out of my face, even if we lot the game. It’s the nature of how I play, just needed a little bit of luck. Just went out there and enjoyed my time. Mooney is sensational. She got off strike and let me do my thing. We are having a lot of fun together.

Megan Schutt: I am absolutely overwhelmed, the atmosphere couldn’t have been any better. I was excited and ready to go, been waiting for this since a long time. They came out with so much confidence, the openers. We all are happy to be here and be a part of this event. We just want to enjoy every moment.

Jess Jonassen: Feels absolutely incredible at the moment. How good was that (the Mexican wave). We had a massive 12 months leading to this and we didn’t have the smoothest of the tournaments, but we had our best game today.

Ashleigh Gardner: Having a home crowd was amazing. It’s an honour to play for my country and represent my culture as well. I never thought I’d play in front of 86000 people. It was incredible to see the Mexican wave.

15:21 hrs: Deepti has to walk back - Australia have been on fire all day and they continue to dominate proceedings. Another superb catch on the boundary ropes sends back Deepti Sharma.

15:17 hrs: It is meandering along at the moment - Australia should wrap this up, and India will be massively disappointed with their performance. No one really stood up and made their presence felt.

15:07 hrs: Richa Ghosh has walked out as a concussion substitute for Taniya Bhatia and she is looking good in her brief stay.

15:01 hrs: 5th wicket falls - Veda tried to go over the top, but like the top order and has been taken by Jonassen. Australia have been on fire all day!

14:52 hrs: The asking rate is climbing all the time - Both Veda and Deepti are trying to stabilise this rocking ship but well, the asking rate is climbing all the time. This is getting beyond India’s reach!

14:30 hrs: Smriti departs - She wanted to go over the fielder at mid off, there is no timing at all and she has to take the long walk back. India are in tatters and there is no respite.

14:23 hrs: Rodrigues departs - She comes down the track, tries to go downtown, but is caught at mid on. Shocking start for India.

14:21 hrs: Taniya comes in and walks out,she has retired hurt. She went down to sweep, but the ball bounced more and hit her on the grille.

14:13 hrs: Shafali dismissed: Now, this can be a sucker punch. Shafali has edged on to Alyssa Healy and she has to walk back in the very first over. India could not have got off to a worse start.

13:56 hrs: Australia end with 184/4 - This has been a sensational innings, the openers set the tone and India were erratic, they were very indisciplined in the field in the powerplay and both Beth Mooney and Alyssa Healy took control and they smashed the bowlers all over the park.

13:50 hrs: Mooney is motoring along but Poonam Yadav gets rid of Rachel Haynes. Australia will not care, they will keep going after the bowlers.

13:43 hrs: Gardner is stumped and India get two wickets in one over. Can India pull things back here. Australia are already on course here!

13: 30 hrs: Mooney is now on the charge - Lanning has the license but Mooney is now on the charge. There is no respite here for India. They need to keep picking up wickets. Australia are looking good to race past 200.

13:19 hrs: The assault comes to an end - Healy comes down the track, she wants to keep going, but for a change, does not get the right timing and is caught at long on. But what an innings it has been, it has put Australia on course. Can India do something after this break?

13:17 hrs: Healy is creaming it - 23 runs off that over, this is stunning hitting and India are absolutely shell-shocked. They have absolutely no answer to this innings.

13:08 hrs: Healy has raced to a 50 - Wow, this has been some innings, she was dropped early and she had ensured India pay dearly for this miss. Healy has absolutely sprinted to her 50 and India are under immense pressure.

13:02 hrs: Healy is taking India to the cleaners - 2 massive sixes in that over and Australia are back on track. Australia are really dominating proceedings here, India need a wicket, they need it right now!

12:58 hrs: Good two overs for India - Rajeshwari and Poonam have given away 7 runs off the last two overs and slowly, India have found something to cling on to. They have pick up a wicket, the openers have given Australia a superb platform.

12:51 hrs: Australia have zoomed ahead - India are not helping themselves there. Already a couple of dropped catches and a couple of misfields. Both Mooney and Healy have taken off and Australia are bossing proceedings here.

12:44 hrs: More spin employed - Rajeshwari into the attack, Harmanpreet needs to exert some control. Mooney, however, is having nothing to do with it, comes down the track and lofts it over covers for another boundary. Australia are racing along.

12:40 hrs: Healy has taken to the Indian bowlers - She has come out flying and the wicket-keeper batsman is absolutely smoking them at the moment. It is a high risk approach, but Australia have flown to 23 after the first 2 overs.

12:35 hrs: 14 runs off that over. Alyssa Healy has come out all guns blazing, 3 boundaries in that over and Shafali also dropped a rather straight forward chance. India seem to be under more pressure!

12:33 hrs: Deepti Sharma takes the ball and the first three balls have all been full tosses. Healy smacked the first one for four. The fourth ball has been guided past short third man and point. 2 boundaries already and Australia are off and running!

12:29 hrs: Healy and Mooney walk out. They have been a terrific opening combination for Australia. India need to strike early and separate this pair. The crowd is roaring!

12:24 hrs: Time for the National Anthems - The G rises as one, this is one huge day for Women’s cricket. Goosebumps all over. What a stage and these teams have earned the right to stand out there and sing their anthems!

Here we go!! Who is pumped for this 🙋🏽‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/bcinTdnWp2 — Lisa Sthalekar (@sthalekar93) March 8, 2020

12:22 hrs: It is also Harmanpreet’s birthday, we can only guess what can be the best gift for her. And, her parents are also here at the MCG. Who else is pumped up?

11: 58: Here are the teams -

Australia: Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning (c), Ashleigh Gardner, Rachael Haynes, Jess Jonassen, Sophie Molineux, Nicola Carey, Delissa Kimmince, Georgia Wareham, Megan Schutt

11:50 hrs: Australia will bat first.

Meg Lanning: “It looks like a really good wicket. The crowd is amazing. We’re looking forward to it. We’re as ready as we can be today. We’ve gone with the same team tonight (from the semi).”

Harmanpreet Kaur: “We also wanted to bat first but we are quite confident chasing so if our bowlers do a job it will be good for us.”

11:23 hrs: Meet the family - While the Indian women’s team bonded over cricket, gym sessions, music, dance, selfies, and their victories on the field, the parents of some of the team’s key players arrived in Australia to do some bonding of their own. Read the story here.

11:02 hrs: MCG will be packed and Harmanpreet is pumped up - “It’s a great feeling because for the first time we are going to see around 90,000 people in the stadium,” Harmanpreet says. Even as she claims, “we are used to playing in front of a lot of crowd around us,” it is expected to be nothing close to what she has ever seen earlier. But she has the message clear for her teammates, “Everybody knows there is going to be a lot of noise in the stadium and they will keep an eye on each one of us. We just need to enjoy this moment instead of thinking about what can trouble us, because it’s a big moment.

10:59 hrs: India’s road to the final - They have been unbeaten in the tournament so far and hence, when the semi-final match was washed out against England, the side progressed through to the finals. Here is how their journey have been.

10:57 hrs: How will the weather behave? After rain played a defining part in the semi-final clashes, all eyes will also be on the weather. However, as per the weather forecast, we should get on a full days’s play as the forecast is set fair.

10:34 hrs: Australia are the number 1 ranked side in world, India are the in-form team. This final is expected to be a bumper clash. The stage is set and MCG is expected to be packed."

Updated: Mar 08, 2020 09:47 IST

Chennai Super Kings are underway with their training camp ahead of their 2020 Indian Premier League (IPL) season opener against defending champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on March 29. The return of MS Dhoni to competitive cricket after a gap of nearly a year is one of the biggest side stories to the event. On Saturday, CSK tweeted a picture of Dhoni with the wicket-keeper’s gloves.

“I see icy eyes,” said three-time IPL champions in their caption to the image. In his absence from the Indian team, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul have taken up the wicket-keeping role in the Indian team.

Dhoni last played for India in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup after which he took a sabbatical from competitive cricket.

It is widely expected that his performance at this year’s IPL will be pivotal in deciding whether he will be selected in the Indian team that will go to Australia later in the year for the 2020 T20 World Cup."

Updated: Mar 09, 2020 09:20 IST

Seasoned India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has questioned the national selectors for ignoring traditional spinners and for picking Washington Sundar over the likes of Jalaj Saxena and Akshay Wakhare. Harbhajan believes that both Saxena and Wakhare are not getting chances despite being good performers in the domestic circuit is having an impeding influence on the growth of finger spinners in the country.

“There is a spinner named Jalaj Saxena (347 FC wickets and 6334 FC runs). They just refuse to consider him. He has been bowling superbly for so many seasons. Wakhare (279 wickets in 83 FC games) is a consistent bowler but no one looks at him. And then you say, spinners are getting lost in Indian cricket. He must have done something good for Vidarbha to have won the Ranji Trophy twice,” he was as quoted by Sportstar.

The CSK-player was not convinced with the selection of Sundar as he believed that the Tamil Nadu player does not spin the ball and lacks in skills.

“They pick this guy called Washington Sundar, who doesn’t even spin the ball. I just don’t get it. Why don’t you encourage a bowler who bowls genuine spin, who can lure the batsman out and have him stumped. If Washington can bat a bit, so can Jalaj, who is also a proper spinner,” he further added.

“You have to develop these bowlers by giving them confidence. I want to know what wrong has Saxena done? Has he, Wakhare or Shahbaz Nadeem committed a crime by taking wickets?” Harbhajan went on to add.

Washington has been a part of India’s T20I setup for a while now and he will look to further boslter his case when he turns out for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League."

“I just want the World Cup Trophy as my birthday gift on Sunday,” said the Indian women’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the pre-match press conference ahead of the T20 World Cup final.

Her fellow middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues is hoping that’s exactly the gift Kaur will get.

“We should be gunning to give the captain the biggest birthday gift by winning the final,” Rodrigues said in a TV interview during the tournament.

Winning the World Cup for their captain, in fact, has been on the team’s mind for some time now. In October, when Kaur became the first Indian player to play 100 T20Is, Rodrigues posted a tribute on Instagram, with teammate Harleen Deol and her rapping ‘public machati shor hain/jab marti harry kaur hain/na deti kabhi gaali/soh match khelne wali/ poora karna sapna hain/world cup ab toh apna hain’.

This is a captain that inspires fierce loyalty, and a team that likes to stick together, and have fun doing it. This is a team that believes in singing and dancing. Just follow Rodrigues’ hilarious and immersive twitter account—she calls herself Lil J—for a sense of the joy with which the squad goes about their business.

“This outfit is the most fun, I have to say this,” opener Smriti Mandhana said in an interview during the tournament. “The way coach WV Raman and Harman have handled and given confidence to players like Shafali (Verma) is also commendable.”

It’s an astute observation from Mandhana; it takes an assured touch to work with a team full of teenagers—Verma is just 16—and bring out superb performances from them at the biggest platform of the game.

“Harman didi bahut encourage karti hain muje. She keeps telling me to enjoy and play my natural game. When I am at the crease, I just go for my shots,” Verma said recently.

If the captain wears her role with distinction, Rodrigues wears hers—as the team’s comic spark—with great style.

If the team knows synchronized dance moves, it’s because Rodrigues taught them; if the team likes a certain song, it’s because Rodrigues, the official DJ of the dressing room, played it.

“All of us like to give 100 percent on the field, and have fun when not playing cricket,” says wicket-keeper Taniya Bhatia. “It helps keep the pressure away.”

The team has travelled some distance from those bitter memories of the 2018 World Cup in West Indies, where they were knocked out by England in the semis. After the exit, the team was engulfed in a controversy involving Kaur, the senior player Mithali Raj and the then coach Ramesh Powar.

Raj, who had done well in the previous matches in the tournament, was dropped by the team management in the semi-final. A can of worms was opened when bitter emails were exchanged between Powar, Raj and the BCCI. Soon, Powar’s tenure as coach came to an end. A few months later Raj quit T20 cricket."

An inform India will take on hosts Australia in the final of the T20 World Cup in Melbourne and this is expected to be a bumper contest between two evenly matched sides. After rain played a defining part in the semi-final clashes, all eyes will also be on the weather. However, as per the weather forecast, we should get on a full days’s play as the forecast is set fair.

The pitch itself should be hard and flat and this should suit the strengths of both the sides. MCG will be buzzing and the players will have to deal with nerves. “We are going to have 90,000 in the stadium and it’s a great feeling. We just need to enjoy the moment because it’s a big moment for all of us,” Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur said on the eve of the match.

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final after their last-four clash against England was abandoned due to rain.Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, taking Indians into the summit clash.

If there were any perceptions about the threat of coronavirus in the city, its cricket fans certainly didn’t show it. Mumbaikars thronged to the Wankhede Stadium in numbers to relive some of their golden memories of watching the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Brian Lara and Yuvraj Singh in action.

There were doubts about the response to the initiative of gathering veterans to play a tournament at a time when the world is reeling from the fast-spreading virus. However, to the amazement of all the players, a packed Wankhede greeted the India and West Indies legends on Saturday night.

Playing to promote the ‘Road Safety Week’, both teams were studded with some big names. But, most of all, the crowd had turned up to watch Lara and Tendulkar turn back the clock. Much to their delight, the two best batsmen of their era didn’t disappoint.

West Indies Legends batted first and Lara set the tone with two extravagant lofted drives off Zaheer Khan. At the score of 17, he was out, stumped by keeper Sameer Dighe off Irfan Pathan, but he had given the crowd what they had come to see with four beautifully timed fours.

When India’s turn came to bat, chasing 151, Tendulkar came up with the perfect response to the Caribbean master’s cameo, treating his home crowd to his trademark strokes all around the wicket en route to a 29-ball 36.

To add to the fun, Tendulkar’s opening partner, Sehwag, also showed glimpses of his former self during a typically destructive 57-ball unbeaten 74 to power the home team to a seven-wicket win. Tendulkar and Sehwag’s entry into the ground was greeted with a thunderous applause and Sehwag livened up the proceedings by smashing the first two balls of the innings for fours, the second a glorious front foot cover drive on a bent knee."

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 23:56 IST

Australian Marnus Labuschagne’s first one-day international century proved to be in vain as South Africa breezed to a six-wicket victory in Potchefstroom on Saturday and a clean sweep of the three-match series.

After being sent into bat, Australia posted a below-par 254 for seven in their 50 overs, with South African-born Labuschagne hitting a run-a-ball 108 to bolster an otherwise mediocre effort from the visitors.

The home side always looked in control of their chase, JJ Smuts playing the anchor role with a career-best 84 and ably supported by other new faces Kyle Verreynne (50) and Heinrich Klaasen (68 not out) as they romped to victory with 27 balls remaining.

South Africa continued their recent dominance of Australia in this format having won 11 of their last 12 ODI meetings dating back to 2016.

“We have not been at our best, we have been good in patches and then let our foot off the gas,” Australia captain Aaron Finch said at the post-match presentation.

“Credit to South Africa, they put us under pressure with bat and ball. We only took 12 wickets in the series, but all round we have not been at our best.”

Australia struggled to get going in their innings, managing just 39 in the first 10 overs for the loss of David Warner (4), and were three down for the addition of another 16 runs as South Africa picked up the key wickets of Steve Smith (20) and Finch (22).

Finch was a debut wicket for South African seamer Daryn Dupavillon (1-21), who was in the team after the home side rested the spearhead of their attack, Lungi Ngidi.

Labuschagne set about rebuilding the innings, though, as he put on 81 for the fourth wicket with D’Arcy Short (36) and 53 for the fifth with Mitchell Marsh (32).

He reached his maiden ODI century off exactly 100 balls, much to his delight and that of a sizeable group of family and friends in the stands.

South Africa’s chase came at a good rate, with Smuts’s 84 coming off 98 balls, including 12 fours, before he fell with his hundred, and victory, in sight.

He added 96 with Verreynne for the third wicket, a partnership that laid the platform for a comfortable victory as man of the series Klaasen smashed the winning runs with a six to take his tally in the three matches to 242.

Opening batsman Janneman Malan was on Saturday added to South Africa’s squad for the upcoming three-match ODI series in India on the back of his strong show against Australia.

Malan will be part of a 16-man squad which will depart for India from here on Sunday.

“Proteas opening batsman, Janneman Malan has been included into the team’s ODI tour to India. They will now travel with a 16-man squad for the three-match series taking place in Dharamshala, Lucknow and Kolkata,” Cricket South Africa said.

“The team departs for India tomorrow morning,” it added.

The series begins in Dharamshala on Thursday, followed by matches in Luncknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18).

The 23-year-old was not included in the squad which was announced last Monday after being dismissed first ball on his ODI debut against Australia.

He made a strong case for inclusion when he scored a match-winning 129 not out in the second match against Australia in Bloemfontein on Wednesday."

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 21:39 IST

Coronavirus scare could impact the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL). Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope has commented on the spread of the contagious virus and its impact on the T20 league. Tope has said that IPL can be held on a later date in view of the spread of the novel coronavirus around the country. Defending champions Mumbai Indians are scheduled to host Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium on March 29 in the opening match.

“There is always a possible danger of spread (of contagious diseases) when large numbers of people gather in one place... Such (IPL) events can always be organised later,” Tope told mediapersons.

He also said that discussions are currently on in official circles whether to postpone the IPL, and a decision would be taken and announced shortly.

The minister’s remarks came just over three weeks before the start of the 2020 season of IPL.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 20:17 IST

The India team seems to be heavily invested in spin, as evident in New Zealand where they had four spinners in the squad for the five-match T20I series that they won 5-0. The spinners however didn’t pass with flying colours. Ravindra Jadeja kept a tidy economy of 5.9 in the three matches he played, Yuzvendra Chahal had his moments but took just three wickets with an economy of 8.35 in five matches, Washington Sundar too conceded 44 runs in five overs while Kuldeep Yadav didn’t get a game at all. Yadav got only one game later, at the first ODI in Hamilton but he leaked 84 runs for just two wickets.

These are not impressive numbers, especially in the run-up to the T20 World Cup this October in Australia. Does this team have spinners who can take conditions out of the picture? That should be the question troubling new chairman of selectors Sunil Joshi, himself a spinner, the most. India are yet to identify that match-winning spinner as their best bet Kuldeep Yadav is woefully short of confidence. Joshi may want to listen to the assessment of previous selection committee chairman MSK Prasad. “Of late, I have seen our spinners are being sorted out. Either our spinners have to come up with new ideas, or we have to use the pool of bowlers from the bench who can be tried out in the next few series,” said Prasad in an interview.

From being India’s match-winning wrist-spinning duo after the 2017 Champions Trophy, Yadav and Chahal’s stocks have plummeted dramatically. They no longer inspire the confidence in the captain to select them together in any match. Yadav has played just one T20I in the last 12 months. In 15 ODIs, he took 17 wickets at an average of 45 in the past year. “There is no doubt about Kuldeep and Chahal’s skill sets but they have to develop something new. They have to keep evolving with every passing series, and come out with a plan to bowl in home and away conditions,” said Prasad.

Captain Virat Kohli has also spoken about Yadav and Chahal’s batting limitations that weaken the lower-middle order. Prasad backs Kohli’s assessment, elaborating the explanation. “Unlike Test cricket, bowling can’t be an exclusive discipline in T20Is. When you look to compare a very good spinner with a spinner who is 20% less (effective) than him but bats and fields well, the latter may be preferred,” said Prasad, explaining how Krunal Pandya and Sundar all had a go.

Also Read: Pietersen Tweets about inspirational Indian women, Col. Rathore reacts

But with limited time before the World Cup, Joshi and his committee will need to find ways to revive Yadav’s limited-overs career. Yadav hasn’t been the same after the clobbering he got in the last Indian Premier League (9 matches, 4 wickets and an economy of 8.66). He couldn’t build on the hattrick taken against West Indies in an ODI in Visakhapatnam last year either. “The spinners have delivered earlier. Spinners have taken 70% of our wickets in the shorter formats last one year. Full credit to them but now they have to come up with something new. Technology is evolving and opposition comes well prepared. To counter that you need to have sufficient weapons in your armoury. That was the beauty of spinners like Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. They kept adding something to their bowling.”

Ironically Harbhajan doesn’t appear to be a big fan of the Prasad-led selection committee’s spin vision. “They pick this guy called Washington Sundar, who doesn’t even spin the ball. I just don’t get it,” Singh told The Hindu. Sundar, who often bowls in the opening powerplay, fits well in Prasad’s team for the World Cup. “Sundar can be fantastic in T20s, going forward,” he said. Asked to name other backups, Prasad picked Rahul Chahar and K Gowtham.

On excluding Pujara and Rahane in England and South Africa series openers

From the 2018 South Africa series, the new reforms came into picture and the constitution says that the selection committee has no role in picking the playing eleven. I totally disagree. If the selection committee picks team with the captain, what’s wrong in the selector being part of picking the playing eleven? Whoever is the travelling selector carries the collective view of the selection committee. When you are in the team environment, you might not want to disappoint X, Y, Z. But when a selector comes in, he comes with a dispassionate view. That view can come in handy.

Pant over Saha in overseas Tests

I support that. In India, your skills as a wicket-keeper are tested so much. So, we have the best wicket-keeper in Saha, keeping at home, the specialist comes in. Otherwise, it is horses for courses. Your wicket-keeping skill sets are not tested as much as batting while playing abroad. Pant, with his batting, brings more value to the team than Saha while playing abroad. In the history of Indian cricket, Pant is the only wicket-keeper batsman to get a hundred in Australia and England. On his debut, he got 10 catches.

KL Rahul over Pant in white-ball cricket

I don’t know the combinations in mind of the team management. But KL Rahul has justified the faith reposed in him by the team management. In fact, he has exceeded expectations. It’s not that Pant was not given opportunities. What happens is, when you are going through a rough patch, you need to sit back and understand and read your game. He is going through that phase. Sooner or later, he will stake claim again. Currently, with Rahul keeping wickets, it is also helping the team combination. With two good openers at the top, KL Rahul not finding a place with the kind of talent he possesses was unfortunate. With KL keeping wickets and coming in the middle order and showing the responsibility and maturity, he grabbed the opportunity. A good IPL season will help Pant’s cause. He needs a couple of good knocks to keep him in good stead. He is hardly 22, and he will come back strong.

MS Dhoni’s future

I don’t want to say anything on that. He made his point very clear to all of us and it should he kept confidential.

R Ashwin

When we gave Kuldeep and Chahal opportunity, they grabbed it with both hands. Jadeja brought in his all-round ability. I don’t say anyone is written off. He is making his best efforts to try and come back. Let’s see how it progresses. When you are playing abroad, teams are picked on your and opposition’s strengths and weakness. He may be missing out because of that. There are no two ways about the fact that Ashwin is a legend. He and Virat are two legends currently playing in the Test team. He is almost like Virat when it comes to the spin department. Everyone goes through this phase. Let’s see how he comes out of it.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:20 IST

A day after he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Jyotiraditya Scindia was welcomed by Home Minister Amit Shah.

“Met Shri @JM_Scindia ji. I am sure his induction into the party will further strengthen BJP’s resolve to serve the people of Madhya Pradesh,” Shah said on Twitter. He also posted a photo of hugging and greeting Scindia.

Scindia, the Madhya Pradesh politician whose surprise exit from the Congress has brought the Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday. Scindia joined the BJP at an event in national capital Delhi in the presence of party chief JP Nadda.

Scindia had ended his 18-year-old association with the Congress on Tuesday after meetings with Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had thanked PM Modi and Shah for making him a part of their family.

In his resignation letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi that Scindia put out on Twitter soon after, he alluded to his discomfort in the party over the last year or so. “...as you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year,” he had written in his letter.

It was seen as a reference to the Congress settling for Kamal Nath as the chief minister after the 2018 state elections though it was Scindia who had led from the front to oust the BJP from Madhya Pradesh. Scindia’s supporters had hoped that the Congress would tell Kamal Nath to give up his second charge - as the party chief in the state - but this also didn’t happen.

Scindia’s grandmother, Vijaya Raje Scindia, was one of the founders of the Jana Sangh, the precursor to the BJP. His aunt Vasundhara Raje is a former Union minister and ex-chief minister of Rajasthan and another aunt Yashodhara Raje is a former minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet."

Hotstar has rolled back “Disney+ Hotstar” rebranding in less than a day after it was made available to all users in India. According to many users on Twitter, Disney+ content vanished after the company rolled out another update on late Wednesday. With the new update, the “Disney+ Hotstar” logo has reverted to the updated Hotstar logo.

Earlier, Hotstar in a statement clarified the availability of Disney+ content was part of a beta trial with limited number of users. It also pointed out that the official Disney+ India launch on Hotstar is still scheduled for March 29, as announced earlier.

“A limited release of the beta version of the Disney+ Hotstar app is currently being tested with a small number of consumers, in preparation for the full-fledged app launch on 29th March,” a Hotstar spokesperson said following the availability of Disney+ content in India.

As said earlier, many users on Twitter have pointed out that “Disney+” content are missing from the Hotstar app, a quick search on the Android version showed series like “The Mandalorian”. However, other top Disney+ Originals like “The World According to Jeff Goldblum” were missing after the update. As expected, some users aren’t very happy with the move.

The only flaw in Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited is that he does not have the Whitman brothers—Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman—ride across the sumptuous Indian countryside on a Royal Enfield motorcycle. (They ride a Honda, which, I guess, is fair. Honda owns 26% of the motorcycle market in India.)

But I would have made it a Royal Enfield. The Indian connection is perfect: The formerly British brand is a publicly offered subsidiary of Eicher Motors Ltd. and located in Chennai, India; it manufactures all of the 900,000 bikes it sells worldwide each year there, too. (Design and engineering are handled out of the Bruntingthrope Proving Ground near Leicester, England, and in Chennai, India.) Myriad Bollywood stars, plus Brad Pitt, are fans.

Most important, Royal Enfield motorcycles have the same vintage feel and styling—like threadworn but chic mustard-yellow corduroy—that makes Anderson’s movies so charming. The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 I rode for a week in Los Angeles is not the smoothest, the fastest, or the most efficient of the motorcycles I’ve ridden recently. But with the cool vintage styling, affordable performance, and reliable construction that match the promise of its brand, it’s the most endearing.

Iconic and Affordable

You’ve probably heard the name before. Royal Enfield is the brand name under which the Enfield Cycle Company of Worchestershire, England, produced motorcycles, bicycles, and even lawnmowers after incorporating in 1896. It made its first motorcycle in 1901.

It’s the oldest continually produced motorcycle brand in the world. During World War II, the British War Office used the Royal Enfield WD/RE, aka “Flying Flea,” to transport messages between airborne and ground troops; the bike was so light it could be dropped by parachute or carried in gliders. The company’s old-world, military-style Bullet models from the early 1930s are the most recognizable from the early days, though the original Interceptors made from 1960 to 1970 look cooler.

In 2015, it surpassed Harley-Davidson in global motorcycle sales, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in the U.S. who actually owns one—the brand sold just 3,500 motorcycles in the U.S. in 2019. Breean Poland, the head of marketing for Royal Enfield in America, says that’s changing: “We have consistently increased sales and dealership presence year over year since taking over ownership of sales and distribution in 2016,” she said in an email. “Our [650-engine] lineup and affordability has put us in a prime position to capitalize on a segment that we feel many manufacturers are overlooking.”

Royal Enfield North America currently offers the Bullet 500, Classic 500, Himalayan, and the all-new 650 Twin motorcycles (the INT 650 and Continental GT 650) in the U.S. market. The modern Interceptor I rode was introduced in 2018. Known in the U.S. as INT650, it carries the same look as the original: a single round headlight up front, classic teardrop tank, wide-set and upright handlebars, and a flat seat perfect for two riders.

I loved the bike because of how inexpensive it was—just $5,799 for the one I rode, painted in straight-from-the 1970s Orange Crush—without sacrificing such period-correct details as that headlight, the clean lines, and the perfect diamond-quilted black-leather seat you could imagine sitting on while riding through Laurel Canyon with your beau. (Other colour options for the gas tank, such as the cool $6,499 Glitter and Dust silver tone, cost marginally more.)

The 18-inch, 36-spoke aluminum alloy wheels with Pirelli tires were specifically made for this model; the twin-pod instrument cluster with small digital instrument screens is simple to read; the wide-braced handlebars allow for a commanding view of the road and an upright seating position.

Down for the Ride

As I stepped onto the bike for the first time one late February afternoon, I noticed that the 804-mm (31-inch) seat ride height would be easily rideable for shorter riders under 5-foot-5 tall, especially those wearing boots. (Taller riders such as myself, and those who prefer the tall, upright feel of dirt- and touring bikes, may find it slightly low.) It started easily with one press on the tiny lever under my thumb; cold starts are no issue here. The air- and oil-cooled, 648-cc parallel-twin engine gargled to life; I smoothly twisted the throttle and swung out of the driveway and onto the street.

The INT650 has 47 horsepower on its 202kg (445 pound) body—plenty of grit and thrust to stay stable at 60 mph and 70 mph on the highway, though heavier, larger and more experienced riders will quickly wish for more power. It comes with six quick speeds, ABS and a forgiving, piggyback reservoir suspension chosen for its clean and modern look in the rear subframe. As I wound through downtown L.A., I found it to have a good lean angle and easy handling across tight turns and pivots in the road. It worked best winding through the galleries and cafes of L.A.’s arts district and cruising over the historic concrete bridges of the Los Angeles River.

Even better, the gas tank holds 4.8 gallons and gets roughly 60-70 miles per gallon depending on how aggressively you ride.

Longtime riders will notice that the INT650 is neither as smooth nor refined as a Ducati or Triumph bike, or as hefty underneath as a BMW rNineT. But Royal Enfield amply fulfills its promise to deliver “iconic and affordable” motorbikes. It proves you don’t have to pay the premium ($14,000 for the Triumph Scrambler; $8,699 for the Harley-Davidson Street Rod) to own something that harkens back to easy, cool, California carefree living.

The Interceptor 650 certainly qualifies for that distinction. It was a joy to ride. After one week with it, I was ready to film a Darjeeling Limited of my own.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:47 IST

South Korea is one such country which has succeeded in cutting down the number of coronavirus infections after being one of the worst-hit outside China. Even though on Thursday it reported 114 new cases of coronavirus and six more deaths, the numbers are far lower than the peak of 909 cases reported on February 29, news agency Reuters reported. Health officials say the trend does appear to be slowing in what has been the largest outbreak in Asia outside of China.

South Korea’s trace, track and test approach seems to have been working in its favour, something which the South Indian state of Kerala also seem to have tried recently to contain the rise in coronavirus cases.

On Wednesday, Pathanamthitta district administration released two sets of maps giving a detailed account of three people’s travel after they arrived at the Cochin International Airport on February 29. The chart gives an account of their movement from the airport to their hospitalisation on March 6.

The three travellers flew in from Italy and slipped out of the Cochin International Airport after dodging health authorities. They surfaced after testing positive for the novel coronavirus and are believed to have transmitted the virus to eight of their relatives.

“It was a laborious job. This flowchart helps people who came in contact with them to get tested for possible infection,” said district collector PB Nooh.

The maps were prepared with the help of health officials, the police, locals and relatives of the three people and exhibit a detailed account of all the places they had visited. According to the maps, the three patients had visited banks, hotels, bakeries, a church, hospitals, a bar and had taken public transport.

The South Korean authorities are also reported to have been vigorously tracing down the contacts of all those who tested positive for the virus. The infected individuals would also be traced back to at least 14 days to understand the possible spread of the virus. The process would even include tracking their credit card use, CCTV footage and mobile phone activity, news agency AFP reported.

Kerala continues to be on a coronavirus high alert. The total number of people under observation has crossed 3,000, state Health Minister KK Shailaja said on Wednesday.

“Of the 1,179 samples sent for testing, today 889 samples report came and all were negative and we are waiting for the results of another 213. As on date, we have 14 people who are positive and are under close observation,” said Shailaja yesterday.

The first three positive cases of coronavirus in India were confirmed in Kerala, all of them had recovered successfully.

The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 73 as on Thursday morning in India. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection."

Dark mode on Google Play Store has a light grey shade for the search bar. Other things like colours for text remain the same as seen on the light theme. Games and apps are recognized in green colour while movies and books are denoted by red and blue colours respectively. Text on the Google Play Store in dark mode is shown in white colour.

So far, dark mode has been rolled out only for Play Store on older Android devices. Other Google apps like Gmail, Chrome, YouTube already have dark mode but only for users on Android 10 devices. There’s no word on whether Google will extend dark mode availability for more apps but for now Android users can enjoy dark mode in Play Store."

In the midst of this, an Italian nurse has shared the stark reality of what it’s like for medical professionals treating people with the virus. Alessia Bonari admits in her post that she’s afraid to go to work and feels tired but will continue to do her job. A selfie of herself that she posted shows her face bruised by the mask she has to wear while working.

“I am a nurse and right now I am facing this medical emergency. I’m afraid too, but not going to go shopping, I’m afraid to go to work,” says the post when translated from Italian. She goes on to list some of the things that worry her on a daily basis during her job.

“I’m afraid because the mask may not adhere well to the face, or I may have accidentally touched myself with dirty gloves, or maybe the lenses do not completely cover my eyes and something may have passed,” she says.

“I am physically tired because the protective devices are bad, the lab coat makes me sweat and once dressed I can no longer go to the bathroom or drink for six hours,” she adds.

The whole thing is taking a toll on her psychologically as well and she isn’t alone in feeling this way. But she adds that this will not stop her or her colleagues to do their work.

“I will continue to take care of my patients, because I am proud and in love with my job,” she adds.

She ends her post by appealing to people to be selfless, safe and protect others during these trying times.

“I can’t afford the luxury of going back to my quarantined house, I have to go to work and do my part. You do yours, I ask you please,” she says.

Bonari’s post has collected over 7.3 lakh likes on Instagram and thousands of comments. People are thanking Bonari and other medical professionals like her who are treating those in need.

“You are an example Alessia, we are all with you. You are angels. Good job,” says a comment when translated from Italian. “Thank you very much for all you do,” says another. “Respect for you and all your colleagues,” reads a third.

Coronavirus has caused 827 deaths in Italy. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, Italy has shut down all stores except pharmacies and food shops.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 19:53 IST

While the Indian women’s team bonded over cricket, gym sessions, music, dance, selfies, and their victories on the field, the parents of some of the team’s key players arrived in Australia to do some bonding of their own.

Why is this significant? Well, for some parents, this will be the first time they’ll be watching their daughters play in an international match—a World Cup final is a good way to make that debut.

“I am excited to have my parents by my side in the climax of the World Cup,” said captain Harmanpreet Kaur during a press conference in Sydney after the semi-final tie was washed away. “My mother has never seen me in action on the field. My father has seen me play in college and school matches but never during an international game. For the first time they are travelling abroad, I feel very proud and emotional. Unfortunately, there was no game against England but they will be cheering us in the final.”

Kaur, who is from Moga in Punjab, became the first cricketer in India—male or female—to play 100 T20 internationals last October.

19-year-old middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues’ parents will be in attendance at the final too.

“From playing locally to stadiums, they’ve been by my side, working behind the scenes, and now have traveled across continents to make sure we have all the support we need! Nothing greater than taking on the World Cup with the strength of our parents by our side. Let’s do this,” tweeted Rodrigues.

Then there’s 16-year-old Shafali Verma, who’s taken the tournament by storm with her explosive batting—her father, Sanjeev, who was also her first coach, has never seen her play in an international match. That will change when walks into the MCG on Sunday.

It took some doing—the goldsmith from Rohtak was sponsored by the school Shafali attends to fly to Melbourne, while the Haryana Cricket Association pitched in to get him a quick visa.

“Apni betiyon ko World Cup jeetne hee toe dekhne aaye hain hum. Shafali bahut khush hai and final main bhi apne chauke and chakke marna chahti hai. Harman ne usko khuli choot di hai maarne ki (We have come here to see our girls win the World Cup. Shafali is very happy and wants to hit fours and sixes in the final. Harmanpreet has given her full freedom),” said Sanjeev from Melbourne.

Meanwhile, Australia pace spearhead Mitchell Starc will be at the final clash too, after being granted permission by the Australian cricket board to miss the final ODI against South Africa so he can watch his wife Alyssa Healy, the team’s wicket-keeper, in action. Starc said it was a “fantastic opportunity” to repay Healy after she was in attendance in 2015 when Australia won the men’s ODI World Cup at home.

A record crowd of over 80,000 people is expected at the MCG."

It is a “no brainer” that ICC should introduce reserve days for all World Cup knockout matches, including the men’s T20 showpiece later this year, Australian quick Mitchell Starc said on Saturday.

England women’s team was left aggrieved on Thursday after its semifinal clash against India was washed out without a ball being bowled and it sent Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. into the summit clash due to their top finish in the group stage.

“In my opinion, it’s a no-brainer,” Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. “I’m sure if both games were washed out, everyone would be barking mad at the ICC for no reserve days. Considering it’s a double header, there’s obviously no downside for either team with turnaround for time between finals.”

Starc, who left Australia’s tour of South Africa midway to watch his wife Alyssa Healy play in the T20 World Cup final against India, called for inclusion of reserve days in multi-nation tournaments.

“I only heard the other day that it’s the same (rules) for ours,” he said.

“It’s not for me to change the rules. It’s up to the ICC. If that’s the way they go for our World Cup, I think it needs to be looked at for World Cups and all world events going forward.” Australia is set to host the men’s T20 World Cup from October 18 to November 15."

Harmanpreet Kaur and her troops secured a place in the championship clash after rain washed out their semi-final against England on Friday. India went through on the basis on finishing top of their group.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison sent a message to PM Modi on social media ahead of the final, expressing his happiness over the prospect of a great match between two massive cricketing nations. He then went on to say that Australia will get the better of India.

Morrison’s post read: “Hey @narendramodi - Australia v India in the final of the Women’s @T20WorldCup in Melbourne tomorrow. Two great teams in front of a mega crowd at the MCG. It’s going to be a big night and superb match! And Australia all the way.”

PM Modi took of this message from Morrison and he agreed with him by saying it can’t get better than India and Australia meeting in the final. However, like his Australian counterpart, Modi backed his own nation to come out victorious.

India will take on Australia in the Women’s T20 World Cup final at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. With four T20 titles including the last one in West Indies, the Meg Lanning-led Australian side is superior on record and even on paper but on current form Harmanpreet Kaur’s India will have a slight edge over the hosts.

India had beaten Australia in the tournament opener courtesy some blistering batting at the top by Shafali Verma and crafty leg-spin from Poonam Yadav. India, who are making their maiden appearance in the final, would be hoping for something similar from them on Sunday.

Ahead of the final, India captain Harmanpreet Kaur expressed her concerns over the forced eight-day break after their semi-final was a washout. “We haven’t been outdoors much and we didn’t manage to play an important game against England. We were all in touch and doing indoor training, but it doesn’t give you full confidence because the surface is totally different. Everyone was in good touch and thinking about what they can do for the team,” said Kaur.

Here’s India’s Predicted XI for India vs Australia, Women’s T20 World Cup final

Shafali Verma

With 161 runs in 4 matches, Shafali Verma is India’s leading run-scorer in the tournament. More than the runs, the manner in which she gets them, has earned praise from all quarters. Ahead of the final, Australia pacer Megan Schutt expressed her concerns over running into Verma, who had hit her for 16 runs in an over in the group stages.

Smriti Mandhana

Before the tournament, India had their hopes pinned on Smriti Mandhana but Shafali Verma’s emergence took some pressure off the star left-hander. Mandhana would be hoping to come good in the big final against Australia on Sunday.

Jemimah Rodrigues

Jemimah Rodrigues has been the star for India with her off-field antics. With the bat in hand, she hasn’t been disappointing either. Jemimah had decent outings in the group stage matches against Australia and Bangladesh and she will have the crucial role batting at No.3 in the Women’s T20 World Cup final against Australia.

Harmanpreet Kaur

With scores of 2,8,1 and 15 – this has been a forgettable World Cup so far for batswoman Harmanpreet but captain Harmanpreet wouldn’t have any such complaints. She became the first Indian captain to take her team to the finals of the Women’s T20 World Cup and on Sunday she will become the first Indian to lead a team in an ICC event final on her birthday.

Deepti Sharma

Deepti was India’s top-scorer with an unbeaten 49 in the tournament opener against Australia. She has done a fine job to contain the batsman with the ball too.

Veda Krishnamurthy

The designated finisher of the Indian women’s team, Veda Krishnamurthy, proved her worth with a quickfire 20 off just 11 balls in India’s group stage encounter against Bangladesh. If India aim to put a big score against the strong Australian bowling line-up in the final then Veda’s role will be important.

Taniya Bhatia

Taniya Bhatia has been excellent behind the stumps. She has been one of the main reasons behind the success of the Indian spinners in the World Cup. When Mandhana was injured for the Bangladesh match, she was given the responsibility to open for India.

Shikha Pandey

The lone specialist seamer in the Indian side, the experienced Shikha Pandey has been spot on with her line and lengths in the tournament. She has picked up 7 wickets in the T20 World Cup so far and will have the responsibility of striking early with the new ball in the India vs Australia T20 World Cup final on Sunday.

Radha Yadav

Left-arm spinner Radha Yadav was the star for India in their last group stage match against Sri Lanka. She picked up 4 wickets for just 23 runs to emerge as the player of the match.

Rajeshwari Gayakwad

Another left-arm spinner and equally effective – Rajeshwari Gayakwad has been one of the most consistent performers for India in the last 12 months. She is yet to set the stage on fire in this world cup and would look to do the same in the final against Australia at MCG.

Poonam Yadav

India’s highest wicket-taker in this World Cup ( 9 wickets), leg-spinner Poonam Yadav will be one of the key weapons for India in the final. She had turned the game on its in the group stages against Australia by picking up 4 wickets."

Group Stage, Match 1: India beat Australia by 17 runs

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav bowled a magical spell to steer India to a comfortable 17-run win over defending champions Australia in the opening match of the tournament.Put in to bat, India struggled to a below par 132 before Poonam (4/19 in 4 overs) foxed the Aussies (115 all-out) with her googlies, turning the match decisively into her team’s favour.

Group Stage, Match 6: India beat Bangladesh by 18 runs

Poonam Yadav delivered for the second time in as many games as he timely dismissals led India to a comfortable 18-run win over Bangladesh. Invited to bat, a substantial partnership eluded them after a fiery start but India still managed to post a competitive 142 for six at the WACA ground. Bangladesh fought through Murshida Khatun (30) and Nigar Sultana (35) but Poonam rattled the middle and lower order with her strikes. In the end, Bangladesh could manage 124/8, giving the Women’s in Blue their second win in the tournament.

Group Stage, Match 9: India beat New Zealand by 3 runs

Shafali Verma’s 34-ball 46 followed by a superlative performance from the bowlers helped India notch up a narrow four-run win over New Zealand. Invited to bat, India posted a below-par 133/8 against New Zealand in the crucial group A match with Shafali top-scoring with a 34-ball 46 and Taniya Bhatia chipping in with a 25-ball 23. India, however, produced a disciplined performance with the ball to restrict New Zealand to 129/6 and register their third successive win in the tournament.

Group Stage, Match 13: India beat Sri Lanka by 7 wickets

Spinner Radha Yadav took career-best 4/23 before Shafali Verma’s blistering 34-ball 47 powered India to a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka. Opting to to bat, Sri Lanka were restricted to a modest 113 for nine in their final group match with left-arm spinner Radha (4/23) running through the rivals’ batting line-up, including claiming the prized scalp of skipper Chamari Atapattu. Shafali then top-scored as India chased down the target in just 14.4 overs.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 16:40 IST

Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Ehsan Mani on Saturday said the Asia Cup T20 later this year will be held at a neutral venue, virtually endorsing BCCI President Sourav Ganguly’s statement that the tournament will be held in Dubai.

A few days back, Mani had disagreed with Ganguly who had said that India can’t play in Pakistan -- the designated host country -- due to security concerns and that the Asia Cup will be held in the UAE. But, Mani on Saturday made the U-turn from his earlier stated position.

“We have to keep in mind the interests of associate members of the Asian Cricket Council. We can’t be stubborn and insist we will host the tournament in Pakistan because India is not willing to come to Pakistan. The option is it will be held at a neutral venue but that has to be decided by the ACC members,” Mani told the media in Islamabad.

Ganguly had noted that in 2018 when India was to host the tournament, it was held in the UAE because Pakistan could not play in India.

Asked where the Asia Cup would be held in September, Mani said this will be decided by the ACC when it meets later this month.

“No decision has been taken on whether it will be held in UAE or Bangladesh,” he said.

The ACC was due to meet in Dubai last week but the meeting was postponed because of the coronavirus fears.

The ACC is now due to meet later this month to decide the venue for the event in September.

Interestingly, while appearing before the National Assembly Standing Committee on inter-provincial affairs in Islamabad on Friday, Mani claimed that if Indian broadcasting/production crew was not involved, it would become impossible to show live the Pakistan Super League matches.

He also made it clear that the state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation did not have the facilities or trained manpower to show PSL or international matches live. He also conceded that the opening ceremony of the PSL-5 in Karachi had been a disappointment and was not up to the mark.

A controversy had erupted in Pakistan over the fact that a Indian director/event manager supervised the conduct of the opening ceremony at the National Stadium in Karachi."

He will be supporting Australia for sure but former pacer Brett Lee feels an Indian victory in Sunday’s T20 Word Cup final could be a “start of a major breakthrough” for the women’s game in the cricket-mad country.

India and Australia will lock horns in what is expected to be a blockbuster title clash at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

READ | Sourav Ganguly sends best wishes to Harmanpreet Kaur and Co ahead of Australia clash

“As an Australian, I’d love nothing more than for (Meg) Lanning’s team to do the job. But if India were to win the World Cup for the first time, victory would do so much for women’s cricket in a country that already adores the sport,” Lee wrote in an ICC column.

“This could be the start of a major breakthrough, particularly with the amount of talent that is coming through.” The former speedster said Australia will have to look for ways to counter the in-form 16-year-old Shafali Verma.

“In Shafali Verma, India boast one of the most talented players in the world and you feel that for Australia to win the game, dismissing her will likely be their first job.

“I’ve been so impressed with the opener - it’s staggering to believe she’s only 16 with the confidence she has in her own ability and the way she strikes the ball so cleanly.

“She’s such good fun to watch and I’m not sure the women’s game has seen anyone like her for such a long time.” Shafali has been the star of the tournament, having amassed 161 runs at a strike rate of 161, consistently providing India solid starts, and that was not lost on Lee.

“To be the world’s best T20 batter already shows just how far she has progressed in such a short space of time and the experience in this tournament will hold her in good stead for years to come.

“Even with the way she’s played in Australia and her fearless brand of cricket, you still get the feeling she has more to come as well.” He reckoned Shafali may have another big score awaiting her.

“She’s got a big score in her locker and there’s probably no better place to do that than the MCG. Shafali is already a record breaker but if she can steer her side to their first Women’s T20 World Cup title at just 16, then the sky really is the limit for her career.”"

Star Australian all-rounder Ellyse Perry has been ruled out of action for at least six months as she will undergo surgery on her injured hamstring next week.

It was during Australia final group game of the T20 World Cup against New Zealand that Perry had injured her right hamstring while trying an athletic throw in the field.

“The timing has been good, I still get to come tomorrow and next week I’ll (have surgery),” Perry was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“From my perspective, I’ve had the most incredible run, I’ve been very fortunate with injury for a long period of time,” added the 29-year-old, whose injury was the most severe for her in more than 12-year international career.

Perry, who is the reigning ICC Cricketer of the Year, will be out of Australia’s upcoming limited-overs tour of South Africa, beginning next Sunday, and also unlikely to feature in the upcoming Indian Premier League exhibition games in May.

Although she will not be able to turn up for Sunday’s final against India, Perry is happy she will be able to cheer for the team.

“I’m really excited about tomorrow. I think it’s one of those opportunities now for the whole squad to enjoy the occasion and make the absolute most of it, it’s a very special time,” she said.

“I’‘ll be trying to keep my nerves at bay. I feel incredibly fortunate and chuffed that Motty and the group wanted to keep me around, it’‘s nice to be here and take it all in.”"

The Indian women’s team will have to overcome big match pressure as it aims to exorcise the ghosts of the past in the T20 World Cup final against habitual winners Australia in front of a record crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. India go into the final unbeaten after topping the group stage where they had beaten the four-time champions Australia in the tournament-opener. After the semifinal against England was washed out, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led squad advanced to their maiden summit clash, having finished first in Group A.

The refreshing firepower of 16-year-old Shafali Verma at the top and consistency of India’s spin-heavy bowling attack has contributed massively to the team’s success so far in the competition. However, much more is needed from star batters Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet if India are to win their maiden ICC trophy."

Australia are focussing not only on the wily Poonam Yadav but preparing to take on India’s spin-heavy attack by practising against “slow spinners” ahead of Sunday’s Women’s T20 World Cup final. Poonam had bamboozled Australia in the opening game, snapping four wickets to power India to a 17-run win but skipper Meg Lanning urged her side to brace up for other threats including the left-arm Indian bowlers. “It’s not just Poonam we need to worry about. They’ve got some really good left-armers too, such as Rajeshwari Gayakwad. They’ve got a really strong line-up right through their bowlers and they have spinners who can change their pace,” Lanning said.

“We will be facing some slow spinners at training. We’ll be as prepared as we can be and making sure we adjust to what’s happening at the time.” India’s batting also boasts of young Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana besides all-rounder Deepti Sharma and Lanning said her bowling unit has to make the necessary adjustments when coming across India’s good batting unit.

“Obviously Smriti Mandhana is a world-class player too and Deepti Sharma has also played well against us. We feel our bowling line-up can adjust to different things,” she said. “We are very well prepared for what the game will throw at us. It’s going to be a tough, hard battle tomorrow against India but I feel we are as ready as we can be to take it on.”

Four-time champions Australia are no stranger to title wins. Lanning herself had guided the team to glory at the last edition in 2018 but the skipper said it will the “toughest battle” and “biggest moment” of her career when she walks out to a sold-out crowd at the MCG.

“We’re not coming just to put on a good show. We’re coming here to win and that’s the attitude we’re going in with. It’s been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I’ve not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,” she said.

“We haven’t played in front of a crowd this big before and we need to deal with that the best we can.”"

There is no doubt about the fact that Hardik Pandya is one of the most popular Indian cricketers going around. Whether it is his pyrotechnics with the bat, his acrobatic fielding or his off the field antics, Hardik Pandya somehow manages to add to his fan base with each passing days. The one’s present at the Dy Patil T20 Cup final got the first-hand proof of that. Thousands of fans swarmed inside the DY Patil stadium after the final between Reliance 1 and Indian Oil. Hardik Pandya’s team Reliance 1 lost the match by 11 runs but the fans did not care about that. They swarmed inside the stadium. And all of them had only name on their lips - Hardik Pandya.

Hardik Pandya was dismissed for a duck in the final but earlier in the day, he had slammed a 55-ball 158 in Reliance 1’s semi-final clash against BPCL. After the culmination of the final, thousands of fans invaded the pitch, chanting “Hardik, Hardik” as the noise reverberated in the stadium. Some of the fans even came near the Reliance 1 dressing room to get a glimpse of Hardik.

The Mumbai all-rounder has been in great form in the tournament. Before Friday’s breath-taking innings, Hardik had earlier scored 105 against CAG in a Group C encounter few days ago.

The 26-year-old is all set to return to the national team for the ODI series against South Africa that gets underway in Dharamsala on March 12. “He is fit and is set to return to the national team. Having first undergone rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy and now his performance in the T20 tournament has pretty much made it clear that he is fit to return to the fold,” a BCCI source was quoted as saying by IANS.

The DY Patil T20 tournament worked as the perfect training ground for the all-rounder who has been working on his back ever since he underwent surgery in the UK in October.Speaking on his fitness, Pandya said: “For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”

As for his blistering tons, Pandya said he keeps things simple. “If it’s there in my arc, I just back myself and go for it. Most of the time, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”

The all-rounder last featured for India in a T20I against South Africa in Bengaluru in September, 2019.

In DY Patil T20 Cup final, Dhawan (69 off 41 balls; 6x4, 2x6) single-handedly steered his team’s chase as all other Reliance 1 batsmen faltered.

The three India players Dhawan, Hardik and Bhuvneshvar Kumar were making comebacks to competitive cricket in this tournament after sustaining injuries.

Dhawan was caught in a horrible mix up and was run out. This eventually led to Reliance 1’s loss.

Hardik gave a sitter off Siddhesh Lad.

Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was expensive with figures of 0/50 from his four overs in the final.

However, for his show in the entire tournamemt, Hardik won three awards -- Maximum Sixes, Best Batsman and Player of the Tournament.

Pawan Negi was injured while batting, after being hit on his face when he was trying to make a pull shot. He was immediately taken off the field."

The brittle middle-order too needs to deliver. And besides doing the right things on the field, India will also have to win the battle of nerves in the all important game. Australia, who had beaten India in the preceding tri-series final, find themselves in familiar territory having made their sixth successive final in seven editions. They know how to win the big moments in high-pressure games, while India have been found wanting on that front. The visitors had capitulated to England in the 2017 ODI World Cup final and 2018 World T20 semifinal.

It may be a tad unfair on the teenager but the team will expect Shafali to provide another flying start and hope this time the experienced Mandhana too fires. There can’t be a bigger stage for Harmanpreet to be back amongst the runs and lead the team from the front. If it was not for Shafali, India would have struggled to post competitive totals with the middle and lower-order doing precious little. The team did not cross the 150-run mark in the group stage but still managed to get over the line, thanks to a disciplined bowling effort.

Leggie Poonam Yadav has made a sensational comeback from a finger injury and is tournament’s leading wicket-taker with nine wickets alongside Australia pacer Megan Schutt. Pacer Shikhar Pandey too has been impressive, while left-arm spin duo of Radha Yadav and Rajeshwari Gayakwad has kept things tight. It will be interesting to see how Australians play Poonam on Sunday as the leggie was all over them in the tournament opener.

More than 75,000 tickets have already been sold for the final and the figure could go as high as 90,000, unprecedented in women’s cricket. Australia, led by Meg Lanning, are backing themselves to win in front of the home fans though a sizable number of Indian fans too is expected at the iconic MCG.

Lead men’s team pacer Mitchell Starc will also be in attendance, rooting for the home team and his wife Alyssa Healy after getting clearance to leave South Africa in the middle of the tour. Australia’s campaign has been hit by injuries to pacer Tayla Vlaeminck at the start and star all-rounder Elysse Perry was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament before the semifinal against South Africa. Despite the twin setbacks, Australia have stormed into yet another title clash.

“We’re not coming just to put on a good show. We’re coming here to win and that’s the attitude we’re going in with. It’s been a long time coming and the build-up to the game is something I’ve not experienced before. It will be the biggest moment of my career,” said Lanning.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 20:49 IST

Former India opener and domestic cricket giant, Wasim Jaffer, announced his retirement from all cricket here on Saturday. The 42-year-old was part of 10 Ranji Trophy-winning sides, eight with Mumbai and the last two with Vidarbha.

The tall batsman played 31 Tests between 2000 and 2008—he made his debut against South Africa at the Wankhede Stadium in 2000—scoring 1,944 runs at an average of 34.01 with five centuries and 11 half-centuries. Jaffer, known for his resolve and stylish drives and flicks, hit his highest Test score of 212 against West Indies at St John’s, Antigua in 2006. The same year Jaffer played both his ODIs, against South Africa. He also scored a superb 202 against Pakistan at Kolkata in November 2007.

“Among moments I will cherish the most is getting my India Test cap, scoring 202 vs Pakistan, 212 vs West Indies and winning the Test series in West Indies and England in 2006-07,” Jaffer said in a statement on Saturday announcing his retirement.

Jaffer became the first cricketer to play 150 Ranji matches in December 2019, and the only Ranji batsman to complete the 12,000-run mark two months later. Of his record Ranji aggregate, 1,037 runs in 15 innings at 69.13 came for Vidarbha in their victorious 2018-19 campaign, thus becoming the only batsman to score 1,000 plus runs in two seasons, the previous effort having come in 2008-09.

Hailed for his longevity—he made his first-class debut in 1996-97—Jaffer played 260 first-class matches, scoring 19,410 runs at an average of 50.67 (57x100s, 91x50s) with his highest of 314* coming for Mumbai against Saurashtra in his debut season.

Jaffer shared the dressing room in the Indian team with some of the biggest names, and he recalled those days too. “I am honoured to have shared the dressing room with the likes of Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni to name a few. What can I say about Sachin (Tendulkar)? I could go on and on about him. He was my role model. Feel really blessed to have watched him play from such close quarters. In my opinion he was one of the best players of that era along with Brian Lara,” he said.

“My longest association was with the Mumbai team and it’s here that I learned about the khadoos (gritty) nature of cricket that Mumbai players are known for,” said Jaffer, who also captained Mumbai to two Ranji titles (their 38th and 39th).

“Represented the 41-time Ranji champions from my under-16 days till 2014. Sanjay Manjrekar was my first captain. I feel privileged to have shared the Mumbai dressing room with Sachin, Vinod Kambli, Zaheer Khan, Amol Muzumdar, Nilesh Kulkarni, to name few. After becoming the captain in 2008, I hope I passed on some legacy to Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Suryakumar Yadav, Aditya Tare and others,” he said.

His association with the Indian Oil has lasted more than two decades, in which he has helped and guided his Mumbai teammates such as Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and several more who were his juniors. Recalling his early days, Jaffer said, “My corporate team Indian Oil Corporation Ltd that has looked after me for 20 odd years. My school Anjuman-I-Islam from where my journey to become professional cricketer began. Sudhir Naik sir for giving me opportunity to play for National Cricket Club,” he added.

Jaffer holds a slew of domestic records, including Ranji appearances (156), aggregate (12,038 runs), most centuries (40) and catches (200). He helped Vidarbha win back-to-back titles in 2017-18 and 2018-19, but the team failed to qualify for the knockout stage this time with Jaffer nursing a knee problem as well.

“First of all I would like to thank the almighty Allah, who gave me the talent to play this beautiful game. I’d like to also thank my family—my parents and brothers for encouraging me to pursue the sport as a profession and my wife, who left a cosy life of England to create a lovely home for our children and me,” he said.

“A special thanks to all my coaches, right from my school days to professional cricket, for helping me polish my skills. A heartfelt thanks to the selectors who showed faith in me. My gratitude to all the captains I played under and all my colleagues from whom I learnt so much about the game and shared some lifelong memories. I would also like to thank all the support staff who were a constant pillar of support in my long journey. Thank you to the BCCI, Mumbai Cricket Association and Vidarbha Cricket Association for giving me the opportunity to represent them,” he added.

Jaffer added, “I would also like to thank Chandrakant Pandit for showing faith in me when no team showed any interest to have me as a professional for 2017-18 season. It is because of him that I got a chance to play for Vidarbha again and create history of winning a Ranji Trophy and Irani Cup twice.”

“My father wanted one of his sons to represent India and I feel proud to have fulfilled his dream. After all these years in cricket, it is time to move on. But just like the red-ball format which is very dear to me, it’s the end of only the first innings. I am looking forward to the second innings in any capacity, be it in coaching, commentary etc. As long as I stay involved with the game as this game has given me so much,” he said.

“Wishing you a happy 2nd innings of life @WasimJaffer14 bhai! Have good memories playing with you in Mumbai team. May God bless you in all your future endeavours!,” said India cricketer Ajinkya Rahane on Twitter after Jaffer made his announcement.

Former India batsman VVS Laxman said, “Many congratulations on a wonderful career @WasimJaffer14 , you can be very proud of yourself. Wish you a great second innings.”

“ WASIM JAFFER “ welcome to the band. You truly were inspirational. You pushed boundaries. Domestic cricket will be poorer without U. The mould was unique. As I always said across the dressing room, ‘Jaffara’ well batted...good wishes always!” (sic), said Amol Muzumdar, another domestic cricket giant who is second behind Jaffer in terms of most runs in Ranji Trophy.

Jaffer, who played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Royal Challengers Bangalore for one season, will be an assistant coach with Kings XI Punjab in the upcoming edition."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 20:50 IST

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 14:02 IST

The UK Budget tabled by Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to make the cost of long-term visas to Britain higher with a major hike in the compulsory health fee charged on migrants from countries, including India.

Sunak, born in the UK to a general practitioner father and pharmacist mother, announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) would be hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds.

“Migrants benefit from our NHS (National Health Service). And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.

The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.

The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.

The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.

Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.

“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.

“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.

Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:11 IST

South Carolina education officials have agreed not to enforce part of their own state law that bans sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual ones - unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases.

Civil rights groups last month sued the state, saying the law violated the U.S. Constitution. They also say it led to a hostile classroom climate that fostered bullying of students who are not heterosexual.

A federal judge on Wednesday signed a consent agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the state, in which both sides agree not to punish teachers who violate the law. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman now has 60 days to inform all of South Carolina’s public school superintendents of the deal, and the order that they must no longer follow the requirement.

The law states that any teacher who allows “a discussion of alternate sexual lifestyles” including “homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexually transmitted diseases” can be fired.

In the agreement, South Carolina conceded that its law “is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest” and would fail any level of judicial review under the Equal Protection Clause. The judge also barred state officials from enforcing or applying the requirement on teachers.

State officials had no immediate comment Wednesday, but told the judge in court papers that the agreement forged Wednesday is in the public interest. The deal is fair and reasonable, given the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, both sides said in requesting the deal. The South Carolina Attorney General’s Office had earlier issued an opinion that a court would likely conclude the law violates the Constitution.

The consortium of civil rights groups who filed suit said that one-sided sex education classes stigmatize non-heterosexual students —- a group already at a heightened risk of suicide.

Their lawsuit recounted the experience of one student from Greenville. He was in middle school when a classmate threw a Clorox wipe at him and “told him that he was diseased and that the stairway to hell was ‘rainbow-colored.’“ The classmate then kicked him in the chest.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 12:12 IST

Australia captain Meg Lanning says the defending champions’ rocky road to the Twenty20 World Cup final against India has them ready for the “biggest game” of women’s cricket in Melbourne on Sunday.

Since losing their tournament opener to India, the hosts lost talismanic all-rounder Ellyse Perry to injury and scraped through a string of do-or-die games, including the rain-hit semi-final against South Africa, to reach the Melbourne Cricket Ground decider.

Lanning said the testing campaign had them in good stead to take on Harmanpreet Kaur’s undefeated India.

“It hasn’t been an easy road to the final but I wouldn’t have had it any other way,” Lanning told reporters at the MCG on Saturday.

“We’re sort of match and battle-hardened, really.

“The last four games have been cut-throat, must-win clashes ... and we’ve had to deal with that pressure and the need to stand up when you’re under the pump.

“I’ve been extremely proud about how the group’s handled that.”

Australia, long the benchmark of women’s cricket, will bid for a record-extending fifth T20 World Cup title in front of a huge crowd at the 100,000-capacity stadium.

Organisers hope the attendance on International Women’s Day might set a record for a women’s sporting event.

“To know that game day’s tomorrow, we’re involved in the biggest game of women’s cricket that’s been, everyone’s just looking forward to the occasion,” said Lanning.

“I always dreamed of being involved in this game when I saw it was at the MCG and they were hoping for a big crowd.

“We’re not coming here just to put on a show, we’re coming here to win, that’s the attitude we’re going in with.”

Australia were comprehensively beaten by the Indians in the tournament opener at the Sydney Showgrounds, their batswomen struggling against the wrist spin of Poonam Yadav, who took 4-19.

Lanning said their would be plenty of practice against slow bowling at training and that “all options were on the table” in terms of selection changes, pending a review of the MCG pitch.

Although Australia were yet to play their “best game”, Lanning said there was little need for major changes.

“I think we’ve shown that we’re able to cope and be really calm under pressure and that’s what’s going to be needed tomorrow,” she said.

“Often in finals you don’t need to go above and beyond what you’ve already presented. It’s actually just about producing that again and making sure you do the basics really well.

“Especially early in the game when there are a lot of nerves flying around, that’s going to be really important.

“I think the team that settles the quickest will give themselves a really good chance in this game.”"

India’s entry in the final of Women’s T20 World Cup stirred up a controversy. The Harmanpreet Kaur-led side were unbeaten in the group stages and finished at top of the table. India’s semifinal against England was washed out without a ball being bowled. There was no reserve day for the semis, and as per the tournament’s rules, the team finishing higher in the group stages was given a qualification to the final.

The defending champions Australia beat South Africa by 5 runs in the 2nd semifinal to set up a date in the final with India, which will take place at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday. But here is the big question - what if the final gets washed out?

Here is what the tournament’s rules dictate:

If the final gets washed out, and no result is attained by the pre-decided time, then the match will be restarted on Monday, which is kept as the reserve day. In case, the reserve day also gets washed out, then the two teams will be sharing the trophy.

“We did get rest also because when you’re playing for a long time, you need a break. No-one wanted to take rest, everyone was so keen, everyone was on the ground and ready to deal with the situation.” Over 75,000 tickets have been sold for the finals and Harmanpreet said her team will look to enjoy the big stage and play positive cricket."

A forced eight-day break has affected India’s preparations going into the Women’s T20 World Cup final on Sunday but the team is ready to rise to occasion in front a record crowd at the MCG, said skipper Harmanpreet Kaur. An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden T20 World Cup summit clash after their last-four clash against England was washed out on Thursday.

“We were all in touch and doing indoor training, but it doesn’t give you full confidence because the surface is totally different. Everyone was in good touch and thinking what they can do for the team.

“We did get rest also because when you’re playing for a long time, you need a break. No-one wanted to take rest, everyone was so keen, everyone was on the ground and ready to deal with the situation.” Over 75,000 tickets have been sold for the finals and Harmanpreet said her team will look to enjoy the big stage and play positive cricket.

“It’s a great feeling. It’s the first time we’re going to see 90,000 people in the stadium and we’re really looking positive for that,” said Harmanpreet, who has played in front of a sold-out crowd in the 2017 Cricket World Cup Final against England at Lord’s.

“We are used to playing when a lot of crowd is around us. Sometimes there’s no noise going around in the stadium so we need to keep an eye on each of us. It’s a big moment.

“Rather than thinking about what is going to trouble us, it’s only about being there, enjoying the moment and giving our best.” India had defeated Australia by 17 runs in the opening match of the tournament but Harmanpreet said it would be a fresh start for the two teams.

“One thing, we have to keep in mind Sunday is a fresh day, a fresh start. We have to start from ball one,” he said.

“We’ve done quite well in the league games. Both teams are under pressure and both are capable of winning.”"

It might have taken a little longer than expected, but India all-rounder Hardik Pandya is set to return to the national team for the ODI series against South Africa that gets underway in Dharamsala on March 12.

Speaking to IANS, sources in the know of developments said that the DY Patil T20 tournament worked as the perfect training ground for the all-rounder who has been working on his back ever since he underwent surgery in the UK.

“He is fit and is set to return to the national team. Having first undergone rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy and now his performance in the T20 tournament has pretty much made it clear that he is fit to return to the fold,” the source said.

Post his surgery, Pandya had initially hired the services of Delhi Capitals trainer Rajnikanth Sivagnanam to undergo rehab with Team India physio Yogesh Parmar keeping an eye on Pandya’s progress post his back surgery in October.

But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly made it clear that all players must report to the NCA to undergo rehab.

The Indian team management then convinced Pandya to head to the NCA when he trained with the players at the Wankhede Stadium before the ODI against Australia. “The team management spoke to him when he trained with Virat Kohli and boys on the eve of the opening ODI against Australia at the Wankhede Stadium and asked him to complete his rehab at the NCA,” a source said.

Having completed the process, he returned to the field in the ongoing T20 tournament in Navi Mumbai and has already hit two hundreds.

Speaking on his fitness, Pandya said: “For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”

As for his blistering tons, Pandya said he keeps things simple. “If it’s there in my arc, I just back myself and go for it. Most of the time, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”"

Speaking in an interview to Mid-Day, the former India wicketkeeper talked about India’s inability to win Test series in South Africa and England, and said that he would have been more satisfied had the side clinched those series.

“My regret is that we were so close to winning the Test series in South Africa and England. We could have definitely won those two series. We didn’t clinch those crucial moments in Cape Town, Edgbaston and Southampton,” Prasad said.

He further added: “Had we won those Test series, it would have given me much more satisfaction.”

Under Prasad’s term as chief selector, India also came close to winning the World Cup in 2019, but were knocked out after losing to New Zealand in the semifinal. Prasad also added that one session in that match cost his side. “The same with the 2019 World Cup where we dominated till the semi-final but that one day, one session [v New Zealand in the semis] cost us dear,” he said.

But he had a definite answer when asked about the biggest achievement of his selection committee.

Prasad said the highlight of his tenure was the smooth transition from MS Dhoni era to the Virat Kohli one. “I personally feel that my colleagues and me can take pride in the fact that we have successfully seen the transition period from MSD to Virat very well,” Prasad said."

South Africa women’s cricket team captain Dane van Niekerk hit out at critics for misinterpreting her ‘free pass’ statement after being knocked out of the Women’s T20 World Cup semi-final following a defeat to Australia. A lot of Indian fans lashed out at Niekerk after the South Africa skipper said she would rather lose than get a free pass into the World Cup final. The fans expressed their displeasure as they felt Niekerk’s comments were in direct reference to India’s advancement to the World Cup final despite the semi-final against England being washed out.

The South African all-rounder minced no words in her reply to the ones targeting her for her comments post the semi-final.

The whole debate started when India advanced to their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final after their semi-final against England was washed out at the Sydney Cricket Ground. There were no reserve days and as per the tournament rules, which are pre-decided, the team with a better standing at the end of the group stages advances to the next round. India had finished on top of Group A after winning all their matches while England had finished second to South Africa in Group B.

Interestingly, South Africa faced Australia in the same venue later on at SCG and they ended up losing the contest by 5 runs via the DLS method.

MSK Prasad whose term as the chief selector of the Indian cricket team ended a couple of days ago after BCCI’s CAC named former India spinner Sunil Joshi as his replacement, reflected back on his 5-year-long tenure with satisfaction. Often in the middle of criticism for being soft, Prasad had no qualms in pointing out the achievements of his selection committee.

The former India chairman of selectors, Prasad, mentioned India’s success in all three formats, their efforts in creating back-ups for every possible position and a few inspiring selections like Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya in Test matches.

Prasad, who took over as the chief selector of India after Roger Binny’s term ended prematurely in 2015 due to conflict of interest, also revealed what prompted the appointment of Virat Kohli as MS Dhoni’s successor.

“Once Mahi completed his [captaincy] stint, we had to look at somebody who could step into those shoes. We wanted to see that happening smoothly. Once Virat took over, we reached the No. 1 ranking across all three formats. That’s the biggest satisfaction I got,” added Prasad.

MS Dhoni had decided to retire from Test cricket midway through the Australia tour in late 2014 paving way for Virat Kohli to take over as India’s Test captain. Kohli was later on appointed India’s captain in all three formats after Dhoni decided to step down as limited overs captain in 2017.

Prasad’s selection committee - Sarandeep Singh, Jatin Paranjpe, Gagan Khoda (replaced by Harvinder Singh in new term), and Devang Gandhi - attracted some criticism for their handling of MS Dhoni’s future in the Indian side post the 2019 ODI World Cup. But Prasad said there is no doubt in anyone’s mind about the former India captain’s future.

“I don’t really see any ambiguity. MS is clear about his future which he expressed to me and the team management. I cannot disclose details as it is confidential. It’s best that whatever discussed and shared between us [selection committee and the team management] remains there. It’s an unwritten code,” said Prasad.

“There are plenty of great selections that we can talk of like Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya coming into the Test team. From nowhere, we brought in Rishabh Pant. He was nowhere in contention. We groomed him through India ‘A’ tours. Nobody expected he’ll do so well,” added Prasad when asked about the selections he is proud of."

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 15:34 IST

Four wins out of four paints a commanding picture, but, look closer at the performance of the Indian team at the ongoing ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, and what emerges are closely-fought games where a missed chance in the field could have been the difference between victory and defeat.

And these are chances that just a couple of years back the Indian team missed routinely; while Shafali Verma’s dazzling batting and Poonam Yadav’s mesmeric leg spin has drawn all the attention, it’s India’s drastically improved fielding that’s gone under the radar.

India’s wins en route to the final (on March 8, against Australia) have all come in relatively low scoring encounters—the rest of the batting line up have not kept up with Verma. It’s a combination of incisive bowling and sharp fielding that suffocated the opponents as they tried to chase—Australia faltered chasing 132 in the opening game, and New Zealand could not get to 133.

Even when India bowled first in their last league match, against Sri Lanka, it was the fielding which proved to be the difference. India pulled off some really good catches with Veda Krishnamurthy leading the way with two fine efforts in the deep to derail Sri Lanka’s middle-order and restrict them to 113.

In contrast, Sri Lanka dropped India’s top-scorer Verma twice.

“Their (India players) average height and limb length is much shorter than the players from teams like Australia, England and South Africa, but they are now negating their physical advantage with superior technique, the way we position ourselves and how we dive and slide,” says Biju George, who was the fielding coach of the women’s team from 2017 to November 2019, and largely credited for changing the fielding culture in the team.

“Most of all, it’s the attitude in the field. Our players are now ‘like we own the turf and you are not going to go past us’,” adds Biju, who is now the fielding coach for Sunrisers Hyderabad.

It’s not just that players from Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are taller or stronger, they also came through a far better system, with their training centres treating fitness protocols for men and women cricketers with equal emphasis.

To right these imbalances, coach WV Raman planned four camps since last June, with a focus on strength and speed work. The first camp was of 20 days, then two of 10 days each, and final one 10 days before the World Cup.

Earlier, says Biju, some of the women players’ throws from the boundary would not reach, but now some, like Deepti Sharma, throw as hard as anyone, including male players.

“Deepti is the best thrower in the world, I have coached some IPL teams and her throw is as hard as anybody,” he says. “You can’t take a second run on her throw.”

Agility too has improved by leaps—Jemimah Rodrigues and Smriti Mandhana have been especially impressive—their athleticism on the field a result of sprint training.

“Veda dives well and moves well,” Biju points out. “Jemimah is a livewire; she is very alert to the situation and quick in the field. She also has a very good throw. Mandhana covers so much distance, and I have never seen her drop a catch. Radhav Yadav tries very hard, is very versatile and can field at any position.”

But perhaps the best of the lot is 22-year-old Taniya Bhatia behind the stumps, a woman who, with six catches and three stumpings—the highest in the tournament—played a crucial role in India’s four wins.

“Taniya has quick hands, gathers well with soft palms and moves well,” Biju says. “She is good standing up to the spinners as well as pacers.”

There is another aspect to India’s fielding performance, and that’s the tactical acumen of their captain Harmanpreet Kaur.

“Harmanpreet’s field setting is brilliant. She gets the right player in the right position,” says Biju. “For example, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, who is a left-hander, is at backward point, and I saw her taking a good catch against Australia (opener Beth Mooney). Poonam Yadav is comparatively shorter, so she is positioned at short square-leg.

“India has the potential to be the best fielding side in the world”.

Biju, who knows the team as well as anyone, also feels that they will be unstoppable in the final.

“We are going to win this World Cup…100 per cent,” he says. “ Harmanpreet and Mandhana are due for a big scores and these two will get us through in the finals.”"

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 08:42 IST

The man dressed in pre-wedding finery is seated on a silver throne in the lounge of a hotel in Rajkot. He is trying out various smiles. But when Jaydev Unadkat walks by, the groom-to-be turns his gaze from the wedding photographer and peers at the cricketer hunched over the reception counter.

“Aa koi celebrity che (this is someone famous),” he says to his large family sprawled over the adjacent sofas of purple felt. They watch as Unadkat exits the reception area and disappears into the hotel elevator.

“Mane nathi khabar (I don’t know),” replies a family member from the sofa. The groom-to-be shrugs and returns his gaze and a fresh grin to the camera.

Suspicions of a similar nature are aroused often in Unadkat’s vicinity, during his interview across multiple locations in Rajkot. Presumably, when the fast bowler is not in the pink of Rajasthan Royals or the blue of India or even the first-class whites of Saurashtra—the team he has led into its second straight Ranji Trophy final—he is akin to Clark Kent loitering about the newsroom of Daily Planet.

Although Unadkat couldn’t care less about the excesses that come with his job, such as fame or the lack of it, the 28-year-old fast bowler from Porbandar has been forcing the wider world of cricket to open its eyes and recognise him—and his immense potential—at least when he has his costume on.

In his avatar of a cricketer this domestic season, Unadkat’s performances have been nothing short of superhuman. In the nine matches that Saurashtra has played in this Ranji Trophy, the left-arm seamer has taken 65 wickets, at an average of 12.16 per wicket. That’s already three wickets more than Karnataka’s Dodda Ganesh took in the 1998-99 season, breaking the long-standing record of 62 wickets for a pacer in a single Ranji season; and just three wickets shy of the all-time record of 68 wickets, set in the previous season by Bihar’s left-arm spinner Ashutosh Aman.

Saurashtras Captain Jaydev Unadkat ( Prakash Parsekar )

“See, setting records has not been my motivation this season,” says Unadkat, two days before the semifinal against Gujarat, at a time when he has a tally of 55 wickets and is still a distance away from Ganesh. “Milestones are fine. But my motivation has been to bowl that penetrative spell, where I break a crucial partnership and turn things around for the team. That’s all I have wanted to do so far. That’s all I wish to do in the next match against Gujarat.”

Unadkat from the pavilion end

On the final day of a wildly fluctuating semi-final in Rajkot, Gujarat find themselves pretty close to chasing down Saurashtra’s target of 326. The equation is simple enough for the visitors: 120 runs from the last session of the contest with two batsmen batting in the 80s. Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel (88 not out) and Chirag Gandhi (82 not out) had scored at a rate of over four runs an over in the previous session.

Unadkat bowls the first over of the final session on Rajkot’s infamously flat pitch (where fast bowlers come to die—in January, Mitchell Starc posted his careers worst figures here, conceding 78 runs in 10 overs without a wicket) and is promptly struck for three boundaries. The hits take both batsmen into the 90s.

Saurashtra hasn’t taken a wicket in 42 overs, and Unadkat hasn’t taken a wicket since the 15th over of the innings when he returns for the second over of his spell. Instantly, the leather spits up at Patel from a length and the outside edge is snatched up by second slip. Out walks Patel and in walks another Patel who has played for India. First ball, and Axar Patel spoons a low return catch to Unadkat, which the bowler holds on to. In his next over he bowls out Gandhi for 96. And in the over after that Unadkat takes out Gujarat’s No.11 to end their innings and campaign. It is Unadkat’s fourth wicket of the session, the seventh in the innings, and tenth of the match. But as he would like to put it, it is simply the wicket that takes Saurashtra to the final, nothing less, nothing more.

Take a sad song, and make it better

‘Penetrative spell’, ‘break a crucial partnership’, ‘turns things around for the team’—check, check and check.

“The joy of getting a five-for and raising the ball to the dressing room is a real high,” says Unadkat. “But I will happily give away all that and my tag of being highest wicket-taker as well to get my hands around the trophy. Anything else besides winning that, the first Ranji title for Saurashtra, can take a side.”

Because the final, like the semi-final, will be held at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, the odds of breaking records and lifting the trophy together are pretty high for Unadkat. The name of this cricket ground should ideally strike doom into the heart of a fast bowler, even if it is his home ground, or especially if that is so.

But mention the SCA Stadium to Unadkat, and watch it take him to his warm and fuzzy place. Why? Since the new ground in Rajkot opened for business in 2013, Unadkat has averaged 17.7 here in first-class cricket, while all other pacers put together have averaged 38.8. If these numbers (courtesy ESPNCricinfo) don’t make you believe in the genius of Unadkat, you are either dead inside or a national selector.

“I understand that not many watch domestic cricket in India and only those who do will be able to appreciate what I have achieved in Rajkot,” he says softly. “Yes, at times bowling here has been hard. What really drove me was this notion that only spinners can win matches for Saurashtra. Whenever I heard that, I used to get very offended as a fast bowler.”

Unadkat says this with a chuckle and instantly pauses with practiced abruptness. Then he adds: “But I think if you can inspire yourself to bowl your heart out on this track, you won’t give up on any other track in India. Or, for that matter, anywhere else in the world.”

This above quote is the very essence of Unadkat the cricketer—one who takes the very worst of what the game throws at him and somehow makes it better.

Not seen as a T20 bowler? No problem, he’ll find a way to become the only bowler from IPL’s top-40 wicket-takers to have claimed two five-fors. Picked as a back-up option on his base price for an IPL franchise and not given a go in the first three games? No problem, he’ll still take 24 wickets and drag the side into the final. Dropped after being the highest wicket-taker for a fast bowler in a T20I tri-series and never picked again? No problem, he’ll just focus on being the best domestic bowler he can be.

Disappointment is a simply a fuel for Unadkat. It explains his numerous comebacks and also why he refuses to roll over even in worst-case scenarios. To understand him, then, is to understand his disappointments. And the largest dose of it came at the very beginning of his career. On one morning just after his teens, he was receiving his first India cap; three days later, he had a fuel source for life.

A beginning, an end

Unadkat has large, expressive eyes that often tend to give away what he’s thinking even as his mind processes placid answers. When he is talking about the year 2010, there is an unmistakable sparkle in his pupils, even if his tone is bone dry. It was, after all, the year that saw him play the Under-19 World Cup in January, and by June he had made a dream first-class debut in Leicester, taking an incredible haul of 13 wickets for India A against West Indies A.

The year kept getting better. By July 2010, Unadkat was a net bowler with the Indian Test team. In October, the month of his 20th birthday, Unadkat was part of India’s Test squad against the visiting Australians and beamed with pride as his friend and ally, Cheteshwar Pujara, made his debut. Two months on, in December, he was told on the morning of a Test match in Centurion that he too would be a Test player.

“What can I say? It was all really overwhelming. Not just for me, but for my family also. Nothing like this had happened to anyone we know in Porbandar. Just the previous year I was preparing for my 12th Standard exams, which was important to me because my father was a teacher in a polytechnic college,” says Unadkat. “Then all of that happened in one go. And to be honest, I can still remember everything even though everything was happening so fast. I just went with the flow.”

The flow involved Zaheer Khan pulling out a day before the Centurion Test and a direct toss-up between Unadkat and Umesh Yadav to make a debut. “I did have a feeling that it will be me because I’m a left armer as well. But even when I went to sleep the night before the Test, there was no official word.

“Morning of the game, Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) told me I will be playing. But there’s a funny story there,” he says. “He gave me a choice. Do I want my test cap from Sachin (Tendulkar) paaji, Rahul (Dravid) bhai, VVS (Laxman) bhai or Viru (Sehwag) bhai? And they were all watching me and I was given five seconds to decide. That was probably the most difficult choice that I’ve ever had to make.”

He chose Tendulkar: “Getting that cap from him was the best moment of my career.” But best moments seldom last long. For Unadkat it certainly didn’t. South Africa chose to field first on a rain-soaked day and India was bowled out for 136. In response, South Africa scored 620 runs for four wickets. Jacques Kallis got to his maiden double hundred, AB de Villiers scored the fastest Test hundred for his country and three Indian bowlers in Ishant Sharma, Harbhajan Singh and Unadkat each conceded over a hundred runs (S Sreesanth went for 97).

The rest of those bowlers featured in the next Test in Durban, which India won. Unadkat wasn’t just dropped for Durban—which would be understandable—he hasn’t been looked at as a Test match prospect since. One bowling innings and that was that.

“Honestly, once things started going differently from how I had planned my debut to go, I started thinking ‘Why now? Why today of all days?’” he says. The glint is gone from his eyes, but his voice papers over the sadness. “I obviously was raw at that time and that can be a plus point at times. But what happened was I was so raw I didn’t know how to deal with such a situation. All I can say is today I have the skills to do things differently when things are not happening for me out in the middle.”

Unadkat is often asked if he has paid too heavy a price for one bowling innings.

“It hasn’t been unfair, if you look at what all has happened in Indian cricket after that,” he says. “There were times—say after three, four years after that happened—when I was really bowling well and had an outstanding season. But even at those times, there were pacers in India bowling just as well as me, if not better.”

Those quicks coming up the ranks are today not only the core pace group of the Indian cricket team; they could well be the best pace attack in the world. “We are all witnessing the greatest era of Indian fast bowling,” says Unadkat. “That, I would say, is a very good thing because it makes us all step up and be the very best that we can.”

Coming back to life

In January 2019, while India’s pace attack added a new dimension to its legacy in Australia, Unadkat was breaking new ground too, back home with Saurashtra. Handed over the captaincy of the side mid-way through the season, Unadkat led the team into the Ranji Trophy final, which they lost to defending champions Vidarbha. Still, his fluent leadership came as a surprise to everyone except Unadkat.

“I was sort of natural at it because I practiced being a leader even when I was a kid,” he says. Growing up in Porbandar, cricket-mad Unadkat used to organise games and rally his group to come play at the local Chowpatty ground. To ensure they show up, he bought all the requisite cricket gear. And to ensure he could play the leader, young Unadkat would lure all the players over to his house for ‘team meetings’.

“I used to tell my mother to prepare all their favourite dishes,” he says, laughing. “And then when they came over for dinner, I would discuss strategy and field settings for the upcoming game.”

When the Saurashtra gig came to him, Unadkat played leader again, going out of his way to shake things up. “That was important, because when a team has a similar sort of structure for a long period of time, you know, people start taking things for granted. Some bad routines do come in as well,” he says. “I don’t really like to say a lot of things about how I lead. But the foundation to my captaincy is simple: see the dressing room from the perspective of every player in it.”

Saurashtra’s performances since he took over should alone tell you that the home dressing room in Rajkot is a happy place.

“That’s all I wanted to do as a as a captain, you know, to create an environment where people actually feel for the team at a personal level and not just on a professional level,” he says. “I have played in zonal matches where you don’t enjoy your success much because there is no real team environment. But in this team, we celebrate each other’s success more than our own.”

Steeped in mirth, this environment has been conducive to Unadkat’s growth as well. Last season, his first as captain, Unadkat took 39 wickets, then his season-best haul. Now, he has 114 Ranji wickets in two seasons, with a game still to go. “It looks like I am leading from the front. But the truth is all of us in the team are leaders and we are all responsible for so many things,” says Unadkat. “This process of building a team has helped my bowling the most. Life, I would say, is very good now.”

Life has been kind to Unadkat beyond first-class cricket as well. Following his sensational IPL season in 2017 for Rising Pune Supergiants, where he was picked up for his base price of Rs 30 lakh and went on to claim 24 wickets (including a five-for and a hattrick), Unadkat was paid Rs 19.90 crore over two auctions—in 2018 and 2019—by Rajasthan Royals.

Speaking of those auctions makes Unadkat visibly uncomfortable, especially because the pressure of his price tag didn’t help with his performances in either of those two seasons. “It did affect me at some level. And it is bound to because wherever I went, people looked at me from that angle of highest earner,” he says in a low voice, as a basic courtesy to the other patrons in the restaurant.

Once his wickets started drying up, Unadkat’s value was questioned by all and sundry. “I don’t blame the fans or the media, to be honest. Because even some from the cricketing fraternity… they talk just like that,” he says. “And then, apart from all those external pressures, there was the pressure I put on myself too. After a couple of bad games in 2018, I was telling myself: ‘you can’t afford to have bad games now’.”

But surely away from the cricket field, the money from the two auctions has helped him lead a more comfortable life? “Not really, no. I had enough money in my bank account even before that to lead a good life. So, it didn’t really matter,” says Unadkat, clicking his tongue. “For the record, I’m still driving the same car from seven years ago. I’m still living in the same house in Porbandar. I still buy the same clothes I used to buy, from the same stores.”

This isn’t him paying lip service; Unadkat is simply stating it as it is—he’s in everyday clothes in an everyday restaurant and speaking slightly louder than a whisper, so as to not disturb the young couple seated on the table beside ours.

Shortly after the conversation on his wealth, Unadkat receives a phone call and excuses himself.

“Sorry about that, it couldn’t wait,” he says after the call ends. “A bunch of my friends from the Gujarat team are meeting me for dinner. I had to make arrangements for them.”"

Saha was recently part of the Indian team which lost against New Zealand 0-2 in the Test series. Saha, however, failed to get a chance to play in either of the two Tests as Rishabh Pant took over the role behind the stumps.

The inclusion of Pant over Saha didn’t go down well with few former India cricketers and they slammed the decision to keep ‘team’s best wicket-keeper’ out of the XI in New Zealand.

“Purely on wicketkeeping skills for a Test match, Saha is a better choice. If you compare the batting aspect, Pant can change the complexion of a game. So, playing Pant was not a bad idea. I wouldn’t say it was a disaster. He didn’t do anything wrong behind the stumps,” former India kieeper Farokh Engineer was quoted as saying by Mid-day.

“He [Pant] kept getting beaten. He had to save the Test but at the same time, also needed to get some runs. Had he tried to be flashy, he would have been ostracised for throwing away his wicket. The poor chap was in a dilemma. But when he was at sea, that’s when he should have tried to get behind the ball and play some shots. If I was captain, I would have told him to play his natural game more. He was playing an unnatural game,” he added.

Nayan Mongia, who also kept wickets for India in both Tests and ODIs, had a clear favourite when it came to choosing between Pant and Saha as he insisted that the wicket-keeper position should be kept for a specialist.

“I have always maintained that if Saha is fit and performing, he should be playing in Tests. I have no second thoughts about this. It looks like the team management is looking for a batsman more than a wicketkeeper. Wicketkeeping is a specialist job in Test matches whether it is the spin or pace-friendly situation,” Mongia said.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 08:45 IST

Former India cricketer and batting coach Sanjay Bangar said on Thursday that India Women’s dashing opener Shafali Verma, who has lit up the T20 World Cup in Australia with her spectacular strokeplay, has provided a fresh perspective on how the shortest format should be played in women’s circuit

“You obviously watch which areas a particular batsman/batter tends to score, anybody scoring through the off-side really well means that the person can score all around the park. That is the basic logic because to play through the off-side you have to get into great positions and a lot of mechanics of batting have to be in sync to do that,” said Bangar, who will be playing for India Legends at the Road Safety World Series starting on Saturday, while talking about Shafali’s adroit strokes over the in-field on the off-side as well as through the cover region.

“Shafali has been able to do that, and she scores all around the park—that is one quality which not many people have. It is brilliant that we have unearthed such a talent and it has only taken the load off, or provided a fresh perspective to how T20 needs to be played by women cricketers,” he said.

Bangar said the league stage showcased the depth of talent in the women’s team. “They have been fabulous. Winning four league games out of the four they had to play and the manner in which they won… there is new and young talent emerging which is also performing for the team. Getting to this stage without a big performance from someone like Smriti Mandhana or Harmanpreet Kaur shows the depth which the team possesses. Also, going Down Under and spinners dominating for the Indian team has been a great sign—that has been our area of strength.”

“It augurs well; we finished highest in the table, we got the distinct advantage and rightfully so to qualify for the final, so from that perspective things look really good for the Indian team,” he said.

Bangar said women cricketers have grown stronger and fitter, which has reflected in their fielding standards as well. “The BCCI has taken a lot of effort in sort of streamlining women’s cricket in India. Players are getting more professional because of that, they have access to all facilities; they have access to the NCA (Bengaluru) all the time,” he said.

“From that perspective a lot of things have been done by the board for the growth of women’s cricket and it is just a fall out of that which you see now—the women cricketers are getting stronger and fitter. Once you get stronger and fitter, the area that immediately improves is fielding because that is one basic parameter. A lot of work has gone into it and the framework that we now have for female cricketers is as good as for the male players,” he said."

Updated: Mar 06, 2020 21:25 IST

The World Cup of shooting became the first major sporting event in India to be postponed due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak but the Indian Premier League looks set to roll out as planned in Mumbai on March 29. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sourav Ganguly told PTI on Friday that all “preventive measures” will be in place to ensure that neither the players nor fans are impacted by the fast-spreading health crisis.

“The IPL is very much on. Everywhere, the tournaments are going on. England are already in Sri Lanka. South Africa are here. There are no issues,” he said. “County teams are travelling all over the world. They are travelling to Abu Dhabi, UAE to play. So there is no problem,” he added.

Asked about the precautionary measures to ensure players and fans are not affected, Ganguly said a medical team is thrashing out the specifics. “We will take all precautions. I don’t know what exactly are the measures. The medical team will tell us about that,” he said.

It has been learned that the BCCI has reached out to the sports ministry before they issue any advisory to all stakeholders. Officials say they have no plans to send guidelines other than any advice they receive from the government at this stage. “At this stage there is no need to panic. All standard guidelines which are shared by the health ministry will be passed on to all stakeholders—the franchises, the broadcast crew, commentators etc,” a BCCI medical professional said.

The franchises are awaiting guidelines from the BCCI which will be shared with their overseas players. “Many of our overseas players are inquiring if their travel will be safe and whether there will be visa issues. If they are carrying any common cough and cold symptoms and need to be quarantined, what happens then?” asked a franchise official.

According to the latest advisory, all foreign and Indian nationals entering India from any port, are required to furnish duly filled self-declaration form including personal particulars and travel history to health officials and immigration officials at all ports. The BCCI however is clear public health safety measures will have to be followed in case a player shows symptoms during screening at ports of entry. “They would be quarantined and tested further. One would have to respect that. We are keeping a tab on developments as things evolve,” said an official.

There is no talk of issuing any public safety guidelines for spectators or putting out restrictions on players’ celebrations from the BCCI. Doctors however are already advising people to avoid mass gatherings. “Ideally mass gatherings should be avoided when there is a disease outbreak. If you must, then take certain precautions such as maintaining three to six feet distance from a sick person, wear N-95 mask properly, maintain hand hygiene and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Medicity Hospital."

The novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the US government's top infectious-disease specialist has said the pathogen is 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.

More than 126,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,624 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 74 as on Thursday. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection in the country.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 14:02 IST

The UK Budget tabled by Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to make the cost of long-term visas to Britain higher with a major hike in the compulsory health fee charged on migrants from countries, including India.

Sunak, born in the UK to a general practitioner father and pharmacist mother, announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) would be hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds.

“Migrants benefit from our NHS (National Health Service). And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.

The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.

The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.

The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.

Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.

“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.

“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.

Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:11 IST

South Carolina education officials have agreed not to enforce part of their own state law that bans sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual ones - unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases.

Civil rights groups last month sued the state, saying the law violated the U.S. Constitution. They also say it led to a hostile classroom climate that fostered bullying of students who are not heterosexual.

A federal judge on Wednesday signed a consent agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the state, in which both sides agree not to punish teachers who violate the law. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman now has 60 days to inform all of South Carolina’s public school superintendents of the deal, and the order that they must no longer follow the requirement.

The law states that any teacher who allows “a discussion of alternate sexual lifestyles” including “homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexually transmitted diseases” can be fired.

In the agreement, South Carolina conceded that its law “is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest” and would fail any level of judicial review under the Equal Protection Clause. The judge also barred state officials from enforcing or applying the requirement on teachers.

State officials had no immediate comment Wednesday, but told the judge in court papers that the agreement forged Wednesday is in the public interest. The deal is fair and reasonable, given the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, both sides said in requesting the deal. The South Carolina Attorney General’s Office had earlier issued an opinion that a court would likely conclude the law violates the Constitution.

The consortium of civil rights groups who filed suit said that one-sided sex education classes stigmatize non-heterosexual students —- a group already at a heightened risk of suicide.

Their lawsuit recounted the experience of one student from Greenville. He was in middle school when a classmate threw a Clorox wipe at him and “told him that he was diseased and that the stairway to hell was ‘rainbow-colored.’“ The classmate then kicked him in the chest.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Veteran Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal is drawing a lot of flak on social media after he dropped a simple catch during the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL).

Kamran plays for Peshawar Zalmi and in their match against Quetta Gladiators on Thursday night, Kamran dropped a sitter sending social media in a tizzy with fans questioning his acumen.

During the penultimate over of Quetta’s chase, tailender Sohail Khan skied one off Hasan Ali. Kamran ran to his right settling nicely under the ball only to see it graze his gloves and hit the ground. The team needed an improbable 50 runs from 10 balls.

Afghanistan beat Ireland in their first of three Twenty20s on Friday as Najibullah Zadran smashed an unbeaten 42 in a rain-affected fixture in India.

Ireland, in their 1,000th “capped” match since 1855, made 172 for six as Paul Stirling smashed a quick-fire 60 and fellow opener Kevin O’Brien 35.

Indian Premier League spin star Rashid Khan took three wickets as he restricted the Irish after Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Shapoor Zadran leaked runs.

Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz got Afghanistan off to a solid start before offspinner Simi Singh had both leg before for 23 and 28 respectively.

Karim Janat and Asghar Afghan were run out cheaply but Samiullah Shinwari and Shapoor Zadran steadied the ship before rain halted play at 133 for 5 off 15 overs.

This was enough for Afghanistan to be adjudicated the winner by 11 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis method.

Injured Ireland quick Mark Adair was replaced for the series by Shane Getkate, the only change to the squad that secured a 1-1 draw in the West Indies in January.

Ireland’s head coach Graham Word was also absent after injuring himself in an accident at home, with Rob Cassell stepping in as acting replacement.

“There’s no shying away from the fact that Afghanistan have had our number in T20 Internationals,” skipper Andrew Balbirnie said before the match.

“I can’t honestly remember the last time we beat them in this format. We’ve certainly got a point to prove against these guys.”

For Afghanistan, left-arm quick Zadran rejoined the squad that includes legspinner Qais Ahmad, 19, who floored a shocked Andre Russell with a bouncer in the recent Big Bash."

New Zealand’s Kim Cotton and Pakistan’s Ahsan Raza were on Friday named on-field umpires for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

Four-time champions Australia will take on first-time finalists India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

The 42-year-old Cotton stood in Australia’s semi-final victory over South Africa at the SCG, with the match in Melbourne set to be her fifth of the tournament, the ICC said in a statement.

“Cotton will be joined on the field by Pakistan umpire Raza who, like his colleague, is standing in the Final for the very first time,” it said. Raza was due to officiate in India’s washed-out semi-final with England, while his experience of India-Australia contests stretches back to the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2017 semi-final.

Supporting the on-field umpires will be West Indies’ Gregory Brathwaite, who will be the TV umpire.

Zimbabwe’s Langton Rusere, on-field official for the 2018 Final, will be fourth umpire this time around while Chris Broad of England will oversee the game as match referee."

Moga is a small town in Punjab that has, in the past, produced several personalities – a Sikh leader, a Bollywood actor, a Punjab chief minister and also one of India’s leading freedom fighters. But Moga wasn’t really home to sporting talent until, in 2017, a girl born within its boundaries showed what she could do with the cricket bat during a 50-over World Cup match in England. And just like that, Moga was on the international cricket map.

In the semi-final of the women’s World Cup against Australia in 2017, Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar did more than just make Moga famous for cricket. She also made the world sit up and notice the women’s game, after her knock of 171 runs ended up taking India to the final.

Even though India lost that final to England at Lord’s – a thriller that was a true advertisement for the game – journalists from all over the country descended upon Moga on Harman’s return.

What followed in the years to come was a whirlwind of stardom, endorsements, an Arjuna Award and captaincy of the Indian cricket team. There were controversies too, but with her unique on-field swagger and achievements, Harman had established herself as the face of the sport. “Harman was always different. She would hit big sixes. Attack the bowlers. Take mind blowing catches. A livewire on the field,” says former India captain Anjum Chopra. “And what her knock of 171 against Australia did to the sport is extraordinary. She scored those runs with an injured finger and in great pain.”

Coaxed into hockey at a young age, it is said that Harman told her father, Harmander Singh, a clerk in the local district court, that she wanted to swap the stick for a bat.

“She always had a spark when it came to cricket. She would play against boys and even smash them around the park,” says her father, who now lives in a big house in Moga, which his daughter built for her parents in 2014.

The nearby Gian Jyoti Public School in Moga also played an important role in Harman’s upbringing. The principal of the school, Kamaleesh Sodhi, spotted Harman at a local ground and decided to give her a platform to bloom, free of cost. She then graduated to the state team of Punjab, and two seasons later she was in the Indian team.

“Harman was nervous coming into the team from a small town,” says former India pacer, Amita Sharma, who now coaches the Delhi women’s team. “But look at her confidence now. She is doing well as a captain. She has the faith of all team members and leads from the front.”

Harman became the first Indian cricketer, male or female, to be roped in by a foreign T20 league, when as many as three Women’s Big Bash League teams came calling to sign the aggressive middle order bat in 2015. She ended up with the inaugural champions, Sydney Thunder.

Months later, the T20 captain became the first Indian to sign up with Surrey Stars for the second edition of ECB’s Women’s Cricket League.

But just when life couldn’t get any better for Harman, the ugly side of fame struck. In 2018, she had a much publicised spat with Tushar Arothe, the then coach of the women’s team, which led to Arothe’s resignation just before the T20 World Cup in the West Indies. Things got even worse during that tournament in the Caribbean, when it was reported that Harman, along with new coach, Ramesh Powar, had a falling out with ODI captain, Mithali Raj, which led to Raj being dropped from the playing eleven for the semi-finals.

Yet Harman turned it around; the team she has built as a captain is young, spirited, and play their cricket with a joy and confidence never seen before. It is a team built in her image. Despite failing with the bat herself, she has taken the team to another T20 World Cup semi-final without losing a single match en route.

“She is a real role model,” says all-rounder Harleen Deol, who is part of the Indian team taking part in the ongoing T20 World Cup in Australia. “She gives space to everyone and lets the player play freely.”

ON SOLID GROUND

Harman’s favourite cricketer is Virender Sehwag.

She once wore the number 84 on her jersey, which her father did not approve of because it was the year of the anti-Sikh riots.

Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has appointed Harman a deputy superintendent in the Punjab Police.

She has credited her consistency to keeping a regular diary."

England all-rounder Ben Stokes hit back at former Australia bowler Mitchell Johnson after the latter took a jibe at the ‘Three Lions’ recently. Johnson made an unsavoury remark on social media, involving Stokes, after it was revealed England cricketers won’t shake hands with their counterparts in their upcoming two-match Test series against Sri Lanka.

Johnson referred to the infamous Bristol brawl to take a dig at Stokes, where the all-rounder was initially charged by the police before being acquitted. Johnson started the feud by writing in his Instagram story (as per Daily Telegraph): “Is this a p*** take? You can jam your fist pump England hahahaha just be careful though, Stokesy might react with a sucker punch.”

Stokes took note of this comment and responded by using England’s loyal fanbase Barmy Army’s infamous chant to get under the skin of Johnson during the 2009 Ashes series. Stokes’ Twitter post read: “Bowl’s to the left bowls to the right I wonder if big bad Mitch likes Marmite.”

Amid concerns related to coronavirus, skipper Joe Root stated his team will not go for fair play handshakes on their tour of Sri Lanka. The skipper stated that the players would be greeting each other with fist bumps instead. This came in the aftermath of England players being hit by gastroenteritis and flu problems on their tour of South Africa recently.

“After the illnesses that swept through the squad in South Africa, we are well aware of the importance of keeping contact to a minimum and we’ve been given some really sound and sensible advice from our medical team to help prevent spreading germs and bacteria,” Root was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

Former cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting found their respective names in the line-up as out-of-favour India spinner Harbhajan Singh named his all-time Test XI recently. Harbhajan, who will next be seen donning the yellow of Chennai Super Kings in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), was asked to assemble a team who according to him could be the best XI in the longest format.

Also Read: 6, 6, 6, 6, 6! Dhoni lights up Chepauk ahead of awaited comeback - WATCH

Harbhajan started by picking Virender Sehwag and Matthew Hayden as the openers. Sehwag is regarded as one of the best top-order batsmen in the history of Test cricket and he has got two triple tons to attest that fact. With 8625 runs and a highest score of 380, not many would argue with Hayden’s inclusion either.

Harbhajan handed over the crucial number three and four spots to former teammates Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar respectively. Dravid’s credentials at three is second to none while Tendulkar’s numbers speak for themselves.

Former South Africa cricket Jacques Kallis comes after Tendulkar to take up the all-rounder’s role. With 13289 runs and 292 wickets in the longest format, Kallis will surely go down as one of the best all-rounders, if not the best.

Ricky Ponting oversaw some of the best moments in Australian cricket and no doubt was picked by Harbhajan as the captain of this side. The off-spinner revealed Ponting pipped the likes of Brian Lara, Virat Kohli and Kevin Pietersen for a spot in his team.

The wicket-keeping role was given to Kumar Sangakkara, who has 12400 runs to his name in the longest format. “Adam Gilchrist was a great player but Sangakkara’s record speaks for itself. He averaged 57 in Tests and it would have been a lot more had he not also been a wicket-keeper in the first part of his career.”

20 sixes and six fours in an innings. No that is not the entire team’s stat but Hardik Pandya’s boundary count at the end of the first innings of DY Patil T20 Cup semi-final on Friday. The India all-rounder continued his destructive form on return from injury by slamming an unbeaten 158 off just 55 balls for Reliance 1 against BPCL the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai on Friday.

Hardik Pandya, who is playing his first competitive tournament in five months, hit as many as 20 sixes in a blistering innings coming to bat at No.4 for Reliance 1. Hardik also hit six fours in his knock providing entertained the crowd who had turned up to see the likes of him, Shikhar Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shreyas Iyer among others.

Hardik’s superlative innings, which came days after he had smashed 105 off 39 balls in the same tournament, propelled his side to 238 for 4, batting first.

Hardik underwent a surgery after suffering a lower-back injury five months ago and has since been on a road to recovery. He could not be fit in time for the New Zealand tour but started bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after returning from a check-up in UK.

After smashing 105 against CAG in a Group C encounter few days ago, he had said: “It’s fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone,” Hardik said on DY Patil Sports Academy Facebook page.

On his big-hitting prowess, the 26-year old added: “If it’s there in my arc I just back myself and go for it. Most of the times, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”

Updated: Mar 06, 2020 16:00 IST

Experienced middle-order batter Veda Krishnamurthy believes that “destiny” is in favour of first-time finalist India to win their maiden ICC Women’s T20 World Cup title provided they get a grip on their nerves in the summit clash against Australia here on Sunday. India will have a psychological advantage going into the final as they had stunned the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener.

Also Read: ‘Just hate playing India’: Aussie pacer ahead of Women’s T20 WC final

The Harmanpreet Kaur-led India reached the final on the basis of their unbeaten record in the tournament after their semifinal against England was washed out on Thursday.

Krishnamurthy, who was a part of the Indian team that finished runner-up to England in the 2017 Women’s ODI World Cup, knows the pain of missing out on a world title.

“It’s all about destiny, and I’m a big believer in destiny. I feel like this is the way it was meant to be. There is a joke going around that this World Cup is made in such a way that it’s helping us, starting from the wickets to everything else,” she was quoted as saying by the tournament’s official website.

“Being in the final is just reward for the way we played in the group stages. There was an advantage to having won all our games with the weather not in our hands.”

The team’s first target of reaching the final having achieved, the 27-year-old player said the Indians now need to hold their nerves and remain focussed leading up to the big day on Sunday.

“We said the first aim was to get to the final and take it from there. We’ve crossed the first stage. We need to make sure we hold our nerves and we do what we need to do on the final day,” she said.

India’s recent rivalry with Australia has taken fascinating twists and turns, with Kaur’s outfit chasing down 173 in their recent tri-series and getting home by 17 runs in the T20 World Cup opener.

But all is not hunky-dory for Krishnamurthy on the personal front. Considered a great finisher, she has recovered from a series of single-digit scores in the tri-series to score 20 from 11 balls in a finishing role against Bangladesh. Having amassed just 35 runs from four matches in the tournament so far, the Karnataka batter knows her role in the team.

“As an individual, the role given to me is very consistent in the last year. They’ve put effort in the last year to keep me there and I’ve been supported by every individual, not just one or two. The entire team, with all the support staff have shown faith in me,” she said.

“I know coming into the World Cup, I would play a crucial role to finish the innings well, which I felt I was unable to do in the last World Cup in the West Indies,” she added.

Krishnamurthy said specific roles have been set for every player of the squad and they all are trying to contribute as much as they can to help the team achieve its goal.

“I was very motivated to do my role and I’ve been working on that. It’s not just me, all 15 players involved know what their role is,” she said.

“I’m happy we’re all putting in efforts and executing our role properly. Even if it’s a smallish contribution of saving a couple of runs, it’s all panned out really well.”"

With the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League just three weeks away, fans are eagerly awaiting the return of Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni. The former India skipper has been away from cricket since India’s exit from the World Cup last year after losing to New Zealand in the semifinal. The wicketkeeper-batsman is set to make a return for CSK in the IPL, and Dhoni has already started training at the nets at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.

From the video, it remains unclear whether Dhoni is hitting the shots against a bowler or a ball-machine. But hitting five consecutive sixes, either ways, showcases that the cricketer is still capable of smashing big hits and light up Chepauk when the tournament starts on March 29.

Dhoni started his training in Chennai from March 2 along with other players ahead of season 13 of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 38-year old, whose future in the game has been a subject of intense speculation in the past few months, has maintained a stoic silence on what his next move would be. He was dropped from the BCCI’s list of centrally contracted players in January.

Having won a slew of major trophies on foreign shores, champions Australia will look to triumph in front of home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday when they meet maiden finalists India in the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup decider.

Meg Lanning’s Australia, long the benchmark in women’s cricket, will bid for a record-extending fifth T20 World Cup title after a rocky ride to their sixth final.

Beaten by India in their tournament-opener, Australia lost talismanic all-rounder Ellyse Perry to injury in the quarter-finals and prayed for the rain to clear in Sydney on Thursday before completing their semi-final win over South Africa.

Harmanpreet Kaur-captained India arrive at the MCG undefeated and without having bowled a ball in the rained-out semi-final against England.

For organisers, the final is a dream matchup promising a big crowd at the 100,000-capacity stadium and a TV audience of millions tuning in from cricket-crazy India.

Only about 3,000 fans turned up the last time Australia’s women played a global final on home soil, when the hosts beat England for the 1988 one-day World Cup at the MCG.

Former England stalwart Jan Brittin, who played in the match, described the hulking, virtually empty stadium as a “very large and a very lonely place”.

Times have changed, and organisers hope Sunday’s crowd might better the 90,185 that saw the United States beat China on penalties in the 1999 final of the soccer World Cup at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

The Rose Bowl attendance is regarded the biggest ever for a women’s sporting event, though the unofficial 1971 Women’s World Cup final between Mexico and Denmark in Mexico City has long been credited with an apocryphal crowd estimate of 110,000.

Record or not, cheap tickets for general admission, a favourable weather forecast and entertainment by American pop star Katy Perry will at least ensure a buzzing atmosphere for a decider scheduled on International Women’s Day.

The global spread of the coronavirus has seen sports events cancelled or postponed in a slew of countries to try to contain the disease but Australian health authorities are yet to take such measures.

INDIA’S SPIN BOWLING THREAT

Australia will hope the MCG curator has prepared a pitch to blunt India’s spin bowling, especially after the home batswomen were bamboozled by legspinner Poonam Yadav who took 4-19 in the tournament opener at the Sydney Showgrounds.

“Hopefully they’ve prepared something (at the MCG) that will suit us a bit more,” Australia opener Beth Mooney said.

“The Showground probably wasn’t ideal for our batting and bowling.

“But that game is done now. The slate is wiped clean ... it’s about who comes to the party on the day.”

India have proved a thorn in Australia’s side at global tournaments, knocking them out of the semi-finals of the 2017 one-day World Cup and inflicting their only loss during their run to the 2018 T20 World Cup title in the Caribbean.

“We would like to thank the government of Nepal for their support and counsel through this challenging period, and we support entirely the professional advice throughout.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:25 IST

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 14:02 IST

The UK Budget tabled by Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to make the cost of long-term visas to Britain higher with a major hike in the compulsory health fee charged on migrants from countries, including India.

Sunak, born in the UK to a general practitioner father and pharmacist mother, announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) would be hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds.

“Migrants benefit from our NHS (National Health Service). And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.

The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.

The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.

The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.

Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.

“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.

“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.

Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:11 IST

South Carolina education officials have agreed not to enforce part of their own state law that bans sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual ones - unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases.

Civil rights groups last month sued the state, saying the law violated the U.S. Constitution. They also say it led to a hostile classroom climate that fostered bullying of students who are not heterosexual.

A federal judge on Wednesday signed a consent agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the state, in which both sides agree not to punish teachers who violate the law. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman now has 60 days to inform all of South Carolina’s public school superintendents of the deal, and the order that they must no longer follow the requirement.

The law states that any teacher who allows “a discussion of alternate sexual lifestyles” including “homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexually transmitted diseases” can be fired.

In the agreement, South Carolina conceded that its law “is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest” and would fail any level of judicial review under the Equal Protection Clause. The judge also barred state officials from enforcing or applying the requirement on teachers.

State officials had no immediate comment Wednesday, but told the judge in court papers that the agreement forged Wednesday is in the public interest. The deal is fair and reasonable, given the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, both sides said in requesting the deal. The South Carolina Attorney General’s Office had earlier issued an opinion that a court would likely conclude the law violates the Constitution.

The consortium of civil rights groups who filed suit said that one-sided sex education classes stigmatize non-heterosexual students —- a group already at a heightened risk of suicide.

Their lawsuit recounted the experience of one student from Greenville. He was in middle school when a classmate threw a Clorox wipe at him and “told him that he was diseased and that the stairway to hell was ‘rainbow-colored.’“ The classmate then kicked him in the chest.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:57 IST

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:09 IST

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 23:37 IST

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

Updated: Mar 07, 2020 08:48 IST

On a day a resident of New Delhi tested positive for coronavirus, taking the number of infected people in India to 31 (including 16 Italian tourists), BCCI president Sourav Ganguly gave a green signal to the The Indian Premier League (IPL), saying that ‘IPL is very much on’.

“IPL is very much on. Everywhere, the tournaments are going on. England are already in Sri Lanka. South Africa are here. There are no issues,” Ganguly told PTI on Friday.

The glitzy T20 event, featuring both Indian and international stars, gets underway on March 29 in Mumbai with defending champions Mumbai Indians taking on last year’s runner-ups Chennai Super Kings.

“County teams are travelling all over the world. They are travelling to Abu Dhabi, UAE to play. So there is no problem,” he added.

Ganguly, however, asserted that all precautionary measures will be taken so that the players and the spectators don’t get infected with the virus, adding that a medical team is thrashing out the specifics.

“We will take all precautions. I don’t know exactly what are the extra measures. It’s only medical team which will tell us about that. The medical team is already in touch with the hospitals so that everything is available. We will do what the doctors say. They are the professionals.

“All medical issues will be addressed by the medical team. Every tournament will go on,” he added.

The number of people sickened by the rapidly spreading virus was close to 97,000 on Thursday evening, with over 3,300 of these believed to have succumbed to the consequent illness. The pathogen, similar to the Sars virus that spread in 2002-2003, leads to cough, fever and, in serious cases, respiratory distress that can turn fatal.

The virus started spreading in China in late December, but is now recording an exponential spike outside of the country. Iran, South Korea and Italy are among the nations where the outbreak is now most serious.

India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar shared a message for Harmanpreet Kaur & co. as India get ready to play Australia in the final of Women’s T20 World Cup in Melbourne next week on Monday. India reached the final of the tournament for the first time after their semifinal clash against England was washed out. With no reserve day, India qualified for the final, as the tournament rules dictated that the team finishing higher in the group stages will progress further.

Speaking to news agency ANI at an event in Mumbai, Tendulkar, who was part of India’s 2011 World Cup winning campaign, shared an inspiring message for the team.

“Just live in the moment and play the finals. I was there next to the trophy when I was in Australia and few members of our women’s team were there with me. I told them that it would be nice to see you with the trophy back in India,” he said.

“My message to them would be to go out and give your best. I would tell them to not take any pressure. They don’t need to spend time with the outside world. I have watched their performances and they have inspired so many youngsters,” the Master Blaster added.

He further said: “It is about bringing laurels to our nation, so many athletes in different fields have brought laurels to our nation, this would be another one. Go and enjoy yourself.”

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final against defending champions Australia after their last-four clash against England was washed out on Thursday, prompting both captains to say that reserve days are essential for knockout clashes.Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, taking Indians into the summit clash and leaving England players in tears.

India will take on four-time winners Australia, who defeated South Africa by five runs in what was also a rain-hit semifinal match, curtailed to 13 overs after Australia’s innings. The two teams will clash on Sunday, which also happens to be International Women’s Day.

Updated: Mar 06, 2020 12:23 IST

16-year-old India opener Shafali Verma, who recently climbed on top of the T20I batting rankings is already giving nightmares to Australia pacers ahead of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final on Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. So much so that Megan Schutt expressed her concerns over facing her once again in the big final.

Schutt was hit for 16 runs in an over that included four boundaries - three of them in a row - in the first match of the Women’s T20 World Cup by Shafali Verma.

Schutt, who took a crucial 2/17 in Australia’s five-run win over South Africa in the rain-hit semifinal on Thursday, has still not recovered from the drubbing she got at the hands of Verma in the tournament-opener.

Schutt, who was the No.1-ranked T20I bowler at the start of the tournament (she has now replaced by England’s Sophie Ecclestone) said the Indian openers Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana have got her covered ever since the tri-series, which took place just before the world event.

“Smriti and Shafali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I’ve ever been hit for, Schutt was quoted as saying by the official website of the ICC.

Agreeing that they will come up with better plans to counter the Indian openers in the final on Sunday, Schutt said she might not be best bet to bowl to them in the powerplay.

“There are obviously some plans we’re going to revisit as bowlers. (But) clearly, I’m not the best match-up to those two in the Powerplay. They find me quite easy to play,” she added.

With 161 runs in 4 matches, Shafali Verma is India’s leading run-scorer in the tournament. More than the runs, the manner in which she gets them, has earned praise from all quarters. Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar praised her after India had reached the semi-finals. “Fantastic performance by our Flag of India team to become the first team to enter the semi-final of T20 World Cup. It was a tight game and we played well under pressure. Was great to see Shafali Verma play yet another crucial knock,” Tendulkar had tweeted.

Thank you sir for your kind words and support! I'll keep giving my best for the team sir 🇮🇳🙂 @sachin_rt https://t.co/eFjs352l27 — Shafali Verma (@TheShafaliVerma) February 28, 2020

Shafali’s blistering strokeplay has often drawn comparisons with former opener Virender Sehwag. The man himself had termed her a rockstar a few days earlier.

“Wah bhai Wah ! Great effort by the girls to hold on to their nerves and beat New Zealand and qualify for the semi finals of the T20 World Cup. Shafali Verma is a rockstar. Anand aa raha hai ladkiyon ka performance dekhne mein,” tweeted Virender Sehwag.

India will face Australia in Sunday’s summit clash, where India will have an edge after stunning the defending champions by 17 runs in the tournament opener."

Australia fast bowler Megan Schutt is ruing the prospect of playing against India in the final of the Women’s T20 World Cup. Australia defeated South Africa in a rain-curtailed match by 5 runs (DLS method). Schutt starred in Australia’s win, as she picked up 2 wickets and gave just 17 runs in her spell to restrict South Africa in the chase. But ahead of the World Cup final, scheduled to take place on Sunday, the Aussie pacer recalled the drubbing she received in the tournament opener when she was struck for four boundaries in the opening over by Shafali Verma.

“I just hate playing India - they’ve got the wood over me,” Schutt was quoted as saying by the official ICC website. “Smriti and Shefali have got me covered. That six Shafali hit me for in the tri-series was probably the biggest one I’ve ever been hit for,” she said.

The bowler went on to add that she will prepare to challenge Indian batswomen, but added that she is not a match-up to Indian openers in the powerplay overs. “There are obviously some plans we’re going to revisit as bowlers. (But) clearly, I’m not the best match-up to those two in the Powerplay. They find me quite easy to play,” she said.

Speaking about the final, Schutt described it as a big challenge to face India. “We’re at that final we’ve been talking about for so long and against India, which is super fitting considering the tri-series we had. It couldn’t really be a bigger challenge for us,” she said.

India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was denied permission to play in the Ranji Trophy final for Saurashtra against Bengal, which is set to take place on Monday at Rajkot, according to a report. The request was made by Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) to BCCI, but since Jadeja is a part of Indian ODI set-up, and is expected to feature in the upcoming ODI series against South Africa, the BCCI president Sourav Ganguly denied him the permission to play citing “country first” policy.

“I spoke to him [Ganguly] and was told that the board can’t allow Jadeja to play Ranji as country comes first,” Jaydev Shah, the SCA president was quoted as saying by The Indian Express.

“If BCCI wants people to watch their premier domestic cricket then no international game should be held during Ranji final, henceforth. It’s my suggestion. Will BCCI keep an international match during IPL? No, because it gives money. Ranji Trophy can only be popularised if star players play at least in the finals. Don’t keep any international cricket during finals, have a proper window,” Shah further said.

“I would have loved to see him (Jadeja) play the Ranji Trophy final for us, why only Jadeja, I would have loved to see Mohammad Shami (for Bengal) also,” he added.

Saurashtra entered their second successive Ranji Trophy final with a 92-run win over Gujarat on day five of their semifinal, on Wednesday. Saurashtra captain and lead pacer Jaydev Unadkar led from the front with a seven-wicket haul as Gujarat were bowled out for 234 in the final session on day five.

Unadkat also broke a 21-year-old record for most wickets by a fast bowler in a single Ranji Trophy season. He finished the semifinal with a total of 65 wickets. The record earlier belonged to Karnataka’s Dodda Ganesh for the 1998-99 season.

The novel coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the US government's top infectious-disease specialist has said the pathogen is 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu.

More than 126,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,624 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

In India, the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases went up to 74 as on Thursday. The government has suspended most visas including visa-free travel facility extended to Indian-origin foreigners from Friday to 15 April in an effort to stop instances of incoming travellers spreading the infection in the country.

The Supreme Court bench asked the Uttar Pradesh government under which law it publicly pasted the posters of the protesters who demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Highlighting the issue of privacy, Justice UU Lalit said that while the court agrees there should not be unruly behaviour, there must be some law which backs the action of putting up the hoardings. “In this case, there is no backing of law,” said Justice Lalit.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, then presented a precedent set by the court in its 1994 judgement in R Rajagopal vs State of Tamil Nadu on the issue of privacy. He contended that people who resort to violence and point guns during protest cannot claim right to privacy.

The court, however, refused to stay Allahabad High Court judgement ordering removal of these posters but referred the question of law to a larger bench. “The matter requires further elaboration and consideration,” the two-judge bench said.

The court was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging the Allahabad high court’s March 9 order directing it to remove hoardings containing photos and other personal details of people, who allegedly took part in anti-CAA protests.

A high court bench of chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ramesh Sinha had ruled that the state government’s action of erecting the hoardings in Lucknow with personal details of the alleged anti-CAA protestors amounted to an infringement of their privacy.

Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution and the actions of the state government amount to an unwarranted interference with the same, the high court added, while directing authorities to remove the hoardings immediately and submit a compliance report on or before March 16.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on March 5 put up several hoardings across Lucknow, identifying those accused of violence during the protests that took place against the CAA in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused were on the hoardings and triggered concerns over the safety of those who figured on them. The accused were also asked to pay for the damages to public and private property caused during the protests within a stipulated time or have their properties seized.

The high court on March 7 registered a suo motu public interest litigation and asked the district magistrate and police commissioner of Lucknow to give details about the law under which such hoardings were put up.

On March 8, the high court pulled up the state government for putting up such hoardings and termed it as an “insult of state and its public”, “highly unjust” and an “encroachment” on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

The high court also brushed aside the government’s argument that the hoardings were meant to act as a “deterrent” so that such acts are not repeated. It added while the state is entitled to take actions for the maintenance of law and order, it should not come at the cost of fundamental rights of people."

The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested the president of Popular Front of India (PFI) and the organisation’s secretary for allegedly funding the Delhi riots and for conspiracy. Mohammad Iliyas and Parvez Ahmed were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police, an official said.

Ahmed is the Delhi president of PFI, while Iliyas is secretary of the organisation.

The action came a day after Home Minister Amit Shah said in Parliament that two people have been identified for funding the riots in Northeast Delhi. More than 50 people were killed and over 200 injured in last month’s violence.

Iliyas is a resident of Shiv Vihar, also contested in the 2020 Delhi Assembly polls from Karawal Nagar on a ticket from Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI. The ED has registered a case against PFI and suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested after an FIR was registered against him for the murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Hussain’s alleged links with the PFI are also being investigated.

Another PFI member Mohd Danish was earlier arrested in connection with Delhi violence. According to news agency ANI, Danish has told the police that PFI was “deeply involved” in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

Danish has been working with PFI since 2018 and is the general secretary of Trilokpuri area in Delhi.

The Crime Branch of Delhi Police had on Monday arrested Tahir Hussain’s brother Shah Alam. Three other people who had given shelter to Shah Alam have also been arrested. Hussain was sent to seven-day police custody on March 6 in connection with the case. A Delhi court had earlier rejected the anticipatory bail plea of the suspended AAP leader.

In January, the ED said that it identified several bank accounts used for funding over Rs 120 crore for anti-CAA protest across the country."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 11:59 IST

Actor and aspiring politician Rajinikanth said on Thursday that age limit and education are crucial in politics and that he will give new and deserving people a chance in his political party.

Presenting a roadmap for politics in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth said at a press conference in Chennai that he will have a limited number of leaders in his party. He also highlighted the “political vaccum” in Tamil Nadu and acknowledged that there is a need to fill that space.

“I have never thought of the Chief Minister’s post. I only want a change in politics,” news agency ANI quoted Rajinikanth as saying. The Press Trust of India reported that Rajinikanth proposed the appointment of an “educated and compassionate youngster” as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

There is speculation that Rajinikanth will join politics and contest the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, but the actor has so far not made his plans official.

Earlier this month, he had met some leaders from a Muslim outfit at his residence and discussed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with them. Rajinikanth had later said on Twitter that he is ready to play any role to maintain peace in the country.

The actor had also said in the past that he would be the first person to raise voice even if a single Muslim was affected by the CAA.

On December 31, 2017, addressing a packed fan base in Chennai, Rajinikanth had declared, “It’s a war... It’s a war. Get ready for battle,” indicating his intention to enter the political scene in Tamil Nadu which has been bereft of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi after the demise of the iconic leaders.

Initially, the actor had converted his informal fan club into the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) - an association expected to be the base for his political party. The actor had also appointed office bearers and functionaries at various levels for RMM.

In October 2018, Rajinikanth had publicly claimed that 90 per cent of work for launching his party had been completed. But since then everything has suddenly turned quiet on Rajini’s political front."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 14:02 IST

The UK Budget tabled by Indian-origin Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is set to make the cost of long-term visas to Britain higher with a major hike in the compulsory health fee charged on migrants from countries, including India.

Sunak, born in the UK to a general practitioner father and pharmacist mother, announced that the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) would be hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds.

“Migrants benefit from our NHS (National Health Service). And we all want them to do so – but it’s right that what people get out, they also put in,” the 39-year-old Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

“There is a surcharge already, but it doesn’t properly reflect the benefits people receive. So, as we promised in our manifesto, we are increasing the Immigration Health Surcharge to 624 pounds, with a discounted rate for children,” he said.

The hike was expected as it was in the December 2019 General Election manifesto of the Boris Johnson-led government, but its timing is now confirmed as this year. A new discounted rate of 470 pounds has been incorporated for children aged under 18, but the lower rate for international students is also set for a rise -- from 300 pounds to 470 pounds.

The IHS was introduced in April 2015 and from December 2018 it was hiked from 200 pounds to 400 pounds per year. It is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the country’s state-funded NHS.

The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), the UK’s largest representative body for Indian-origin doctors, has been lobbying the UK Home Office for a rethink over the charge as it would have an adverse impact on their attempt to recruit more healthcare professionals from India to meet staff shortages in the NHS.

Indian industry warned that the further hike would mean an added burden on already high visa fees.

“The increase in the health surcharge to 620 pounds will add to the already expensive visa fees for overseas skilled workers. This will be an additional burden on Indian businesses operating in the UK,” said Baroness Usha Prashar, Chair of the UK Council of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

FICCI described the overall Budget as a “balanced and pragmatic” one against the backdrop of the global outbreak of COVID-19.

“Increased investment in R&D (Research and Development) to 22 billion pounds a year and the announcement of 130 million pounds of new funding to extend Startup Loans will give a major boost to innovation and entrepreneurship,” Prashar said.

Referring to the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates, Loknath Mishra, Chair of the Financial Services Committee of FICCI’s UK Council and MD and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Plc, said it was a “timely and proportionate response” to the current crisis posed by the coronavirus crisis. “This announcement will support businesses in these turbulent times to manage their credit flows and better manage their cash flows,” he said. The Bank of England cut its key interest rate by 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Wednesday, as an emergency measure in response to the outbreak of COVID-19."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 13:11 IST

South Carolina education officials have agreed not to enforce part of their own state law that bans sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual ones - unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases.

Civil rights groups last month sued the state, saying the law violated the U.S. Constitution. They also say it led to a hostile classroom climate that fostered bullying of students who are not heterosexual.

A federal judge on Wednesday signed a consent agreement reached between the plaintiffs and the state, in which both sides agree not to punish teachers who violate the law. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman now has 60 days to inform all of South Carolina’s public school superintendents of the deal, and the order that they must no longer follow the requirement.

The law states that any teacher who allows “a discussion of alternate sexual lifestyles” including “homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexually transmitted diseases” can be fired.

In the agreement, South Carolina conceded that its law “is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest” and would fail any level of judicial review under the Equal Protection Clause. The judge also barred state officials from enforcing or applying the requirement on teachers.

State officials had no immediate comment Wednesday, but told the judge in court papers that the agreement forged Wednesday is in the public interest. The deal is fair and reasonable, given the strength of the plaintiffs’ case, both sides said in requesting the deal. The South Carolina Attorney General’s Office had earlier issued an opinion that a court would likely conclude the law violates the Constitution.

The consortium of civil rights groups who filed suit said that one-sided sex education classes stigmatize non-heterosexual students —- a group already at a heightened risk of suicide.

Their lawsuit recounted the experience of one student from Greenville. He was in middle school when a classmate threw a Clorox wipe at him and “told him that he was diseased and that the stairway to hell was ‘rainbow-colored.’“ The classmate then kicked him in the chest.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 10:49 IST

Even as the Congress mounts a bid to preserve its government in Madhya Pradesh after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the resignation of legislators close to him, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is facing internal dissent too over the possible choice of chief minister, in case the Kamal Nath-led Congress government loses its majority in the state assembly.

As many as 22 Congress legislators submitted their resignations to speaker NP Prajapati on Tuesday, putting the Congress in a minority in the assembly.

The BJP, on Tuesday, called a meeting, with speculation that it would pick a new legislative leader, a possible CM, if Nath fails to save his government.

Senior BJP leaders said the legislature party meeting did not take up any agenda, after there was opposition to the possibility of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan getting elected as legislature party chief, replacing Gopal Bhargava.

Ahead of the meeting, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prahlad Singh Patel, Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and other senior leaders met in Delhi to discuss prevailing political atmosphere in the state after Congress MLAs started deserting the party last week.

A BJP leader said, “As Chouhan took the lead and was consulted at various levels in the party, a message percolated to Bhopal that they must be alert.”

Another BJP leader, who is opposed to Chouhan, said there is a sense in the party that other leaders must be given an opportunity as Chouhan has had a chief ministerial tenure for 13 years, and must be held accountable for the 2018 loss. Despite repeated attempts, Chouhan could not be reached for his comments.

However, state BJP media in charge Lokendra Parashar said, “It was nothing but media’s speculations from Delhi to Bhopal about such a coronation. The agenda of the meeting was only Rajya Sabha election. No other issue was discussed...”

A BJP leader close to Chouhan said, “When Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister in November 2005 the BJP was plagued with infighting...Chouhan not only checked the infighting, the party ruled the state for 15 years, a record of sort in the state. He is a mass leader and has enough experience to not only run the government but also get every faction of the party along.”

Political analyst Girijashankar said, “Whenever it comes to selecting a leader as the CM in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP central leadership will find it difficult to ignore Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Even if the party picks someone else, it will have to take Chouhan into confidence given his popularity across the state and his command over the administrative issues.”

Central BJP leaders on Wednesday declined to comment on the developments in the state. One functionary however said Chouhan will be the choice to lead the party."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebration of Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through video conference, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday. The PM had postponed visit to Dhaka after coronavirus scare had caused Bangladesh to defer public events beginning March 17.

Shringla told a delegation of 20 Bangladeshi journalists that the PM will also send a video message on the occasion.

A two-day-long special session of the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) to mark Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary will be held from March 22. President Abdul Hamid will deliver his speech on March 22 and Parliament will be prorogued on March 23 with the passage of a resolution on the colourful political life of Bangabandhu.

India had received a formal notification from Bangladesh about public events being deferred because of the detection of coronavirus cases and the larger global public health situation, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said.

This was PM Modi’s second foreign visit to be called off because of Covid-19-related concerns. Last week, India had put off his visit to Brussels for the India-EU Summit on March 13.

Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took several steps to address India’s security concerns and worked assiduously to forge better relations with PM Modi, has faced widespread criticism within Bangladesh since leaders of India’s ruling BJP began talking of deporting all the people left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. She raised the NRC issue with PM Modi during their last two meetings in September and October.

People familiar with developments in Dhaka said there was also anger among younger leaders of Hasina’s Awami League party, who believe the CAA and related issues have strengthened the hands of their opponents in hardline parties. Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who served as the first president of Bangladesh and later as prime minister before his assassination in August 1975.

New Delhi has dismissed criticism of the CAA, saying it’s an internal matter, and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had assured his Bangladeshi interlocutors during a visit to Dhaka this month the NRC had no implications for Bangladesh."

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 08:43 IST

Rana Kapoor, co-founder of YES Bank, sanctioned loans worth Rs30,000 crore, of which those worth Rs 20,000 crore have turned into non-performing assets (NPA) and need to be probed, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday, seeking his custody. The court has granted ED Kapoor’s custody till March 16.

ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Kapoor and his family are linked to 78 companies, which the agency is scanning. He said the agency was checking if the Rs 20,000 crore was diverted to the 78 companies linked to Kapoor and his family and if there was quid pro quo.

The special judge, however, sought documents from the agency to support their claim, to which the agency produced records of forensic audit of the bank.

Kapoor’s lawyer Satish Manashinde objected to the plea, saying when Kapoor left the bank, the NPA account was only 1% of the total loan. He alleged that Kapoor has been made scapegoat. The defence raised questions on searches conducted by the ED at Kapoor’s house much before the case was registered. Manashinde argued that when the ED conducted the searches, the CBI had not registered a case. “Predicate offense was registered much later by the CBI and before that ED began probe and case of ED was registered,” the lawyer contended.

As per law, the ED can begin a probe only after a predicate offence is registered by other agency for financial fraud.

The ED countered the issue and claimed the searches were conducted in respect of case of money laundering against DHFL. The agency said they found material related to money laundering by Kapoor during the searches and hence a separate case was registered later.

Manashinde further contended that when Kapoor left the bank, its condition was much better, but the management which subsequently took over failed. “I can’t be held responsible for the failure of the present management,” Manashinde argued.

Manashinde denied the allegations that Kapoor received kickbacks for giving loans. He added that no bribe was taken. He was highest paid banker and received almost Rs50 crore a year from the bank since 2004 till recently, Manashinde argued, adding he had received awards from various institutions as the best banker. The defence further argued that there cannot be allegations of money laundering in the transactions of bank with DHFL, as the money taken was much prior to the said transaction.

Kapoor’s lawyer argued, “For four months, he was in London and was paying off debts. He was also in talks with the RBI to take over the bank and was meeting with government officers. A week later, a case was registered.”

The agency claimed that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu for it, DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600-crore loan to Doit Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The loan was given without adequate collateral.

The defence said that all the three daughters have given security and they are capable of returning the loan amount of Rs 600 crore and it was never in the form of kickbacks. He also said there are documents to show how the said money is utilised.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), meanwhile, will question key management persons of Yes Bank over the alleged irregularities. “They have to be confronted with the accused. The documents are voluminous and need to be checked,” the agency’s counsel told court. “Under the guise of these loans, funds have been siphoned off. We need to find how the amount travelled,” Gonsalves said."

The Indian Medical Association urged the government on Wednesday not to share novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases daily, arguing the move would lead to panic even though the World Health Organisation declared it a pandemic.

“We appeal to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision. Sharing of data on a daily basis with the public, who are clueless as to what is expected out of them, has created panic,” said IMA in a statement.

“We are trying to calm the peoples’ frayed nerves. The daily sharing of data is creating panic. People are buying masks and hoarding hand sanitisers,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, IMA president.

Public health experts and those who work on the ground are at odds with the IMA’s plea. They said that sharing the right information helps dispel rumours and empowers people to protect themselves against infection.

“When the information of the first [Covid-19] case from Mayur Vihar was reported, we got calls from people, who suspected to have come in contact with the patient. The information helps contact tracing on ground,” said an official from Delhi government on condition of anonymity.

“In this day and age of information, non-disclosure of information is meaningless. Instead, sharing the correct information will make people aware,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital."

Liverpool are set to take on Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield on Wednesday but several Arsenal players are in quarantine after the first postponement of a Premier League game over coronavirus fears.

Jurgen Klopp’s European champions will play the Spanish side in front of more than 50,000 fans in the northwest of England despite extreme measures taken elsewhere in Europe to limit the spread of the virus.

Six people have died in Britain from COVID-19, with more than 450 confirmed cases, but until now it has been business as usual for football despite the havoc inflicted on the global sporting calendar.

The Manchester City v Arsenal match, due to take place at the Etihad on Wednesday, was postponed as a “precautionary measure”, according to the Premier League. There are no plans to cancel other matches.

Several Arsenal players are in self-isolation after Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis contracted coronavirus but they are expected to return to training on Friday if they remain symptom-free.

Marinakis, who also owns Championship side Nottingham Forest, met several Arsenal players when the Gunners hosted the Greek side in a Europa League match last month.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative and Nottingham Forest have also returned no positive tests.

Arsenal’s opponents on Saturday, relegation-threatened Brighton, said that game was still scheduled to go ahead “following consultation with the Premier League and medical advisors”.

The postponement of the City game means Premier League leaders Liverpool can now no longer wrap up their first title in 30 years this weekend.

Klopp’s side would have been crowned champions for the first time since 1990 had City had lost to Arsenal and then also been beaten by Burnley on Saturday.

But if Pep Guardiola’s team lose, Liverpool could secure the title on Monday at the home of local rivals Everton.

- Europa League shutout -

This week’s Europa League away matches involving Manchester United, Rangers and Wolves will be played behind closed doors while Chelsea’s Champions League tie against in Bayern Munich on March 18 will also be played in an empty stadium.

The Europa League tie between Sevilla and Roma in Spain and Inter Milan’s game against Getafe in Italy have been postponed.

But Italian side Atalanta’s Champions League game at Valencia went ahead as planned on Tuesday even though Italy has more than 10,000 coronavirus cases -- the most outside China.

Wolves condemned the decision not to postpone their match away to Greek side Olympiakos on Thursday.

“Our position is that the trip poses unnecessary risks to our players, staff, supporters and the families of all who travel, at such critical and uncertain times,” a club statement said.

Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks following the decision by Italy’s government to suspend top-flight games until April 3.

Despite the growing crisis, Rangers boss Steven Gerrard said the Scottish Premiership should be played to a finish, even if it means staging games in empty stadiums.

“I think it would be a real big shame for everyone around Europe and the world if the league campaigns and cup competitions can’t finish, because people have earned the opportunity to get to the stage where everyone is at,” he said.

“So I don’t want to see anything finish right now. If we are told the only way to get stuff finished off (is to play behind closed doors) and we are told to do that we will follow.”

Klopp said Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus and Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea of matches being played in empty stadiums.

“The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together,” said the Liverpool boss, whose side need to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their last-16 tie.

“I’m not sure what is better in this case.”

Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, said: “We are here for the people.

“If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer. We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it.”"

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 22:55 IST

Argentina has suspended all sports events until the end of March as a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the sport secretariat said on Wednesday. The country’s football team was due to host Ecuador at the end of March in its opening qualifier for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The suspension covers “tournaments, competitions preparatory tours and/or sporting events to be held in the Argentine Republic,” a ministry statement said.

Argentina is one of a number of Latin American countries to have ordered the isolation of travelers from Italy and Spain amongst other countries.

A number of top Argentina stars play their club football in those two countries, such as Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and forwards Paulo Dybala of Juventus and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez.

Chile, Colombia and Peru, who are also due to host World Cup qualifiers later this month, have likewise announced isolation measures for people arriving from Italy, Spain and France.

Separately, organisers of the Argentine Moto GP due to take place in April announced it had been postponed until November.

Argentina has recorded 19 cases of the new coronavirus and is one of only two countries in Latin American to have had a patient die of the virus.

Latin America has been far less affected by the virus than other parts of the world but its recorded cases are now over 140 and rising rapidly."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 18:54 IST

World Championships bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) won a historic ninth Tokyo Olympic quota for India as he upset Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside of Australia 4-1 in the box-off bout at the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Wednesday.

This is India’s highest-ever haul of Olympic quotas, surpassing the eight they had earned at the 2012 London Games. The nine quotas also ensured that this was India’s highest ever qualification from a single qualifier.

The other 8 quotas have been brought home by Mary Kom (51kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Lovlina Borgohain (69kg). India has a chance to add further with the boxers, who failed in their quest at the Asian Qualifiers, getting one more opportunity to realize their Olympic dream at the World Qualifiers to be held in Paris in May.

India’s brilliant performance at the Asian Qualifiers also propelled them to the top position, where they are tied with Kazakhstan among 10 nations.

“It is a moment of pride for Indian Boxing. For the first time ever, 9 Indian pugilists have qualified for the Olympics and that too at the first qualifying event. We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories,” said Boxing Federation of India President, Ajay Singh.

“Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers possess. Having qualified in the first qualification event will give them a big boost and will motivate them to work harder. On our part, we along with the Sports Ministry and SAI will ensure that we provide them with the best possible infrastructure and support to meet the end objective,” he added.

Having lost in the quarter-finals, Kaushik was presented with one more chance of securing his maiden appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with the top six from 63kg eligible for Olympic quotas. This time he made no mistake.

In a brutal box-off bout that saw Garside fighting with a bloodied face, Kaushik endured some hard blows and a stiff challenge from his opponent to fulfil his Olympic dream. The 4-1 win also helped him avenge his 2018 Commonwealth Games final defeat to Garside.

Sachin Kumar (81kg), however, did not have the same fortune as he was blanked 0-5 by Tajikistan’s Shabbos Negmatulloev in the box-off final."

Updated: Mar 11, 2020 21:47 IST

The dress rehearsal of the lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame, which will be burning for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, was held on Wednesday at ancient Olympia in western Greece, the birthplace of the Games. The event took place without a hitch, according to an e-mailed press release by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) which organizes the ceremonies.

During a customary ritual originating in 1936, when the first such ceremony took place for the Berlin Olympics, Greek actress Xanthi Georgiou playing the role of an ancient high priestess lit the torch using a concave mirror and the sun’s rays.

In front of the ruins of the 2,500-year-old temple dedicated to Hera, the goddess of women, marriage and family in Greek mythology, a few meters from the entrance of the ancient stadium where the Games were born 25 centuries ago, she prayed to Apollo, the god of sun in Greek mythology, to light the torch.

Dozens of young female and male dancers playing the roles of priestesses, goddesses and male youths performed on the slopes inside the stadium a choreography inspired, as always, by images of ancient Greek pottery and sculpture.

A total of 55 people, all volunteers, took part in the ceremony, choreographer Artemis Ignatiou, artistic director of the ceremonies since 2008, told a press briefing recently.

The High Priestess then handed over to the first torchbearer the torch with the flame and an olive branch, a symbol of peace, honour and victory.

Anna Korakaki, the Greek Olympic shooting champion who had won a gold and a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics was chosen as the first torchbearer. She will be the first woman ever to start the torch relay on Thursday, when the official ceremony will take place.

Wednesday’s dress rehearsal was closed to the public due to prevention measures introduced because of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The Chairman of the HOC Torch Relay Commission Thanasis Vasileiadis, who is responsible for the ceremony, gave the final instructions so that everything runs smoothly on Thursday during the lighting ceremony, HOC said on Wednesday.

IOC President Thomas Bach, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and HOC President Spyros Capralos will attend the ceremony on Thursday which will also be closed to the public, according to the press statement.

A week later, on March 19, the hand over ceremony will be held in Athens’ Panathenaic Stadium, the marble venue of the first modern Olympics in 1896.

Katerina Sakellaropoulou, a former Greek top court judge and the first ever woman in the history of the Greek modern state who was elected President of the Hellenic Republic in January this year, will be present in her new role. She formally assumes office this Friday.

Another woman, Katerina Stefanidi, who had won a pole vault gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, will be the last Greek torchbearer to carry the Flame inside the Panathenaic Stadium, marking the end of the torch relay on Greek soil.

A total of 600 torchbearers will carry the Olympic Flame across 3,200 kilometres in Greece, passing through dozens of cities and archaeological sites, HOC officials said.

The second leg of the relay will end in July at the stadium, which will be the main venue of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games."

Even as Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty clarify that there is no misunderstanding between them, he has unfollowed her on Instagram, as per a Mumbai Mirror report. However, she continued to follow the filmmaker till Thursday morning. Katrina has worked with Rohit for the first time in Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi where she plays a doctor and is paired opposite Akshay.

After reports claimed Rohit had said no one would notice her, Katrina had clarified in an Instagram post, “Dear Friends and well-wishers... I normally do not comment on media reports or articles... But in this case, I feel a comment made by Rohit sir has been taken out of context and is being entirely misunderstood. I am referring to the comment as reported that Rohit Shetty said, ‘No one would look at me in the frame, as there are three boys there and a blast happening’, this is not what was said.”

She added, “I mentioned that I had blinked in the shot, and Rohit sir said, ‘there are four people together in the frame and a bomb blast happening, no one will notice you BLINKING.’ Even, in spite of that, we still did one more take. I share a very warm equation and friendship with Rohit sir and have always enjoyed our discussions on everything from cinema to my character and, more importantly, he has always been there as a friend for me. This has been taken entirely taken out of context. Hope you all have a great day.” However, ‘Shame on Rohit Shetty’ trended on Twitter soon after Rohit’s comments.

Talking about her role, Katrina had said at the trailer launch, “I absolutely love my part in the film. More than anything, what I look at when I see a film is whether the film works for me, has it moved me and is what I am doing crucial in the film. When you see the film, you will see that everyone’s role is crucial and the film has come out amazingly,” she had said.

Fans of Katrina outraged against Rohit when he reportedly said, “If you look closely, she is blinking (during it). After the fourth take, she came to me and asked: ‘Can we take one more?’ and I said, ‘Katrina, I will tell you honestly, no one is going to look at you.’ She got so wild. She said, ‘How can you tell me this?’ and I said: ‘Three guys are walking with blasts happening behind, nobody will notice you.’ And I kept that shot. In the promo, she blinks while walking. But kaun dekhega (who will notice)?”

Presented by Reliance Entertainment and produced by Rohit Shetty Picturez in association with Dharma Productions and Cape of Good Films, Sooryavanshi releases on March 24.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:18 IST

Mahhi Vij has given it back to trolls who were saying mean things about her newborn daughter, Tara. The actor’s husband Jay Bhanushali recently appeared on Colors’ reality show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and got into an argument with Paras Chhabrra, after which he was targeted by trolls.

When one involved Tara in the argument, Mahhi snapped and shared a strong-worded tweet. “Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo (face me if you have the guts or stop barking).shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls,” she wrote in her tweet.

Don’t get my daughter in between hai dum toh aao samne warna bhokna bandh karo.shame on u people shame on ur family for producing such bad souls — Mahhi vij (@VijMahhi) March 9, 2020

The Twitter user then deleted their account. Mahhi replied, “Agar dam hai toh keep ur Ac active (keep your account active if you have the guts) bcoz ull be behind bars for talking about rape lets see now dam hai rakh apna account active person cops trace u,” she wrote.

On the show, Paras had talked less than politely about the female contestants, saying that they were all fake and that merely looking at them gave him depression. Jay called his comment ‘wahiyat’ (disgusting) and Paras’ fans online didn’t take it well.

Mahhi and Jay welcomed Tara last year. He and his wife Mahhi Vij also have two other children, whom they had adopted earlier. Earlier this week, Mahhi talked about how she feels about unsolicited advice on parenthood.

Sharing a picture with Tara, she wrote, “People often tell me I am spoiling my girl let her cry. let her be independent 6 months baby. you are holding her too much. Next time you think about telling a mother what she should or shouldn’t when it comes to her kids, without her asking for your advice.Stop and keep it to urself. in the meantime I’ll continue to love al over my sweet doll while I can bcoz I know these moments won’t last forever.One day she won’t need me as much, or she s too cool for mumma m.. until thn I’ll soak in al of the cuddles.”

Jay, too, is excited about the new baby in his life. “Without the support of my family, I would have been nowhere. Especially my wife, the way she has transformed me from a boy to a man. I absolutely love spending time with my little ones. Whenever I’m not at work, I ensure that I spend most of my time with her. I take care of every little thing about her from feeding her to putting her to sleep and also part my role by helping Mahhi with whatever I can and it is the best feeling in the world,” he said.

Updated: Mar 12, 2020 12:10 IST

Saif Ali Khan’s son Ibrahim has completed his first professional photoshoot for a clothing brand and pictures from the shoot have surfaced online. In pictures where Ibrahim is seen posing for the cameras, he is seen wearing black coloured hoodie and also dons a white polo neck tshirt in one picture.

Fans were quick to appreciate his look, some even calling him a ‘replica’ of dad Saif. Ibrahim is often compared to Saif but his actor father has famously said that the younger Pataudi is “better looking” than him.

Ibrahim has often expressed interest in becoming an actor like his parents Saif and Amrita Singh, and sister Sara Ali Khan. Talking about Ibrahim and his career plans, Saif had earlier said, “He should, he’s looking good, better looking than I am! He’s a very charming guy. I definitely think all of my children would be interested in acting. We’re an acting family, the whole bunch of us are in the industry. So I’m sure. He’s still a little young, and I’m keener that he does university first. Then, of course, we’ll support him in whatever he wants to do.”

Ibrahim made his grand public debut in a recent magazine spread, alongside sister and Bollywood actor Sara Ali Khan. Ibrahim and Sara recently enjoyed holidays in Maldives. They also had a Goa vacation in February. Sara shared family pictures with brother Ibrahim and mother Amrita Singh. In one of the pictures, Sara is sitting on a bike/rickshaw, with Ibrahim as the passenger. The next picture shows a beaming Ibrahim standing in between his sister and mother.

Earlier this month, Ibrahim celebrated his birthday and sister Sara had posted a picture from their Maldives holiday to wish him as she could not be with him. Sara was shooting for Aanand L Rai’s Atrangi Re that also features Akshay Kumar and Dhanush. Talking about his acting dreams, Sara had earlier said, “I think Ibrahim definitely does want to be an actor. We talk about films and I do know that being an actor is what he dreams of. But I have also often told him that having a dream and living it are two different things. There is a lot of hard work because it’s not just glitz and glamour and I think he is aware of that.”

Actor Kareena Kapoor has been criticised online for perceived ‘arrogant’ behaviour with a fan on Holi. A video shared online shows Kareena apparently rebuffing a fan’s requests for a photograph.

The video shows Kareena exiting a building and being followed by a couple of fans. After one of them seems to invade Kareena’s personal space, the actor is seen saying something to her, but stops and poses for a picture with them anyway. Kareena then walks away.

The comments section of the post was flooded with angry reactions. “My goodness...Look at her attitude. Very bad... No doubt why bebo is regarded as one of the most arrogant actresses in Bollywood,” one person wrote. “She will learn biggest lesson of life once she reaches a stage where she would be deprived of this beauty and fame,” wrote another. Both comments received hundreds of ‘likes’.

Others pointed out how Kareena may be a star but has a right to have a normal day. “Don’t they have the right to lead a normal day with their kids.... some fans should really know to draw the line,” wrote one, while another schooled the fans, “If someone doesn’t want to click pics with you then don’t run after her as simple as that..true fans respect privacy! before judging any celeb learn to think from their perspective.”

Kareena celebrated the festival of colours with husband Saif Ali Khan and their son, Taimur. She also shared pictures on her newly minted Instagram account. Taking to the photo-sharing platform, Kareena posted a picture of herself and captioned it, “I think pink is my colour. Agree?” She also shared a picture of Taimur on Instagram stories, and captioned it, “Looks like pink is his colour too.”

The actor was last seen in the box office hit Good Newwz, with Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh, and she will next be seen in Angrezi Medium with Irrfan Khan, and is shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha, with Aamir Khan.

I have one of those videos, where my friend is telling me that I am constantly rubbing my head, and I turn around and tell her that I am actually dancing to ‘ Tattad Tattad ’.

Eminent Kathak exponent Sitara Devi is said to have met the rumoured couple ""huddled together"" in a Mumbai local first class, according to the book.Producer-director PN Arora, who directed Kaushal in his superhit film 'Pugree', vouched for the fact that Dilip Kumar frequently visited the actress on the set of the film. Arora also recalled how Kaushal's ""military man brother"" arrived at the set and brandished a pistol, ""threatening to kill Kamini"" is she did not call off her ""clandestine romance with Dilip Kumar"". According to the book, Kaushal's brother also threatened to kill Dilip Kumar.Around that time, the Urdu novelist Ismat Chugtai had also reportedly warned Dilip Kumar against the futility of the said romance.In fact, if the book is to be believed, Kaushal's brother reportedly shot himself, having failed to end the Dilip-Kamini romance. This has been seen as a major reason why the affair ended."

We ask him how often his mind went back to his personal memories as he filmed 'Angrezi Medium' – the story of a teenaged girl from Udaipur who has lost one parent and wants to go out and live her dreams, but money and other challenges put pressure on her and the family. “It was personal – but from an entirely different perspective”, he explains. “My child in 'Angrezi Medium' loses her mother when she is very young. I wasn’t... mine was a crisis of whether to pursue my dream or take care of my responsibility. For Champak (the character in 'Angrezi Medium') the dilemma is whether to let my daughter chase her dream or not... perhaps it would have been my father’s dilemma if he was alive. The crisis is of the father, not of the child, in this scenario. My mother was sure she wanted me not to chase my dream and stay with her, which, I recall, gave me lot of heartache. The culmination of Champak’s decision is perhaps what I would have wanted my mother to do... Let the child fly!”In 2017, Irrfan had made the point that “A film which does not have songs, which does not make too much of noise, people start calling it an art film; that is the tragedy of our times. This is a new kind of cinema which is emerging, and I think it has to pick up and it has to become bigger before Hollywood actually gulps you.” Would he place projects such as 'Hindi Medium' and 'Angrezi Medium' in that ‘new kind of cinema’? “Yes I would, and this new kind of cinema is evolving and earning money because people are getting the taste of characters and new stories... the actors are getting their due and sticking to their guns. A whole lot of new actors are now on the horizon who are not typical ‘hero’ or ‘heroines’. They are new characters. And this will grow. Hollywood still has power because of their finesse, but Indian content is definitely gaining momentum... it’s there to stay. Though the publicity is the same, just as the older content was publicised. The film is perhaps much fresher than the publicity!” he jests.Like in 'Hindi Medium', his character in 'Angrezi Medium' is not averse to bending rules, though in an endearing manner. Post 'Slumdog Millionaire', Danny Boyle had said that Irrfan had “an instinctive way of finding the moral centre of any character”. From the inspector in 'Slumdog' to the kidnapper in 'Madaari' to the father finding all sort of options to support his daughter in this project, how does he go about understanding what his characters do, even when – especially when – they aren’t always heroic? His nuanced response is what you would have expected. “It’s important to find the moral centre because otherwise one would never be able to relate. To play a character’s inside world it’s important to find his moral fabric. I can’t be judgemental while looking at a character. For the character to work for me, I have to find his emotional world. Even if I played Hitler, I would need to find out what he does, how he does it and when he does what.”“Stories are beyond judgment”, he adds. “They are there to leave you with an impression – sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes touched, to leave you misty-eyed with a smile, or angry. That’s where one explores. There should be always room for the audience to explore beyond judgement. For that I need to connect very strongly with the character.”In his note from London in 2018, Irrfan had said, “People have been wishing me well, praying for me, from all over the world. People I know, people I don’t even know.” Even though he isn’t stepping out to promote his film, his fans have been simultaneously “inside very emotional” about his personal battle, and “outside very happy” at his return to the big screen, just like his character in the trailer. How much do their vibes and messages drive him? “It is a reassurance”, is his simple response. “Their wishes are like guiding angels that keep replenishing me. I had thought out of sight might be out of mind.” That, of course, hasn’t been the case. He explains further that his engagement on social media began on PR advice but served to remind him that his fans hadn’t forgotten him in the least. “As my PR says, ‘sir, Insta mein daalte rahiye, Facebook etc also... bahut important hai...’ I was always kind of amused with social media. But when this (fans wishing and praying for him) happened, I was reassured that I wasn’t out of mind just because I was out of sight. I was always against publicity of a film. But I never knew it will manifest this time in this way!”We had gone across when Irrfan was shooting at Revla Khempur near Udaipur last year. The pain, the fatigue, the physical challenge was visible. Yet, at the same time, Homi and him were posting memes online and laughing incessantly on the set. We ask him, in what frame of mind has he shot this movie? How have the director, the crew, been with him – walking on glass or letting their hair down? “Unfortunately I was in pain sometimes even while shooting”, he recollects, “but Homi has an infectious energy and Dinoo a rare positivity and Anil Mehta (our cameraman) a rare sensitivity. The crew was warm and so, laughing away, we crossed the river.”Now that we’re talking about Homi, let’s remind Irrfan what Homi said about the actor: “He came in like an almost clean slate, wondering whether he’d forgotten acting. But there was never a false beat with him; Irrfan is incredibly organic.” Did he really wonder if he had ‘forgotten’? Did the personal battle make it tougher for him to act, or did it make him even sharper, living in the moment? “I forgot how to act and then I wanted to forget and come clean,” he answers. “My personal battle has made me more sensitive in a good and a bad way. I was a man of few words, and now they’ve become fewer,” responds Irrfan – in few words, of course.When we went across while Irrfan was shooting for 'Angrezi Medium' at Revla Khempur near Udaipur, the pain, the fatigue and the discomfort were visible on his face. Despite that, Homi and him were posting memes online and laughing continuously on the set"

To be a part of a story that somewhere gave me a character to even voice out a lot of my own thoughts about it, opinions, complications, confusions and all that about a subject as sensitive as this.""Without being preachy, still telling so much. That for me was really liberating and the story itself, the way Ruchi has written it, the entire narrative, it really holds. It's an immersive experience.""Kiara signed big films, including Dharma's 'Good Newwz' and 'Shershah', but she never felt that doing a movie for the web would be any less than a theatrical high.""I believe content comes in every form. If there is a film that I want to watch and I can see myself adding to it in some way, I want to be a part of it. I had to be a part of it... Today, you have to be relevant. This is the next big step. Lines are blurred today,"" she adds."

Richa Chadha: When I was younger, people would exploit me for my work and talent","Richa Chadha has been portraying polarized characters on the silver screen in her more than a decade long career. She has made her mark with performance like 'Gangs of Wasseypur', ‘ Masaan ’ and ‘Fukrey’ to name a few. With the world celebrating International Women ’s Day yesterday, Richa Chadha shares her thought on the same, exclusively with ETimes. Excerpts from the interview:Women's day is really a day that was meant to celebrate women and honor their accomplishments. it was meant to cause sensitivity about gender issues now as we see few marketing people taking advantage of it, asking women to work for free or post for free is quite funny but I still it has relevance because till the time India has equal society we will need something like women's day.The first one was my mother, because she really led an example. My mom is an extremely well educated who worked throughout her life and she raised us. I'm inspired by her because the number of things she did for the society. She is a teacher essentially and always taught underprivileged kids or blind students or students who don’t have access to tuitions. It was just out of love and service. The second person who impacted me is Jeromulla, my professor who was curator of the course I did at the Sophia college. At that time I was afraid of her and unhappy about being me to study etc. but the things that I've learned from her have opened my mind and heart to such a large extent that I'm always going to be grateful. When you're young, you're 19, you don't realize the impact of something and for that reason I'm very grateful to Jeromulla. I am very careful about who has impacted my life, so I am going to leave out the third woman as in when I can think of third woman I'll post or talk about it.Two pieces of advice to my younger self would be always be confident and never be so nice. When I was younger I would be taken for a ride alot, I would believe anybody at face value, I was quite a lallu actually everybody would fooled me, exploit me for my work and talent and I would cry about it later. Now I am smart and sure that there will be people who are smarter and more evil but that doesn't matter because I've learnt how to hold my own and I’ve got the exploiters descending into nothing. Second piece of advice I would like to give myself would be to continue working hard on the mind and on the body and keep reading books because that is a sure short way of getting success in life, that is a thing that distinguishes a normal average performance of somebody very smart, like their ability to read and be knowledgeable and be curious towards life.I message is, dear men, you cannot stop us from breaking the so called glass, please learn to treat us with equality in the house and outside in the workplace, please learn to treat us with equality in your mind and in your heart because there is no growth in the society no evaluation unless 50% of the population feels completely at home feels at ease and right now that is not happening because India is one of those countries where violence against the girl child starts in the womb.I am very lucky to find love from a man who respects me and my craft and my work honours me for the person that I am. But I don't think that anybody's personal growth can is incumbent pm them being in a hetro relationship of any kind. I think your first relationship that you need to master is with yourself, your body, your mind, with your heart when you understand what triggers you have, what makes you upset what causes you to sort of take chances. So I think that the first relationship and the only relationship that one should worry about in the true sense is the one with the self."

Scriptwriter Farhad Samji admits that initially the team was sceptical about a second coming of the comic caper fearing comparisons. “But even 'Judwaa' was a cult film, featuring Salman Khan in his first double role, and Varun pulled off ' Judwaa 2' with elan,” he points out, quick to add that while no one can recreate the chemistry of the original actors, the first time-pairing of Varun and Sara works for this film equally well.“While the germ of the idea remains the same, we have reworked the script to make it more contemporary. Nothing looks out-dated now,” Farhad assures. Prod him on the changes and the writer informs that much of the romantic track has been overhauled. “The concept of love-at-first sight is passé and couples no longer wander hand-in-hand in the park. We had to make the two characters compatible to each another with a sprinkle of a good love story.”The Vashu and Jackky Bhagnani production has recreated two chartbusters from the earlier film, 'Husn Hai Suhana' and 'Main Toh Raste Se Jaa Raha Tha' and some of the gags, with lot of new ones too. """"Like the 'Housefull' and 'Golmaal' franchises, the humour in 'Coolie No. 1', too, is situational and comes from the strong ensemble cast of Paresh Rawal, Johnny Lever and Jaaved Jaaferi , with Varun unabashedly playing to the gallery this time,” shares Farhad. Kader Khan who played the girl’s millionaire dad, Hoshiyaar Chand, in the 1995 film has since passed away. Paresh Rawal is the new entrant and Farhad is quick to say that while he’s playing the same role, the character has his own body language and mannerisms.Farhad made his debut as a lyricist in David’s 2002 multi-starrer, 'Hum Kisise Kum Nahin' after which he turned a writer and finally, a director with Akshay Kumar’s 'Entertainment'."

In 2017, he played his neighbour in Hindi Medium, and in 2020, he will be seen as his brother in Angrezi Medium . In between these, with films like Omkara (2006), 1971 (2007) and the Tanu Weds Manu series (2011 and 2015), he gained credibility as an artiste who can pull off any character with ease. Over to Deepak Dobriyal who talks about his journey so far, why he has never asked for a role and why he loves working with Irrfan . Excerpts:It is very important for me because yes, the films that I did after Hindi Medium had a relatively niche and smaller audience, which would draw footfalls only on the basis of word of mouth. I had not done a commercial mainstream film since then. Being a part of commercial set-ups is just as important for any actor. My role in Angrezi Medium is not just long in terms of screen time, but also crucial to the story. I was getting a chance to work with Irrfan bhai all over again. In the last decade, we could have worked on so many films together, but things didn’t work out. Hindi Medium ke baad, dobara unke saath kaam karne ka chance meri sabse badi lalach thi. Our tuning had worked out so well in Hindi Medium; I was getting a chance to enhance it further. We had a great time off camera, which is evident in the way we have enacted our scenes together. Our chemistry as brothers seems natural. Also, films like Angrezi Medium are important because while you work to enhance your career graph and impress your existing audience, you also have to find inroads into the hearts of the younger generation. I’ve done so many characters, but youngsters don’t remember what I did before Tanu Weds Manu Returns. You have to make yourself accessible to the young generation of audience with the kind of work that they can appreciate. If you think that unko cute ke chakkar mein kuch bhi thama denge toh chalega, you’re wrong. They’re intelligent and discerning.I was his henchman in Maqbool (2003), which was a small role. Irrfan bhai cared for me even back then. I remember, there was a patch when I fell ill. I reported to work despite having a fever and he figured that. He got me a three-day break and kept a tab on my health. A gesture like that can never be forgotten. I had promised myself that I will always be there for him, come what may. After that, we stayed in touch and met a few times as well. He loved my work and I loved all his films. I wanted to work with him again and when Hindi Medium came by, I grabbed it. It gave Irrfan bhai and me the chance to catch up on lost time and conversations. At that time, we used to shoot all day, go swimming at night and have meals together. On the shoot, he stopped people from interfering with the way I was trying to improvise my scenes. He supported me like a brother and he subtly showed that he trusts me. That helps enhance a scene so much more. Bhai khiladi aadmi hain. He can handle anything in a scene and make it look great. Iss baar, Angrezi Medium shoot karte waqt hum Thames ke kinaare baithte the London mein. We used to watch cricket together. All of us on the set made sure that we keep the atmosphere light and fun. When he would come on the set, we would first make him laugh and feel at ease, and then start work. Irrfan bhai’s enthusiasm kept the spirit of the team really high.I can’t believe it’s been that long! In these years, I never went around asking for work. I continue to audition for roles. The reason I never asked for work is that I always thought, ‘What if there is someone who can do the part better?’ By asking for that role, I am being unfair to that actor. And after asking for it, if I don’t do it well, it would be grave injustice to the role and to the person jiska mauka meri wajah se kho gaya. That’s the reason I don’t even approach my writer friends because I don’t want them to work with a bias. I’ve always worked with the mindset that if I deserve something, it will come to me on merit. That has earned me respect. Mohtaaji ka to angle hi nahi rakha maine. That’s why it took me a long time to get this far. I’ve always worked with the intention of being able to do something different and doing it really well. I don’t just want to be seen in a film. When you work with that in mind, it shows. In my downtime, I introspect and go back to Omkara. I always try to remind myself what it was about that role that worked for me. Also, I’ve learnt that to be able to play different roles and break out of your comfort zone, you have to keep learning new things. A footballer and a chess player have their energies in different places. You have to know kiski energy ko kahan channelise karna hai. Acting is like yog sadhana, you have to surrender to it, for it to work for you.Everyone is an actor in front of the camera, koi category nahi hoti hai. Accha idea, aur acchi performance koi bhi kar sakta hai. Character actors are called so because their dedication to a role is way higher. The first condition for anyone to be an actor is that they have to become a character. I find the term supporting actor or character actor derogatory. Sapne har actor ke bade hi hote hain, par haqeeqat har kisiki alag hoti hai. You could be a great actor, but you probably don’t fit into every mould. No one invests money in an actor who will not be able to draw an audience to the theatre on his own, right? I didn’t have that guarantee in those early days, but I had the promise of a good performance. Even when I had a small role, I did it like it was the central character. It takes years to find your ground in this business. Once you find it, you will fly."

As the name suggests, Badhaai Do is a family comedy that revolves around an unlikely relationship and promises double the fun and emotions. While the story and characters of Badhaai Do are different from that of Badhaai Ho, there is an endearing common theme between both the films. Helmed by prolific ad filmmaker and director of Hunterrr (2015), Harshavardhan Kulkarni , the film will bring on the screen the fresh pairing of National Award-winning actor Rajkummar Rao and powerhouse performer Bhumi Pednekar . Rajkummar plays the role of a Delhi cop, who is the only male police officer in a mahila thana, while Bhumi plays the role of a school PT teacher, much to her family’s stress. Unlike each other, yet made for each other, the film is the about the goof-ups that follow when they meet and their lives intertwine in more than one way.Director Harshavardhan Kulkarni says, “I have always admired the kind of films that Junglee Pictures has made, so when they came to me with this social comedy, I was instantly on board. Just like the delightful Badhaai Ho, the milieu of this film remains the same, but with a fresh set of characters and a completely new, zanier situation.”Akshat Ghildial, who wrote Badhaai Ho and won awards for its crackling dialogues, is penning this one too, along with Suman Adhikary whom the idea originally came from. Akshat said, “Suman came up with this interesting idea, and since I have a great relationship with Junglee, I shared it with them. They liked it immediately. And then, Harsh came on board. We had great fun developing it and hope that the audience has an equally good time watching it.”Talking about her role, Bhumi says, “Badhaai Ho is one of my favourite films in recent times, and it is really exciting to take this franchise forward. For me, the script is one of the best that I have ever come across, and I immediately wanted to do this film. My character again is strong, independent and author-backed, and it gives me a lot of scope to bring a very different and cool character to life. This time, too, the film will say something extremely relevant and relatable, but in a hilarious manner. I’m also excited to share screen space with Raj for the first time” Rajkummar adds, “I have played a cop before, but never with this perspective. I look for layered characters and this is a perfect match. My character is surrounded by strong women at home and work, and that adds immense depth to his personality. Junglee Pictures’ Bareilly Ki Barfi was a fabulous experience for me. Badhaai Do is a reunion in many ways.”Amrita Pandey, CEO, Junglee Pictures, said, “Junglee Pictures believes in telling rooted Indian stories that not only entertain you, but also move you in many ways. Badhaai Ho was just that for us. And that being a high-concept comedy, it was logical for us to expand the canvas to tell more such stories. Cultivating the right synergy on films like these is the key, and with Akshat and Suman’s writing and Harsh’s vision, Badhaai Do is really one of the best stories for us to tell.” The film is all set to go on floors in June and to release by early next year."

Amyra Dastur on International Women’s Day 2020: It’s a sad excuse to celebrate women,"Pretty lady Amyra Dastur was seen in interesting roles last year in movies like Kangana Ranut and Rajkummar Rao’s Judgemental Hai Kya, Sanjay Dutt-starrer Prassthanam and even Made in China which again featured Rajkummar Rao and Mouni Roy in lead roles. However, these are just some of the many films that the beautiful actress has featured in. However, she seems to be up for exploring new platforms now. Recent reports are that Amyra will be seen in a few web series soon. When she was asked at an interview about her shift from features films to the digital platform, she simply said that she was not leaving feature films altogether but just exploring the digital world as it had a wider reach. Meanwhile, ETimes managed to get hold of the busy actress for some time to known her thoughts on International Women’s Day which we are celebrating today. Here’s what she believes:Women’s Day started out on a good note, but now it’s more than a fad, it’s a con. It’s become a day for businesses and for brands to say that, oh, we have a special offer or special discount. Like, if you buy something today we’ll donate one sanitary napkin to one woman today. For me, it’s absolute nonsense because women are supposed to be treated with respect, care and love every single day of the year. Not just on the 8th of March. Special offers shouldn’t come just because it’s one day to celebrate women. They should come every day. If you want to be a charitable organization, then you should donate sanitary pads every single day, not just on one day to increase sales of your brand. Women’s Day is a sad excuse to celebrate women.At the end of the day, crime in our country hasn’t decreased; women still don’t feel safe here. I’m talking about Mumbai now too, not just Delhi or North Indian cities, which are prone to criminal activities. It’s all over India, there’s a fear of safety within all of us. Glorifying one day of the year for women isn’t going to change that. Women need to take a hard look at what is being offered to them on this day and what we actually need throughout the year to run our lives and empower each other and ourselves. Women’s Day is nothing less than an absolute joke at this point.The first is my mother, she definitely taught me selflessness. She left her job in marketing to raise both my brother and me, because we couldn’t afford help at the time. I grew up wanting a lot, because my parents couldn’t afford half the things I wanted. I clearly have very luxurious tastes, but she really taught me how to love myself and how to be happy with the things I have and how to have faith that things are going to get better. I’m going to make it, get it myself. The one thing she instilled in me was to never depend upon a man. She’s always taught me to be financially independent, she always said I don’t want you married before you’re 30. I want you to have a long career and earn yourself, become the person who can actually support herself. The biggest female influence in my life has been my mother and I couldn’t thank her enough.The second woman, I don’t want to mention her name, but she’s a very big marketing publicist in Bollywood and I remember when my first film was coming out, I was in a very toxic relationship at the time. I was only 20 and I was in love with this guy and he was treating me very badly. This lady pulled me aside, sat me down and had a very frank conversation with me, which she didn’t have to. She openly said, ‘You’re going to be very big one day; you’re going to have a good, long career. You’re a very mature levelheaded girl, even at your age. Do not let someone else drag you down, do not get mixed up in someone else’s toxicity, just because they don’t know how to take care of themselves. You’re not his mother, you want to be someone’s girlfriend then become their girlfriend, do not mother someone who is visibly treating you awfully.’ That meant a lot because at the time, I didn’t really have another strong woman helping me out, and nobody is going to advise you randomly. I actually took her advice and I’ve never been more thankful.Even a female stranger has impacted my life, more than a lot of people close to me have. I can’t really nail down another woman who’s impacted my life, more than my group of girls from The Trip, Shweta, Mallika and Sapna have taught me what true girlfriends are. I was actually really close to another group of girls before this and they actually treated me very badly. I worked with a couple of them, I took them in, one was doing my makeup, the other one styled me and they really put me down in ways friends shouldn’t. This group of girls, Mallika, Shweta and Sappers, they lifted me up more than a lot of my longest friends ever have. They get so happy every time I say I have a new project or brand and they showed me what true friends are. Those girls are my heart at this point and I don’t know what I’d do without them.The biggest one would be, do not take everything to heart. There are people out there whose goal in life will be to put you down and make you feel bad, like you’re lesser than them. At the end of the day, you have to be strong enough to smile in their face and say F-U with your eyes, but with that smile carry on with life and don’t react. Back when I was young, I would get affected easily by what people did or said.The second piece of advice would definitely be my choice of relationships. I would say, go with your gut, listen to your women’s intuition, because if you don’t it leads to some very hilarious but still heartbreaking stories. There’s a reason they call it women’s intuition, I always had that ‘oh, maybe I shouldn’t’ and if I had listened to that, it would have saved me from a lot of regret and heartbreak.We do not need one day of the year to celebrate women; every single day should be Women’s Day. You should never be afraid to speak up, just because you’re a woman. You should never, ever be put in a situation where you feel like somebody is putting you down or harassing you in anyway. According to me, women are stronger than men and I don’t mean that physically, but emotionally. We’re smart and I’ve seen the way a woman works, compared to the way a man works and I’ve seen how hard working a woman can be. At the end of the day, isn’t that what truly matters? To all the amazing women out there, just have faith and believe in yourself, because the strength a woman has overpowers any other kind of strength in the world.If I woke up as a man one day, this sounds really funny but I would try to go to the bathroom and see why men claim to have such a problem aiming. I think every girl’s dream is to be able to pee while standing, because if you see the state of some of the toilets in India, you definitely wouldn’t want to sit on any. That would be very fascinating for me. Being a man, for me wouldn’t be as much fun.As women, we get to do so much. We get to dress up, we get to do and wear so many things. Being a man is boring, but I think I’d definitely take out a bike and go biking all over Mumbai. Also, being a guy is a little easier as nobody really messes with a guy. I hope I don’t have to be a man for more than a day, though."

It’s a really cool song.”.Grateful, the film’s director, Homi Adajania says, “The Angrezi Medium journey has been unlike anything I’ve experienced. It’s been made with so much love and positivity and this video takes the spirit ahead…It’s a glimpse of what love and positivity looks like… These are beautiful people who gave us time with little notice, selflessly pitched in and I love them for this.”Angrezi Medium has been scored by musician duo Sachin-Jigar and this special song, Kudi Nu Nachne De which is sung by Vishal Dadlani speaks for equality and respecting a person’s wishes. Katrina Kaif adds, “Irrfan and Homi are two of my most favourite people, so when he called me there was no question of me not stepping in. I feel that when we can be there for someone, we should. That’s how it should be in our industry.” About the song Anushka Sharma says, “When Homi sent me the song, it was on loop and it still is. This song is going to make everyone super happy.”An emotional Janhvi Kapoor adds, “Irrfan sir has given all of us so much and we want to see him back soon and in the best health possible.” In the film, Irrfan plays a single father who is willing to go to bizarre lengths to make his daughter’s dream come true. Celebrating the song, Ananya Panday says, “This is going to be an anthem for all the girls. It’s definitely my anthem already."" Echoing this sentiment, Kiara Advani adds, ”It’s every single girl’s inner voice that says – Let us just be, let us just have fun.”Playing Irrfan’s daughter in the film, Radhika Madan is thrilled to be a part of the ’kudi tribe’ saying, ”Don’t clip a girl’s wings and she’ll make the world a magical place.” Producer Dinesh Vijan signs off, “It’s not just the industry, gestures like this make the world a better place… I hope it encourages more of us to support and be there for each other.”"

International Women’s Day 2020: My father never differentiated between my brother and I says Pooja Hegde,"The beautiful Pooja Hegde has ruled hearts ever since she made her Bollywood debut with the Hrithik Roshan-starrer Mohenjo Daro . Most recently, she was seen paired with Akshay Kumar in the 2019 film Housefull 4 where she looked perfect on screen with the Sorryavanshi actor. However, these are not the only films she is known for. Pooja has done many big films in the South film industry as well and will be soon featuring in Salman Khan ’s Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali too. The Bollywood film is scheduled for an Eid 2021 release and while we wait for that, ETimes exclusively interacted with Pooja on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2020. Here’s what the stunning woman has to say about the day:I think Women’s Day is just a reminder for men out there to celebrate the women in their lives and a reminder for women to celebrate themselves. As women, we are constantly thinking about others. This day gives them a reminder to spoil and pamper themselves because self love is something that is very important.As clichéd as it sounds, my mother. My mother never really gave us motivational speeches. But she taught us a lot through example. The way she has led her life, in such a strong, independent and loving way is something I have found very inspiring. She ran her own computer business and at the same time raised two children and took care of the house in such an easy and efficient way. She’s a superhero in my eyes.I would advice men to empower women around them more. My father never differentiated between my brother and I and always motivated me to be the best I can be in whatever I did. As a result of which, I grew up very independent and strong.Well hopefully, I wouldn’t do anything different to what I’m doing right now. We are all actively trying to achieve equality between men and women, and as a feminist I strongly believe we can get there. We are all humans at the end of the day, and if we can celebrate equal rights, and moreover the right to be human, it shouldn’t matter whether one is male or female.I hope that the government takes the day as an inspiration to get together and come up with stricter policies for rape. A no-nonsense attitude towards rape is something that is needed to make India safer for women."

Meanwhile, with the world celebrating the International Women’s Day 2020, we caught up with Saiee for a chat and she exclusively shared her thoughts about the day with ETimes.I wouldn’t say it’s a “fad” but I don’t think one day is enough to celebrate all that women are. They should be celebrated everyday! Having said that, a day like this is very unifying. Yes, it is a day to celebrate the unity the world shows in appreciating women.First, I’d have to say my mom - she’s been my backbone and she has only more and more love to give everybody, everyday. No matter what her day has been like, she makes sure everything is right with ours, which is so selfless. She is so compassionate and loves unconditionally. She inspires me to be a better person.Second, Juuhi Babbar Soni! Whatever I am on screen is all thanks to her. She opened me up as a person, helped me get rid of my inhibitions and brought out the best in me. She’s been my guiding force and I am so thankful to have her in my life.Third, my sisters, Gauri and Ashu! Without them, my life wouldn’t be the same. They’re with me through thick and thin, they’re my best friends.First would be to be comfortable with who you are, always. Don’t regard the mean comments people make or feel the pressure to fit in. Embrace your differences. And second would be to have courage, and not be afraid to go after what you want with everything you’ve got.Respect women and most of all, love them. That is what they need.Depends on how healthy the relationship is. If it’s a loving, understanding relationship, it’s an important part of a woman’s well being. If it’s toxic, it isn’t."

The idea of being an Indian and not about being a Parsi or a Hindu or or a Muslim, we haven't looked at it on the basis of the religion,"" Akshay told in an interview here.When asked if the film is more relevant in current times of communal unrest in the country, the actor said, ""It is a coincidence, we haven't made it deliberately (now).

International Women's Day 2020: I call my mom to sing a special song for her on this day says Iulia Vantur,"Romanian model Iulia Vantur has become a familiar name in Bollywood. She was last seen in the music video 'Harjai' with popular anchor Maniesh Paul . Iulia and Maniesh had also crooned the song composed by Sachin Gupta . The singer-cum-actor will be soon making her Bollywood debut with Prem Raj Soni 's upcoming film ' Laila Majnu '. On the occasion of International Women's Day Iulia got in a candid interaction with ETimes, where she shared why International Women's Day is special to her, women who are her biggest inspiration and how important is a 'relationship' for a woman for her well-being.1. Is Women’s Day really a day to celebrate or it has become just a fad?I’ve celebrated Woman’s Day ever since I was a kid. Back in Romania, we love this special day, where we celebrate women, especially our mothers. They deserve the most to be worshipped, as goddesses. They gave us the most precious gift- a life. If I’m not in Romania, I still call my mom to sing a special song for her, that I have sung for her since I was a child and I send her flowers. She gets very emotional. She is one of the kindest human beings I know.In Romania, this holiday is very important. I hope it is the case in India as well because celebrating women is actually celebrating life.2. Name three women who have changed your life and how?a) My mom- she has offered me life, love, care and a good education. For every child, their mother is their “Guru”b) My acting teacher, during my Law University Mihaela Arsenescu Werner. She is a wonderful, kind woman who saw my potential and encouraged me to audition at a TV casting.c) The producer of “Dancing With The Stars”: Mona Segall . She taught me television; she knew how to enhance my qualities, my sensibility, empathy and my love for people. She did all this through that wonderful show, which has changed so many lives and has done so much for charity.My whole career I’ve worked the most with women. I’ve been blessed to work with a lot of strong, smart and powerful women, whom I’ve learned a lot from.3. If you had to give two pieces of advice to your younger self what would it be?Never be afraid to show yourself the way you are. You are unique; there isn’t another person in the world like you. Make the world more beautiful by adding your uniqueness to it. The world is like a puzzle and your piece is needed to complete the final picture.4. If you could send one message to men on Women's Day, what would it be?Women are mothers. All men out there, should think of the love and respect they have for their mothers and celebrate all women like that.5. How important is a relationship in overall well being of a woman?A woman is mirroring herself in her partner. It’s the same for both partners, be it men or women. We grow; we learn from our relationships, it’s the most intimate way of growing. Our environment matters, whether it’s harsh or loving, it makes us learn and grow. We need each other for life. A woman and man are like Ying & Yang, they need to be together for the continuation of life."

Kirti Kulhari on women she looks up to: I have known Vidya Balan personally and she really inspires me!,"She might not be quite enthusiastic when it comes to celebrating ‘special days’ but she sure does understand and respects the spirit behind those days. Kirti Kulhari , in an exclusive chat with ETimes on International Women’s Day, opened about women who have inspired her, advice she would love to give men on this special day and more. Excerpts from the interviewis as much of a fad than any other day that gets celebrated. I think more than anything else it is a reminder for everyone about what that day means. While I am not a big fan of celebrating any kind of a day, I understand the spirit behind it. Sometimes it does become more of a fad and loses its original spirit. However, if people remember the meaning behind it, I think we are good.While nobody has changed my life as such, there are people who I look up to. The names I would love to include in that list is my mother. I have grown up not knowing my own mother very well. I was closer to my dad. But now, over the years, I have become closer to her and I know her so much more now. I also looked up to my sister so much as she was very different than me. She had these amazing qualities and calmness. She is a beautiful person. Just her presence and being who she is has taught me so much.Amongst the actors, Vidya Balan is somebody I happen to know personally. She really inspires me. Meryl Streep also inspires me a lot. I have never really met her. Being who she is has really inspired me.I would tell my younger self that you are perfect with all your flaws and imperfections. I will tell myself it is okay to make mistakes, to fall and to be not okay. I would surely love and accept myself much more.I would like to tell all the men that we women love you. Our lives are incomplete without you. We need you as much as you need us. We are not competing with you; we are with you. We are here to support you and that is what we are asking for in return.Relationships are important for everybody. They are not any less important for men. When you have a healthy relationship and you experience love, peace and happiness in your relationship, it just has a very positive effect on your overall well-being.I think this question is here because we all believe that women are more emotional. They get carried away and feel more. The feminine part of anybody is that which is emotional and nurtures. Relationships make a lot of difference to a woman to how she feels, how she loves herself and others to how well she does in her career."

If you are able to impact your fellow men, just to make them understand women a little more, I would probably do that. I would take it very responsibly and give it back, no fun.” Nushrat also spoke about the women who changed her life and an advice she would want to give her younger self.

However, with time, society changed and so did the place of women in it. As cinema is known to mostly reflect the trends in the society, Hindi cinema became Bollywood and women started being given equal screen space and opportunities as the men in the industry. And we must say that they made good use of this to prove to the world that if given a chance, women are the most hardworking humans and can pull off anything just like their fellow actors on screen. So, we take a look at the five times when top actresses of Bollywood like Katrina Kaif Priyanka Chopra and others pulled off acts that men are generally known to do.Katrina Kaif is one such hardworking actress in B Town who can literally go to any lengths to get her act right. From training long hours at a dance hall to perfect her dance moves to taking Hindi lessons for getting a command over the language, the talented actress has come a long way. And so, it was not a surprise when Katrina decided to train hard in hand-to-hand combat, kick-boxing and learning how to handle a gun for the 2017 Salman Khan-starrer ‘Tiger Zinda Hai’. The woman was out there on the screen, punching men in the face and kicking them in the gut like a pro. And the way she held the different guns in the Ali Abbas Zafar directorial was worth a watch. She just showed all the men in Bollywood that she was no less than them and could pull of any act without a body double.Before Katrina, Priyanka Chopra too had proved her prowess in acting and hard work in the 2014 biopic Mary Kom. Based on the life of the fly weight boxing champion who won bronze for India at the London Olympics in 2012, this Omung Kumar directorial saw Priyanka work harder than ever before. The former Miss World was seen training really hard in boxing as well as doing endurance training just like any man would do. There were no short cuts or easy ways for her just because she was a woman or an actress. She did everything, exactly the way Mary Kom had done in real life and it all translated on to the big screen. Priyanka’s Mary was as real as it could get and we all were proud to have such a brilliant and dedicated actor as part of Indian cinema.And even before Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif, super duper talented actress Tabu showed men how it’s done when it comes to playing a cop as she played Inspector General Meera Deshmukh in the 2015 Ajay Devgn-starrer Drishyam. This Nishikant Kamat directorial was a remake of the 2013 Malayalam film by the same name. But we must say that Tabu carried the remake on her able shoulders just as much as Ajay did with his Vijay Salgaonkar. However, this was not the first time that the actress was playing a cop. Much much before these new-age films too, the dashing Tabu has played a Police Inspector in the 1999 film Kohram, and a CBI Officer in the 2010 release Khuda Kasam.When Aamir Khan and directed Nitesh Tiwari cast Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra for the 2016 sports drama ‘Dangal’, they were unsure how the girls would cope with the extreme training for the characters of Geeta and Babita respectively. While the initial days of wrestling proved to be the toughest ones Fatima and Sanya had ever experienced, soon they mastered the sport with magical speed. And all this was thanks to nothing but their immense dedication towards giving the best performance on screen and their determination to overcome their drawbacks. Fatima and Sanya proved to the world that nothing was impossible for women. While the movie was inspired by the real lives of wrestling champions Geeta and Babita Phogat, these two actresses too showed everyone how even they could push their physical boundaries to achieve at least a sliver of what the original champions had achieved in the akhada.While gang fights are not exactly a thing that anyone should indulge in, when done for the right reason, they are still worth the risk. Men are known to get egoistic and get into group fights to prove their so-called male power. But when it comes to women, they generally shy away from such situations. However, in a particular part of the 2007 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer ‘Chak De! India’, when a group of men are seen eve-teasing a woman from the girl’s hockey team that is at a coffee shop, the women surprise viewers by attacking the men with the most ferocious force. Just like a gang war between two groups of men, here, the women’s group is seen giving it back to the men with equal power to protect another woman’s dignity. The sports drama was directed by Shimit Amin and starred 16 actresses including Vidya Malvade, Sagarika Ghatge, Shilpa Shukla and Chitrashi Rawat in pivotal roles among others apart from King Khan."

It not only talks about domestic violence but also the gender roles and stereotypes we have normalised in our society. The film, which stars Taapsee Pannu in the lead, questions the societal conditioning that makes people blind to the unfairness behind the ‘ sirf ek thappad’. So men, on Women’s Day today, why not move beyond the cliched long social media posts and pictures with the women in your lives, and actually thank them by watching a film that will make you value them more? “On Women’s Day, everyone should do one thing they feel will take us towards gender equality – and getting rid of stereotypes and conditioning will surely be a step in that direction. It will be great if this Women’s Day, men take the women in their lives along to watch the film. It will help them see their relationship in a newer, better light and reduce the gender gap,” says Taapsee. Anubhav adds, “We need to realise how our minds are conditioned to not know what went behind our packed lunch boxes, besides the obvious, of course. We were not conditioned to feel thankful about those million small things everyday. A movie can’t wake us up to all those, but 'Thappad' gently nudged people in that direction.” Appreciating the effort of the entire cast and crew of the movie, producer Bhushan Kumar says, “'Thappad' is a very important film in today’s time. Anubhav showed our audience a reflection of the society we live in and started a conversation that can bring about change. We need the support of our audiences in helping this film’s message reach everywhere, leading to a reform in our society.”"

From ' Dhaakad ' to 'Badal Pe Paon Hain', these songs have become ‘women anthems’. On International Women’s Day, the creators of these tracks tell us that they aren’t surprised by the fact that these songs emerged as “forever favourites” of people across age groups, irrespective of their gender. One reason for their popularity, they say, is that these tracks aren’t preachy – instead, they are cool, peppy and relatable.'Highway’s' Patakha Guddi remains a favourite with the young audience. Sung by Nooran Sisters, the song is a hit even at fashion events and is one of the most played songs at Sufi nights across restaurants. In an interview, the two sisters said that out of all the songs they have sung, Patakha Guddi will always be their favourite.Raftaar says that out of all the songs that he has sung, Dhaakad is the one he is most proud to be associated with. He says that it is the kind of song he always wanted to do. What makes Dhaakad special is that it doesn’t try to give a message and simply talks about “every woman who is an achiever in her own way.” Raftaar tells us, “We always hear about what one should or shouldn’t do, but I’ve never followed any rulebook. The best part about Dhaakad is that it doesn’t preach, and it boosts the morale of anyone who hears it. The song is about women who don’t have to prove to anyone that they are equal. It feels good to see that Dhaakad became the song that makes every woman proud.”A film that gave a new definition to women empowerment, 'Chak De! India' had not just one, but two amazing songs – Badal Pe Paon Hain and Ek Hockey Doongi Rakh Ke. Salim-Sulaiman, who composed the songs, say that it was challenging to compose tracks for women who were not stars or popular faces, but strong characters who represented girls from every walk of life. “The filmmaker wanted a rock and roll song and we didn’t have any reference to create it. We wanted the music to reflect the spirit of these young girls who were working hard to realise their dreams. I think what made Badal Pe Paon popular was that it had hope, it signifies the journey of these girls – they come from small towns and villages and get a chance to fly for the first time. The song had a message that resonated with every girl,” says Salim, adding that his other all-time favourite ‘women anthem’ is Salaam India from Mary Kom. “It is my favourite because I find it very inspiring,” he adds.‘ Muh tod de’, ‘ halkat’, ‘ muhfat’ – it was the lyrics of Aali Re that impressed Sonu Kakkar when she was offered the song. “What makes this song popular is its spirit and energy. When Amit Trivedi approached me with this song, I was impressed with its peppy lyrics, as it says a lot about the women of today. It has an attitude. I was told that since this song is about strong, modern women, sing it with full josh. That’s what made Aali Re special. I was repeatedly reminded k i khul ke gaao. The song resonates with women of all age groups because it has a cool vibe. I think it was one of my best works because I enjoyed singing it,” she shares."

He is one of the most hardworking and sincere actors I have worked with,"" Sunit told media agency.""Shraddha has been a childhood friend. As kids, we always discussed films and to work together was something very special.

I had already done my acting training from Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York and New York Film Academy before becoming an assistant director.""I first wanted to know the technical aspects of film making on how the actors perform in front of the camera and how the directors take out the performance from them.

That's your problem. Disrespect is different. You must stand up and defend (against) that. What purpose does ego serve? I'm just a person,"" Katrina said.""Whether it is Shah Rukh or Hrithik, Akshay or Salman, I'm very fortunate to call them friends and they are important to me. I can talk to them any time.

I wanted to be loved by people and seen by people. That came from when I was growing up. I have zero inhibitions about hiding and changing that. That's my journey and my story, and I have to own that. I did exactly what I set out to do. Every day I realize how fortunate I am to say that. I wanted to be known in every household, my idol was Hema Malini ji and that's what I was interested in being.""For Katrina, life is all about striking a balance. ""There's a lot that you need to try and balance. A lot changes, so it's very hard to talk about your career. It becomes a subconscious engrained habit to whether I'm doing well. It's judged by the parameters of the film industry and media. Your sense of self and your sense of self worth gets driven by that. Your sense of self comes from who you are. Whether a film is a success or not has to not weigh on your sense of self.""Talking about finding herself, the Britain-origin actress said: ""I'm a huge believer of self-therapy and think everyone should do it. Try to get a hold and understand who you are. You will be crushed, your soul will be crushed if your sense of self is decided by the box office and your popularity. You have to decide where you stand, for you to be happy and satisfied and growing. You have to try and place yourself where you want to be. If you're trying to chase a number, that won't happen. You won't get the kinds of projects you are looking for.""Katrina asserts that she found her ""identity of who I was in India"".""I took after my father in the sense that I had a connecting to this country. I felt like everyone was amazing and kind and loving and welcoming to me. There was no fear anywhere when I came here. I heard lots of things about the industry but I didn't feel it.

""Bollywood is a very different industry, especially in music. In playback singing, it all depends on the subject of the film a certain kind of voice (is required). In South I have collaborated more and I am also doing collaborative work in the independent music scene. I love writing my own song. I write songs in the English language, so I am doing music mostly in the UK.""""From the beginning of my career, I never thought that unless I make my mark in Bollywood, it is nothing. As a singer whether I am singing in a South Indian film or in a Hindi film, I feel equally happy because I am singing!"" Shruti signed off."

We would have collaborated before. In fact, we had tried twice, but things didn’t work out. Better late than never, no?For me, doing stunts is like going to Disneyland; I love it. And it’s all real action. It’s not the VFX guy in front of the computer making the actor a hero, but the actor, who is working towards becoming one. I can do action for another four-five years. Then, my age will tell me to back off.It’s difficult to pinpoint a particular stunt as I have done so much of action. Action is tricky; actors who have pulled off bigger stunts broke their knees or ankles jumping from a stool.I lost eight-nine kg, as I needed to look like an ATS (Anti Terror Squad) officer.It’s unusual as three actors don’t come under one roof on everyday basis. 'Singham' was the first film. Then Rohit introduced 'Sooryavanshi' in 'Simmba'. Now, they come together with me towards the end of my film. Hats off to Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh for agreeing to play small parts in this film.It is India’s 'Avengers' and is very successful. I feel a lot of pressure to ensure that 'Sooryavanshi' does not break the chain towards building a successful cop universe. If this one doesn’t run, the chain will be broken.The traits of all three characters and their way of looking at things is different. The only thing they have in common is the uniform.It was an iconic song. There is a lot of pressure to recreate it and get the same sort of response. Katrina and I are working together a decade after 'Tees Maar Khan'. I wonder why it took so long…(Winks) We have discussed comedies in the past. Anything can happen. About crossover, imagine ' Hera Pheri ' meeting 'Golmaal' .Wouldn’t it be amazing to see characters from both films together?It all depends on my producer, Firoz Nadiadwala. Talks have been on since the last 14 years.(Cuts in) No, no, I started shooting for 'Saugandh' in 1990, so this is the 30th year. Time just flew by, from 20 to 50. It feels like just yesterday that I shot for 'Waada Raha Sanam' ('Khiladi') and 'Mang Meri Bharo' ('Sabse Bada Khiladi').I had 103 temperature when I landed in Coimbatore, driving down to Ooty, to shoot for 'Saugandh'. I had to perform a handstand, kick the villain and get kissed on the forehead by Rakhee ji who was playing my mother. My make-up man gave me some Ayurvedic medicine for the fever and I was fine. He is still working with me.Unlike 12 years ago, the audience today is ready to see a film on sanitary pads ('Padman'), toilets ('Toilet: Ek Prem Katha'), IVF ('Good Newwz') and sperm donation ('Vicky Donor'). So many issues can be touched on, so many historic events be recreated. I want to do it all. It’s a good time to be an actor.The only detox from work is more work. That’s what rejuvenates me. I like travelling—to Maldives, South Africa, even a drive to Lonavala.'Bachchan Pandey' is still being scripted. 'Atrangi Re' is a lovely film written by Himanshu Sharma; I’m looking forward to working with ' Aanand L Rai '. In 'Laxmmi Bomb', I play a transgender. Nobody has ever touched this topic. If I speak more about these films, the producers will take away my contract.It is all hype, nothing more. I was shooting at Mehboob Studio and Salman was there too. We sat and chatted for a long time, but didn’t even discuss the clash. It is a festive period. Two films can easily be divided between 6000 screens. There have been clashes in the past; I don’t see a problem here."

This week was as happening as the last week with quite interesting things happening in Bollywood. While Kareena Kapoor Khan made her Instagram debut, Akshay Kumar punished Ranveer Singh for arriving late for the trailer launch of ‘Sooryavanshi’. But that’s not it. Here are other posts that drove social media equally crazy. Have a look:While all the top actors have been mastering the art of using the photosharing app Instagram, there are still some celebs who have chosen to stay away from the temptations of the millenials. And the top names among them are those of the Kapoor cousins. Both Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ranbir Kapoor have been mysteriously missing from social media and yet have been pronounced as the official gossip mongers of Bollywood by none other than Karan Johar. The filmmaker has even claimed on multiple occasions that these two have ghost accounts to secretly stalk other celebs and keep a track of what is happening around them. But on Thursday, the diva decided to finally break the social media ghosting and made her Instagram debut with nothing but a boomerang of a cat. However, that was not the post that went viral. What broke the internet was Kareena Kapoor Khan’s post from next day when she shared a picture of herself dressed in a black hoodie jacket. Kareena added the caption, “The cat's out of the bag. #HelloInstagram”This week also saw the second song of Irrfan Khan-Kareena Kapoor Khan-Radhika Madan-starrer Angrezi Medium being dropped. While the original video on Youtube got millions of views, even Radhika Madan ’s post with the clip went viral. Featuring Aliaa Bhatt, Anushka Sharma, Katrina Kaif, Janhvi Kapoor, Kiara Advani, Kriti Sanon and Ananya Panday apart from Radhika herself, the clip is a really sweet one which is sure to lift your spirits. Radhika accompanied the post with a thank you note saying, “Just wanted to thank all these beautiful Kudi's for coming together as a family and supporting our film. It really means a lot.”And then there was the much anticipated ‘Sooryavanshi’ trailer launch which saw a star studded affair with Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Ranveer Singh and Katrina Kaif marking their presence as they star in the upcoming Rohit Shetty directorial. And while Mr. Punctuality aka Akshay was obviously on time, so were his costars, Ajay and Katrina, except for one mischievious youngster. No guesses for who it was! Ranveer was running late and arrived a full 40 minutes late for the event. However, he knew that keeping senior Bollywood superstars waiting was a sin of the first order and so was ready to face any punishment that would be meted out to him. And so, Aki obliged and made Ranveer do sit-ups for the delay. The video spread over social media like wild fire and we are not complaining! Sara Ali Khan , who recently wrapped up the shooting of ‘Coolie No 1’ with Varun Dhawan in Goa has been taking some much needed time off. On March 5, the actress posted two pictures of herself with brother Ibrahim Ali Khan as it was his birthday and the post went viral like nobody’s business. The Love Aaj Kal actress was seen in a two piece bikini while Ibrahim donned boxer shorts. Sara captioned the post with, “Happiest birthday Brother 🎂 🍰 🎁👫 I love you more than you know and am missing you lots today!! Wish I was with you,” making it clear that these were throwback pictures from an earlier vacation.The beginning of the week saw Neena Gupta sharing a heart-wrenching video of herself where she finally spoke out about what she went through when she dated a married man. In the clip, Neena was in Mukteshwar and spoke at length about the experience of dating a married man. While she made it all sound very simple, it must have been exactly the opposite of that. The video went viral for all the right reasons because, in her words, ‘Sach kahun toh’, it’s totally not worth getting involved with a married man!This is all we have for this week. We will see you back the next week with videos and pictures that set the internet ablaze."

As soon as I finish one, I start my next. I want to address everything... I'm still an angry man. I'll keep venting my anger through my films,' the director told in an interview.Patriarchy, in his view, 'is in our blood, in our bones'.'It has been for centuries and we don't even realize that we have it,' Sinha said.Before 'Thappad', which released on February 28, Sinha made 'Article 15' on the caste divide in 2019 and 'Mulk' on religious polarization in 2018.'Perhaps this is the most fertile time for me. I keep finding good stories so I don't see a reason not to work. I'm a workaholic and there is no other engagement in my life. I'm meeting good writers, some are one or two films old, some are new. Things are falling into place organically,' he said.The 54-year-old, who began his career in 2001 with the romantic drama ""Tum Bin' and went on to make commercial potboilers such as 'Cash', 'Dus' and ' Ra.One ' before changing gears to more meaningful cinema, said he works on two scripts simultaneously.That is why he is able to come up with at least one film a year. So, while he was making 'Article 15' with co-writer Gaurav Solanki , he was also working on the script of 'Thappad' with Mrunmayee Lagoo.""Similarly, while Mrunmayee and I were busy with 'Thappad', two other writers were writing my next two,"" he said.""I spend time with my writers, meet them at 8 in the morning to discuss what we have written. I am always working on two scripts. It takes more time between two films when you don't have a ready script,"" he added.Sinha credits the women in his team for 'Thappad', hailed as a landmark film by many critics. The Taapsee Pannu-starrer is about a homemaker whose life falls apart when her corporate executive husband slaps her in a party.According to Sinha, the women in his crew ensured he didn't make mistakes while telling the story of ""just a slap"".""After the #MeToo movement, I told my team to hire as many women as possible. So there are always a lot of women in my team. I talk to them and they read the script and come up with their own suggestions.""While constructing a shot, if I have some confusion or a question, I discuss with them and try to find a solution. The only credit I take is that I'm receptive to their ideas.""His late mother did not connect with his earlier films but would have loved 'Thappad', he said.In 2010, he started cooking as a hobby. But it took his mother to make him realize that cooking can be a chore if you have to do it four times a day, everyday.""I realized this woman wakes up when we are fast asleep to cook for us and then leave for her school. She was a teacher. This affected me even as a child. Thankfully, I never saw any kind of violence, physical or otherwise, but yes, we are all misogynists.""My father would carry his own plate from the table and made the morning cup of tea... There were no words like 'feminists' and 'chivalry' in our lives then... but it must have subliminally affected me that my father was like that. Still the cooking chores were done by my mother,"" he said.Though the director does not mention it, the protagonist Amrita's father, played by Kumud Mishra , may have something to do with Sinha's personal experience. He is gentle and large hearted, quotes poetry, makes his own tea, loves his family and has a special corner in his heart for his daughter.""The film talks about 'anupayukt' (unsuitable) men but that doesn't mean there are no good men around. I wanted to have one good man in the middle but realized that he was too sweet... That is why, I wanted to say that even he made a mistake.""A revealing conversation between Mishra's character and his wife, played by Ratna Pathak Shah , tells the audience how he overlooked her musical aspirations even while being the caring husband.Sinha said 'Mulk', 'Article 15' and 'Thappad' are not a trilogy, but the success of the first two gave him the confidence to tackle the latest.""When I made 'Mulk', a courtroom drama, it was a little verbose because there were things I had to say. So it ended up speaking more."

Talking about it, she said, “It was a nostalgic experience. During the shoot, many books that I carried in my bag or that I saw in the library of the school that we shot at were the ones that I used to read when I was in school. So, whenever we had a break between shots, I would read them and go back to the time when I had a photographic memory of textbook pages, which had important answers. While playing Tarika, I revisited the innocence and the unadulterated vibe of that age when you’re so eager to explore life. It was overwhelming to be in that school uniform. As a person, I was not like Tarika. But I was as good at memorising lessons, which comes in handy even today when I have to remember my scripts. I was a good dancer and I used to take classes when I was in the 10th grade. My parents wanted me to focus on my studies and then spare time for dance lessons. This character gave me a chance to revisit that time in my life when everything was so simple.”"

', 'My Name Is Khan' among several others. From being the Bollywood heroine who broke all stereotypes of image to become a superstar. She said she is at a point in her career where impact of the character matters more than length of the role.In a three-decade mainstream career in Bollywood, she has proved herself as an actor and a star time and again. What does she look for in a script now? 'The magic,' she replied. ""Give me three scenes and I can create magic. I do not need a title role where all I have is the title, a poster and, in the whole film, I am furniture. If you look at my career and choice of roles, I have always done something where the character has an emotional graph, something substantial. I want to create a memory in the mind of the audience through the characters I portray. That is precisely the reason I keep saying that I have to like the script. If the character I am offered is not impacting me how will it impact the audience? So, if you think I am choosy, I would say, I am living the life of an artist that I have earned through years of hard work,"" Kajol added, while speaking to media agency.Starting her career in 1992 with ' Bekhudi ', Kajol has bagged numerous popular awards and also proved her versatility with a variety of roles. She was equally impressive as the murdered Isha Diwan in the whodunit 'Gupt' and the tomboy-turned-glam girl in 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. She excelled as the mother who lost her only child in religious hatred in 'My Name Is Khan', and she exuded effortless ease playing twin siblings of diametrically opposite nature in 'Dushman'. Indeed, there is hardly any experimentation that she is scared to try out.Does success gave her confidence to do so? ""Success surely gives you confidence, and financial independence also gives you the courage to live life on your own terms. But I have to mention that my idea of success is not just about earning fame and money. I know people who are successful by the definition of society but they are turning out to become people who suffocate in their own image. For me, I have to become the person I like in the first place. After a point, fame and money become inconsequential,"" replied the actress.She added: ""I feel I am successful not because of the fame and money but because of the individual I have become. The family I have, my kids, my husband, my choice of films success is a combination of everything to me.""Asked about if her criteria of choosing a film have changed, Kajol replied: ""My choices of films are the reflection of what I believe in. That is how I can be honest with my choices as a performing artist. I know there are some mitigating circumstances under which one has to do a film. Having said that, I am practising my choice because I am not working just to earn money. I rather earned this luxury through my body of work in the nineties. I am fortunate to have that financial freedom that many artists do not have, so I might as well utilize it to be a part of narratives that are thought-provoking."""

Interestingly it was Coronavirus and he also wore a mask.”The photo of the comic book featured a character in named “Coronavirus” wearing a gold mask. This issue was reportedly published three years before the deadly Wuhan outbreak. In the comic strip, Asterix and the Chariot Race, Coronavirus featured as a masked villain taking part in the race.

She has directed and acted in over 40 films in 10 languages, many of which dealt with inter-communal political tensions in India including ones based on the communal riots of 2002. Calling for a greater space for the female gaze, her stories are considered fresh and infused with energy that triggers the change. Alankrita Srivastava With her bombastic debut movie, ‘ Lipstick Under My Burkha ’, she dealt with issues about female sexuality and existence that’s rarely discussed. In the last episode of a hit show, the filmmaker changed forever how gay love stories were depicted on screen. The film's lead played by Arjun Mathur and his lover played by Vikrant Massey , Alankrita brought into the bold storytelling that was missing.Rima DasAfter her much-acclaimed film had been declared India’s official entry to the Academy Awards in 2019, and the festival audience wouldn't stop raving about her film. National award-winning filmmaker Rima Das who is a self-taught director hailing from a small town in Assam has proved the value of cinematic mettle. She single-handedly directed, shot, edited, produced and did the production design of her voices, giving voice to dreams of common people.Actor-director Geetu known for helming a critically acclaimed film, which was India’s official entry for the Oscars in 2015, returned with another vividly wild film this year. Refusing to create an issue of the nativity, the actor held her guns in making movies in the language she envisions them in so not much is lost in translation.Credited to have created the inventive and whimsical sci-fi film, starring Vikrant Massey and Shweta Tripathi , the filmmaker is India's only sci-fi director currently. Endeavoring to re-contextualize the same problems of our society but from a completely fresh perspective, her films are rooted in folklore and mythology and have the technicality of Hollywood films made on a slim budget, she is a true believer in stories and how by localizing sci-fi movies, the market and consumer base for it will expand."

On her recent turn on a show, the actress revealed that she fooled reporters to stop them from reaching the venue of her wedding with Ajay Devgn on February 24, 1999. With a twinkle in her eye, the actress relayed, “If I didn’t disclose the venue, they would have dug out the information from somewhere else. I thought I’d give them a wrong address so they would stop looking for it.”When asked if the rumours, that she forayed into acting only because her mother signed her first two films on her behalf, were true, Kajol shrugged it off. “It’s completely false and baseless. My mother is very supportive and has always guided me in the right direction.”The actress went on to reveal, that apart from acting, she can also knit. “I love knitting stuff for my family, especially the crochet knit. I had made blankets and T-shirts for my children Nysa and Yug in their childhood. I have also made two t-shirts for Ajay and a long jacket for my sister (Tanisha) as well,” she informed, adding she still picks up the needle whenever she has the time."

Now, she is gearing up for her third outing,'Angrezi Medium', with Irrfan Khan Kareena Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia In the film, Radhika plays a teenager who aspires to go abroad for higher studies. “Both Tarika and I are big-time dreamers. I wanted to go to Broadway to learn dance but acting happened and the plan took a back seat,” she informs, quick to point out that the common ground between them ends there.The actress goes on to share that she discovered veganism while trying to get into the skin of her character. “Food is an important tool for our mindset. We hear it all the time but for the first time, I experienced that unadulterated food leads to an unadulterated mindset. I am a vegan now. The entire prep was an adventurous journey,” she says.Working with Irrfan, who plays her father in the Homi Adajania directorial, was another high point for Radhika. “His performances in 'Maqbool' and 'Paan Singh Tomar' are my favourites. We met a couple of times for readings before shooting began. The first thing I said to him was, ‘Hello pappa’. He is extremely sweet, warm and endearing,” smiles Radhika.The 24-year-old actress goes on to inform that the film’s schedule was planned keeping Irrfan’s health in mind. “He and Homi had been co-ordinating before work on the film started. On the set, Irrfan sir gave his 200 per cent. There was an amazing energy around because of him,” she reminisces, equally kicked about being on the cover of Bhardwaj’s book on her debut film, which was directed by the filmmaker-author and co-starred Sanya Malhotra. “It was humbling to see my face on the book. It details the entire process of making the film,” she informs.While she would like to collaborate with VB again, Radhika reveals that she is constantly in touch with him. “I love him, and he loves me. I make it a point to meet him and Vasan ('Bala', 'Mard Ko Dard Nahin Hota' director) sir every time I am starting work on a new project. Their blessings are important to me; both are my mentors.”"

The actress’s father Boney and elder brother Arjun were also present. “I was supposed to work on my birthday, but the shoot got cancelled,” she smiles, adding that nothing else makes her as happy as being in front of the camera. “I am consumed by my passion for acting, which gives meaning to my life. I feel like I am wasting time if not investing in my craft.”Reminiscing the days when her late actress-mother Sridevi, and father would go the extra mile to make the day special, Janhvi says, “They would decorate my room with balloons and make everything feel special, be it the conversations on the couch or the cake-cutting. Mom would make me feel pampered. Dad does it every day even now.”The birthday girl insists that materialistic gifts don’t interest her. It’s the time spent with her loved ones that makes a difference. “A few years ago, some friends took me to Alibaug. There was lots of cake, while one friend recited a poem for me. It was the first time I was out of town for an entire day,” she recalls.On the work front, Janhvi will next be seen in 'Roohi-Afzana', which is a part of Dinesh Vijan’s horror universe that kicked off with 'Stree' in 2018. In it, she plays a double role and shares screen space with Rajkummar Rao for the first time. Ask her if attempting two roles in a film was challenging and she says, “I had to push myself physically and emotionally as the characters are opposites in terms of physicality, mannerism and even intention. It was liberating to do this in the early days of my career. It also made me feel comfortable in front of the camera.”Janhvi also has debutant director Sharan Sharma’s 'Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl' in the offing, in which she portrays the titular character, the first Indian woman air-force pilot, along with Srividya Rajan, in combat (during the 1999 Kargil War). “It’s an opportunity of a lifetime; she is so inspiring,” the actress exclaims.And what about being in a Karan Johar directorial for the first time? While Janhvi is unwilling to talk about 'Takht', which also features Ranveer Singh Kareena Kapoor , Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pedneker and Anil Kapoor, and goes on the floors this month, she wants to end the conversation with an eye on the future. “I want to do a love story as I am a romantic at heart and tend to romanticise things in my head. I haven’t had a chance to do another love story after 'Dhadak'. I want to do the montage cuts and love songs again,” she concludes."

The actress, who started prepping for the role two months ago, has continued training at a school ground in Haridwar, where she is shooting for Vinil Mathew’s romance-thriller 'Haseen Dillruba'.“The students were so inspired by Taapsee that the school named their gym after her. She trains for two hours every day for better stamina and the body language of an athlete,” informs director Akarsh Khurana , adding that a diction expert has also been appointed to teach the actress colloquial terms and phrases in Kutchi. The first half of the film is set in Kutch, where shooting begins on April 1. “We’ll be shooting in three chunks. After Kutch, we head to Delhi in May and Dehradun and Mussoorie in June. Rann of Kutch is also an important part of our schedule. In fact, the first schedule starts with a song, which is set in the Rann Utsav,” Akarsh reveals.The film also features Aparshakti Khurana and Bhavesh Joshi Superhero actor Priyanshu Painyuli . The screenplay is written by Aniruddha Guha, while Kanika Dhillon has penned the dialogue. “Aniruddha did a lot of research, speaking to several athletes and people from the athletics federation. Amit (Trivedi), who is composing the music, is excited about exploring the local music of Kutch,” Akarsh adds.The director goes on to clarify that the Ronnie Screwvala, Neha Anand and Pranjal Khandhdiya production is more of a drama than a sports story. “The sport forms the backdrop of the film, while the story narrates an athlete’s journey from anonymity to fame and how she gets caught up in the politics and corruption of the sports system along the way,” he reasons.When asked about the inspiration behind his heroine, the director shares that the character is fictional, but the story was a culmination of several real-life incidents involving female athletes from India and abroad. Besides 'Rashmi Rocket', Taapsee also has 'Shabaash Mithu' in the works, which is based on cricketer Mithali Raj The actress had first heard the basic story idea of 'Rashmi Rocket' from her South filmmaker-friend Nanda Periyasamy. “And she approached me to direct it after watching my last film 'Karwaan' (featuring Irrfan Khan and Dulquer Salmaan),” Akarsh signs off."

Coronavirus is now a reality in India, with 29 cases confirmed all over the nation by the first half of Thursday. Stars and filmmakers across Bollywood and the southern film industry have united to spread awareness about the disease and stop panic on social media.Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu shared a list of dos and don'ts on Instagram story. The list includes observing good personal hygiene, frequently washing hands with soap, covering one's mouth while sneezing and coughing, refraining from consumption of raw or under cooked meat, refraining from travelling to farms, live animal markets or where animals are slaughtered.Bollywood superstar Salman Khan has suggested avoiding handshake or hugging. He has insisted on traditional Indian ways of greeting like salaam and namaste. Sharing Salman's post on Instagram, actress Bipasha Basu wrote: ""With Awareness and good hygiene we can fight anything. Well said @beingsalmankhan.""Not mentioning coronavirus directly, director Rohit Shetty has reposted nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar 's post pertaining to ""Common sense to deal with uncommon threats"" on Instagram. The post offers tips like having amla daily, consumption of turmeric milk at night, hot water bath with neem leaves, washing hands before eating and refraining from shaking hands.Veteran actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha took to Twitter to spread awareness through a series of tweets. In one tweet, he has appealed to all to stop rumor mongering.""From #SafdarjungHospital & to all other hospitals. The fear that has gripped the city/nation should be cleared out by the media who can play an important role by preventing outright negative & fake news. Rumour mongering must stop. Media can be positive & responsible in these fearful & stressful times. They can also be very helpful in keeping the matter calm & fruitful. #CaronaVirus""Advising all to drink hot water in another tweet, he wrote: ""This time, the Wuhan virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed at a temperature of 26-27 degrees. Therefore, drink more hot water. You can tell your friends and relatives to drink more hot water to prevent it. Go under the Sun. It has been cold recently, and drinking hot water is also very comfortable. It is not a cure and is good for the body. Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink ice, remember!""Director Ram Gopal Varma took to Twitter to sarcastically express: ""If there are much lesser number of cases in India, it either means we are just plain lucky or that coronavirus doesn't like Indians much.""Director Anubhav Sinha also shared the same point as Ram Gopal Varma that the number of cases in India is very low and requested everyone not to panic.He tweeted: ""Influenza kills more people every year. We are panicking because we think this shit is new and there is no cure for it. But the truth is that the mortality rate is very low. So... #DontPanic #Corona BUT #TakeCare.""Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri tweeted: ""A doctor told me that people who stay too much in central AC environment have a higher chance of catching Corona Virus than those who stay in open and natural environment. By that logic urban areas are more susceptible than villages."""

Rai, who became famous as a director with his Kanpur-set ' Tanu Weds Manu ' films and has backed movies such as 'Tumbbad', 'Manmarziyaan' and ' Shubh Mangal Saavdhan ' series, said if he likes the one-line idea of a story, he is up a two-hour narration.The approach, he said, has helped him meet talented people such as writers Kanika Dhillion and Hitesh Kewalya, and actors Ayushmann Khurrana and Taapsee Pannu ""I come from nothing and that makes me connect with a lot of people. There is no formality in meeting with people. I don't doubt creative people. I have been lucky that my instincts about them have worked so far, whether it has to do with casting or other creative aspects of filmmaking,"" Rai told in an interview.'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan', which tackles the romance between two men in a small town India, has done well at the box office and is one of the handful of mainstream movies to talk about the issue.Rai said they started the project with good intentions, which is what matters the most when one is talking about an issue.""The intention behind making this film was that it is the right time. We also evolved during this process. We have a responsibility towards the medium that we are using. It should give something to the people along with entertainment,"" he said.The filmmaker recalled how people around him thought he should not get involved with 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan', the first in the series, as it dealt with a taboo subject like erectile dysfunction, owing to his family-friendly image.""But the reason behind making that film and this one was to bring two generations close and talk about issues that we actually don't. The reason was to address the communication gap and shorten that,"" he added, describing why his stories are set around families.Rai, who considers directors Sai Paranjpye , Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Raj Kapoor among his inspirations, said he will continue to set his stories in the middle class, small town India.""I come from the middle class, I have never wanted to go away from that. I may have a bigger car and a better house now, but my heart and soul is still very middle class. This is why my stories find that milieu.""I am not saying I am depicting the world of the '80s when I was growing up. I am taking it further.

So just after finishing my graduation from International film and media institution, I started working on production, assisting, and editing among other things. I think as long as your mind is engaged; you do not get into that negative zone, and stay hopeful,"" Pavail told media agency.The actor, who worked with Amitabh Bachchan in the TV show in 2014, feels fortunate to have acted for filmmakers as Zoya Akhtar, Anubhav Sinha Ekta Kapoor , and Anurag Kashyap among others.""It is a dream for any actor to get a call from filmmakers whom he has admired forever. I think in my journey so far, I have manifested everything well, because I only looked at the opportunity most of the time rather than the length of my role,"" said Pavail, who went through extensive theater training under the mentorship of an icon like Naseruddin Shah before entering Bollywood.In 'Thappad', he plays the husband of the female protagonist Amrita, played by Taapsee Pannu . What was the best takeaway from the film for him? ""I think the biggest lesson that I have learnt through the process of filming 'Thappad' is, not hurting the dignity of the other person in a relationship, and that means in any relationship be it with parents, childhood friends, girlfriend or people who genuinely care,"" replied Pavail.""Earlier I used to miss out on my mother's call when I was busy. It is a common thing that we all do, thinking, 'mummy hi to hai, baad mein baat kar loonga (it's only mummy, I will speak to her later)'. It is true that at times when we are dealing with a tough situation, answering 'kya kar rahe ho beta (what's up son)' might just irritate. But now I think from their point of view. For my Ma, at times she just wants to hear my voice, and not taking her call conveys that she is not important in my life. It is important not to take our loved ones for granted,"" Pavail signed off."

They are blind and ignorant. Akin to nazis.”On the work front, Sonam will be working with ‘ Kahaani ’ director Sujoy Ghosh on a film reportedly titled ‘Blind’.

'WAR':

'BAAGHI 3':

The market chase sequence was tricky. We could not have too many rehearsals since we were shooting on the streets of Bangkok. We reached the location, figured out the obstacles and improvised there and then, deciding that I could run along that wall, jump from this point to that, manoeuvre my way through the bustling crowds without inconveniencing anyone, then, suddenly, spring an attack. It was literally action on the run. The climax threw another challenge to reach the antagonist, martial arts expert Sudheer Babu at the top of the building, I had to take on opponents from different nationalities with their own specialized skills on each floor. With several fighters coming at me all at once, we had to choreograph the fight in such a way that they looked fast, clean and as graceful as possible. There was a lot of give-and-take with fighters as I had to anticipate their reactions to say, a certain kick of mine, and retaliate accordingly. And it was all happening on the spot!The biggest dare in this film was undoubtedly the climax because it was set in a jungle. We were shooting in the hot and humid Krabi and it got really sweaty and sticky. My fighting style also was a lot fiercer in Part 2, necessitating contact with the fighters while brandishing weapons, like guns and knives. For certain shots, I had to swing from a rope while balancing a heavy gun on my right arm and maintaining posture. For others, I had to go for the kill with a gun in each hand... Phew!My introduction sequence was two-and-a-half minutes of continuous fighting so I had to remember when to crash through a sheet of glass, how to fall and where to jump onto someone, pulling the chandelier after me. And all this was done in one single take. In the climax, I was fighting my hero, Hrithik Roshan sir, so the pressure mounted and how! It was literally 'Krrish' vs 'Baaghi'.Every action sequence upped the ante. It got even scarier because we were doing everything live, with real weapons, tanks, helicopters and cars. I ran through 97-98 blasts; explosions happening behind me, on the sides and also in front of me. The wind made it more unpredictable as the flames could suddenly turn towards me. Plus, we were shooting in minus 5 degrees and I was running bare-bodied. The local Serbian crew, who were used to the sub-zero temperature and were still all bundled up, would look at me with awe, wondering if I was a man or a beast. It was truly a superhuman feat!While we were filming, the adrenaline rush kept me going, but once I returned to my hotel room, I had absolutely no energy left. My team would put me on the bed and for an hour, I wouldn’t have the strength to move a muscle. Then, somehow, I would roll into the bathroom, take a hot water shower and then, go in for physiotherapy every day, before calling it a night. It was immense hard work and sheer torture because we were racing against time. We shot 150 days of action in just 70."

Even when she’s not in couture, she’s the best-dressed woman in the room, who makes for a smart, on-point conversationalist. Kareena Kapoor Khan talks to BT about Angrezi Medium, what drives her movie choices today and how, over time, she has become a relaxed and calm actor. Excerpts:I agree that it’s a small role, but I’d never played something like this before. I was in London for two months with Saif (Ali Khan, husband) while he was shooting for Jawaani Jaaneman when this came my way. They needed about a fortnight of my time. It sounded like a cool film to be a part of. Also, who wants to miss a chance to work with such a fantastic cast. Most importantly, it was the greed to work with Irrfan that got me going instantly. The story draws parallels between Radhika Madan ’s relationship with Irrfan, and the one I share with Dimple Kapadia in the film, who is my mother. It subtly talks about the kind of equation parents and kids share. In the brief screen time I have, my character has a brilliant arc. I couldn’t have turned this down. I loved working with Irrfan, he’s such a delight. Radhika is fantastic, and I’ve been a huge fan of Deepak Dobriyal ’s work since Omkara (2006). He’s magical. These guys are on some other plane; you stop feeling like an actor when you see them work.Dimple aunty is close to my family, and she’s actually seen me grow up. It was an honour to work with her and play her daughter. She was spectacular to work with. The way we did some of the emotionally challenging scenes — they turned out to be among my career’s best shots. There’s a portion where she confronts me which was quite tricky to get right, but it went off so well. It takes a performer like her to make it that much more convincing. I think a director also has a lot to do with how two people play out scenes. He pushes them in a particular direction, like Homi did in our case. He had lived with this script for longer than us, and he was so sure of what he wanted.No, not really. Of course, we all invest a part of ourselves in the roles we play, but I would never compare my equation with Dimple aunty in the film with what I share with my mother. My mom is the centre of my sister Lolo’s ( Karisma Kapoor ) and my universe. Our world revolves around her. Today, being a mother, I know how important a mother is to a child’s being. Our role is not restricted to feeding and bathing the child. The effect a mother has on the mind of her child runs deep. If I don’t see Taimur for two days, I feel uneasy. Sometimes, I don’t take him along when I’m shooting outdoors in another city. When I come home, the way he hugs me says a lot. His father does a great job of looking after him when I’m away, but I can see it in his eyes that he has missed me. I know that it’s going to get difficult for me to stay away from him as he grows older and starts formal school. I still have a year before that happens. I’m happy that my next film Takht will be shot in Mumbai. Being able to be around Taimur plays a big part in the way I choose my work. I can’t leave him behind. I can’t be away from my kid for too long. Sometimes, even promotions for three to four days in other cities gets to me because he’s not around.Not at all! Saif and I have our independent relationships with Homi and Dinesh. Saif didn’t even come on the set when I was shooting for this film. In fact, when I told him about the offer, he just said that I should do it and that it sounds like a good role and a cool film. Saif is not someone who believes in telling me what I should do and what I shouldn’t. As long as we have our time as a family, he’s not interested in what I’m doing because he trusts that I will do the right thing. To this day, Saif has not even asked me how it was to work on this film. He just asked me, “Are you having fun? I said, ‘Yeah!” and he said, “Cool.” He does not get into the details, and we don’t talk about my career, anyway. Yes, we definitely discuss his career a lot. This has worked beautifully for us.It’s hard to believe, but there was no plan whatsoever to be seen as a glamourous woman, ever. It just happened! I started off with an unconventional love story and have always been that kind of an actress. Yes, now that it’s been 20 years, people are realising it. Early on in my career, I worked in films like Chameli (2003), Dev (2004) and Yuva (2004). Obviously, the commercial films were mounted bigger, and they registered better with the audience, so the image of a diva got associated with me. As an actor, I had always wanted to do different kinds of films and I chose the best of what was offered to me. Usually, no actress agrees or chooses to do the smaller part, but I was keen to do Angrezi Medium. A few months ago, I was also the central character in Good Newwz. It’s a conscious decision to find interesting things to do. Today, I’m a relaxed and calm actor. Experiences in this insular world of films teach you a lot. You need to have a strong gut and be made of steel to survive for so long and be able to take every bottle chucked at you. That is the reason I’ve lasted for 20 years, and hopefully, will last another 20.I’ve worked in many films that he has backed as a producer over these years, but not with him as a director. It’s been a huge gap. In these years, Karan has made such different kinds of films and has worked with so many different actors. Working together will be a rude shock for both of us. He has evolved as a filmmaker, and I’m a different actor from what I used to be when I had played Poo in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Takht, which is being directed by Karan, will be a different and a special journey for us. Also, it’s a drama set in the Mughal era and we are entering into such a space for the first time. Neither of us has done this before. He will leave no stone unturned to make an absolute spectacle. We’ve locked certain looks for the initial part of the shoot. I’ll also go in for diction training. If I were to ask Karan what I should do as prep for the part, he will pull my leg and say, “Since when have you become this sort of an actor?”"

Nitesh is set to direct the trilogy , which will be shot in 3D. The live-action films, produced by Madhu Mantena , will be made in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu.""'Ramayana' is magical. It is something that we have not seen from an Indian maker. It has got a lot of magical qualities to it and the kind of forest we had, you had animals talking to us, this was something which is wonderful and it allows you to have the potential to present beautifully on screen a world that you have not seen before.""It is prep heavy film. It is very tough but gratifying if you can get it right, as you have the technology to do it,"" Nitesh told .The director was talking on the sidelines of a special screening of a short film.The challenge, Nitesh said, is to make the trilogy appealing for kids and older generation, who have grown up listening to Ramayana.""What makes it challenging that how do you tell a story to a six-year-old and retain the faith of 60-year-old. That is why it is taking time. You have to strike a balance. My nine-year-old kid has to find it exciting, they are fans of 'Avengers'.""At the same time, it needs to be exciting for my mother-in-law at a level where she would be like I have not seen 'Ramayana' in this form.

""We used to play a very nasty Holi in my childhood. People would throw eggs on me! I stopped playing Holi in class IX or X, because you become aware of how much water is wasted. It's not worth it and it damages the environment. Since then, I've only played dry Holi, I meet my family and friends and eat a lot of sweets and other dishes,"" she recalled.Does she have the Holi sweet tooth? ""I used to like gujiyas a lot but now I can't eat gujiyas due to my fitness regime. I can't play with water and colours so, I prefer working on a festival,"" she replied, while interacting with the media at an event.Sharing her thought on International Women's Day, which falls on March 8, she said: ""I don't believe in Women's Day. We don't celebrate Men's Day, so why do we have to celebrate woman on just one day? I feel we should celebrate womanhood every single day. I feel we should respect women around us and that's the most important thing. That way, we will celebrate womanhood in a far better way.""Meanwhile, Rakul Preet has a busy year ahead, after impressing all with her roles in 'Marjaavaan' and 'De De Pyaar De'.

In that particular scene , Tiger is saying the dialogue, ""If you harm my brother, I swear on my father, I will wipe out your country from the map.” (as shown in the subtitles). Reacting to the same social media users called out the makers over the dialogue and stated that it is offensive and insensitive.Lately, when the team of 'Baaghi 3' met ETimes for an exclusive interaction, we asked about Tiger about the 'wipe off' controversy and he said that it was just a scene that was taken and put into the trailer. ""Well, we totally understand why they would question that and say something like that. But in no way, were we meaning on demeaning anybody or any country for sure. It was just the scene that was taken and put into the trailer"", the actor mentioned.Adding further he averred that it was a high voltage scene of two brothers, where one had got kidnapped and the latter was ready to go to any lengths to save his elder brother. ""It's something that just came out of reflex. And I don't think that was the intention. It could be anybody, you know, the subtext of that is, if you mess with my brother, then you mess with me"", Tiger said.Watch the video here:Directed by Ahmed Khan , 'Baaghi 3' also stars Shraddha Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh Vijay Raaz and Jackie Shroff .

As we progressed on the story, we felt it is important to show the entitlement of the male population, some of them are not aware they have it... Entitlement is so deep and natural that even people who are aware can see a hint of themselves in the characters,"" the writer told in an interview.Mrunmayee, who co-wrote the film with Anubhav, said though women take care of home on their own, men assume that's solely their responsibility and they wanted to show this imbalance without underlining it.""I have seen balanced roles... My father is self-reliant. My mother was an actress and ran her home efficiently. I have seen her straddling both the worlds. That comes naturally to women but somewhere men are groomed into thinking that all of these things will be taken care of (by women). We are victims of our own conditioning,"" the writer, daughter of late Reema Lagoo , said.Mrunmayee said they left it to the audience to draw their own conclusion through Amrita's routine, which revolves around her home and husband.""Without saying anything accusatory to each other when you just show the daily routine, people draw correct inferences, both men and women. Women see how much we go behind... There is an identity struggle as 'there is no career so, at least, I will be the best housewife'.""Rather than trying to balance the power-dynamic, the the writer said they wanted to show the reality through various relationships such as Ratna Pathak Shah-Kumud Mishra and Maya Sarao-Manav Kaul.""We only tried to balance reality with craft. Vikram (the husband) is nice but when things don't go his way, he can become a different person. This comes from what he has seen, heard and his upbringing. Similarly the parents, Ratna's character never felt like saying anything to her husband as everything was going well.""We tend to overlook things and it happens in real life. Nobody is black or white. In real life, people can be more white or black.""Asked whether 'Thappad' was an extension of 2016's 'Pink', which also featured Taapsee, and had the viral dialogue on consent, 'No means no', Mrunmayee said the thought never crossed their mind.""That big line of 'No means no' never occurred to us. The idea is so strong that it seeps into you when you are not thinking about it. What we were saying (in 'Thappad')aligned beautifully with this big truth, where 'no means no' is a slogan. It reinforces our belief in that whole idea."""

The original Coolie No. 1 was itself a remake of the 1991 Telugu film of the same name. Recently, Varun Dhawan even touched Govinda’s feet at the recent Filmfare Awards, to which the actor responded emotionally. When we asked Farhad if there is any possibility of Govinda being roped in for a cameo in the remake of his hit from the 1990s, he told us, “I wish it was in the pipeline, but for now, there is no talk of Govinda being a part of Coolie No. 1.

It is good that people who say they are stressed are taking help of psychologists and learning about depression. Spreading the word helps to create awareness and further diagnosis.” Kunal who was last seen in Malang also blames it on the device that has got everybody hooked on to. He says, “We have alienated ourselves so much because of this device and the social media access we have. How can it bother somebody so much? I am surprised how people become happy seeing someone hit a ‘like’ on his or her post, when you don't even know that person, personally. Likewise, why do people get affected by trolls?” He concludes saying, It’s time we talk to people about problems instead of just relying upon hunting for solutions on search engines.”"

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday urged the Congress Working Committee ( CWC ) to hold leadership elections to ""energise workers and inspire voters"".Tharoor's appeal came in support of his party colleague and former MP Sandeep Dikshit 's remarks that the the biggest challenge the party faces is the ""leadership question"".Dikshit has accused senior leaders of failing to find a new president after all these months because they are ""scared who will bell the cat"".Reacting to the remarks, Tharoor tweeted, ""What Sandeep Dikshit said openly is what dozens of party leaders from across the country are saying privately, including many with responsible positions in the party. I renew my appeal to CWC to hold leadership elections to energise workers and inspire voters.""""Some have asked who should vote and for what. I was referring to my earlier call eight months ago for elections among the 10,000 party workers who constitute the 'AICC plus PCC delegates' list. These should be for the elected seats in the CWC as well as for the party presidency,"" Tharoor said.In an interview to PTI last year, Tharoor had said the way forward for the party could be opening up all key posts, including the CWC membership, to fresh elections which would help legitimise the incoming set of leaders.The rout in the Delhi polls has brought out the fissures within the party with several leaders openly sparring over the reasons for the party's dismal performance."

BENGALURU: Amid speculations of factionalism in ruling BJP after recent meeting of senior MLAs 'upset' over not being inducted into the BS Yediyurappa ministry, more such activities surfaced with another group discussing cabinet representation and a couple of legislators reportedly getting in touch with JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy Also, BJP legislators belonging to Panchamasali caste, a sect within the dominant Lingayat community, late on Tuesday held a meeting at a city hotel in the presence of a seer, and discussed about the representation of the community in the cabinet, party sources said.Several legislators are said to have attended the meeting in which they also discussed, among other things, about inclusion of Panchamasali community in the OBC list, and that a senior leader from the community should be made MLC.A couple of senior BJP legislators upset over not being inducted into the ministry are said to have reached out to Kumaraswamy on Tuesday night.Though JD(S) sources confirmed the MLAs contacting Kumaraswamy, it is not clear what transpired between them.The activities in the midst of the ongoing assembly session have raised eyebrows within the ruling BJP circles.Earlier, minister Jagadish Shettars meeting with senior legislators (mostly from north Karnataka ), reportedly upset over being left out in the recent cabinet expansion on Monday had sparked speculation of a revolt within the BJP.Dismissing the talk of dissidence, he, had maintained a few legislators met him regarding their constituency-related work.According to media reports, eight-time BJP MLA Umesh Katti, who is sore over not being made a minister, and Shankar Patil Munenakoppa were among those who had met Shettar 's at his residence.The development came even as an unsigned anonymous letter, calling for a change in the leadership citing Yediyurappa's age and health as the reason was widely circulated in the social media in the past few days.It called for Yediyurappa's retirement from electoral politics and suggests that he turn ""margdarshak"" (guide) for the party.Yeddyurappa will turn 77 on February 27.Amid all this, JD(S) patriarch HD Deve Gowda on Wednesday wished that the Yediyurappa government would complete its term, as it would provide him time to organise the party for the next assembly polls.My desire is that the Yediyurappa government should remain for about three years and a few months. I want time to build the party. I will never say this government has to go, because time is necessary. If the election happens in six month or one year, we will not be able to gain strength. Time is the major important factor, Gowda told reporters in Belagavi."

PATNA: With many axes to grind against Prashant Kishor , the BJP on Wednesday launched a fresh attack against the poll strategist-turned-politician whom it likened to the musclemen who having previously captured booths for their political masters, had themselves started becoming politicians in the 1990s in large numbers.A day after Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi 's caustic tweets against the expelled JD(U) leader, the alliance partner's chief whip in the Lok Sabha Sanjay Jaiswal, who also heads the state unit, came out with a Facebook post a common feature, though, being avoidance on part of both BJP leaders to mention Kishor by name.""The one who made a name for oneself by doing business with the BJP is now trying the formula of the 1990s. Burglars and robbers back then had begun to think, why capture booth for others, better to become leaders ourselves. They also met with success for some time,"" said Jaiswal.""But the public now has become far more aware. It does not vote for goons and ruffians. A 'rajnaitik dhandhebaaz' (political dealer) thinks of carving a niche for oneself with money power. Had it been possible then only those with deep pockets could become public representatives,"" he said.Jaiswal also berated Kishor's accomplishments as an election strategist, pointing out ""he seeks to remember the success of 'chai pe charcha', but wants to forget a failed venture like the 'khat pe charcha' in Uttar Pradesh which was disastrous ('khaat khadi kar di thi') for two so-called young leaders"".'Khaat pe charcha' or discussions on a cot was a public outreach program said to be masterminded for the Congress by Kishor ahead of the 2017 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. The party stitched a last-minute tie-up with the Samajwadi Party led by the then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was struggling to hold his own in the face of a revolt by his influential uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav.Yadav and Rahul Gandhi ran an energetic campaign with catchy slogans describing them as ""UP ke ladke"" (sons of UP) but the alliance was pulverized by the BJP, which pulled off a stunning victory, bagging three-fourth majority.Jaiswal also sought to twist the knife by posting ""this is the world-famous Bose speaker. Sometimes when it is used for playing music, it starts believing that it deserves the credit for the melody. It forgets that it owes its quality to its cost of production which is 10 times greater than that of other brands"".""It is an overused, poor business strategy to offer free services to whichever party is the favorite during assembly polls in a state and, after the results, claiming success by getting oneself photographed (with the winning leader),"" the BJP leader added.Starting as a campaign manager for Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha polls of 2014, Kishor thereafter collaborated with the alliance among chief minister Nitish Kumar 's JD(U), Lalu Prasad's RJD and a decadent Congress. The short-lived coalition trounced the NDA in the assembly polls in 2015.In 2017, besides UP, Kishor worked for the Congress in Punjab where the party ousted the Akali Dal-BJP coalition from power. He joined the JD(U) in September 2018 and took to aggressively strengthening the party's student unit by nibbling away the support base of ABVP, which led to much bad blood between the party headed by Nitish Kumar and the BJP.During the Lok Sabha polls, he was involved with the YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh where assembly elections were held simultaneously and saw its chief Jaganmohan Reddy's ascension to power.His clout with the Thackeray family of Shiv Sena has been blamed, from some quarters, for souring of the party's old ties with the BJP, ultimately resulting in a break-up.He had begun to attack the JD(U) after it supported the CAA and was sacked when he accused Nitish Kumar of having spoken a ""lie"" by claiming that Kishor was inducted into the party on the recommendation of Amit Shah.At his press conference here on Tuesday, Kishor said that he could not reconcile to Kumar's devotion towards Gandhi and his association with ""Godsewadis"" alluding to the Sangh Parivar's association with the Mahatma's assassin."

SECUNDERABAD: Union minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said that terror has no religion and condemned what he said was a ""conspiracy"" by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the Congress party to raise the ""bogey of Hindu terror "" in the country.Goyal while speaking on the reported excerpt from the ex-Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria's book that Ajmal Kasab would have died as Samir Dinesh Chaudhari ""with a red thread tied around his wrist"" had LeT succeeded in their plan, said: ""Why is Maria ji speaking these things now? He should have said that when he was the police commissioner. According to the service rules, if some information is with senior police officers, they should take action on it.""Ajmal Kasab was part of the group of terrorists who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Kasab, a Pakistani national, was caught alive and was later hanged.""UPA and Congress conspired ... at that time we saw another example of lies when they tried to raise the false bogey of Hindu terror. I condemn Congress and others who tried to mislead the nation over Hindu terror, for which they had to face consequences in 2014 and 2019. Terror has no religion. A terrorist is a terrorist,"" Goyal added."

PATNA: Election strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor on Tuesday questioned the Nitish Kumarl, even as he sneered at the chief minister for making ideological compromises to stay in an alliance with the BJP.Kishor, who has been vocal about his opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and wasin January, said Nitish Kumar needs to spell out whether he is with the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi or those who support Nathu Ram Godse.Kishor's remarks on Nitish Kumar evoked angry reaction from the JD(U), which advised the poll strategist to devote his time to his ""business"" instead of dabbling in politics.""He should keep batting for the Aam Aadmi Party. It's better for him to devote his time to furthering his 'vyavsaya' (business). Politics is not his cup of tea,"" party spokesman K C Tyagi said.When pointed out that Kishor had worked for several parties and leaders in the past, Tyagi called it ""unethical"".Earlier, addressing a crowded press conference, the first since his expulsion from the JD(U), Kishor said, ""Nitish ji has always said that he cannot leave the ideals of Gandhi, JP and Lohiya... At the same time, how can he be with the people who support the ideology of Godse. Both cannot go together. If you want to stay with the BJP, I don't have any problem with it but you cannot be on both sides.""""There has been a lot of discussion between me and Nitish ji on this. He has his thought process and I have mine. There have been differences between him and me that the ideologies of Godse and Gandhi cannot stand together. As the leader of the party you have to say which side you are on,"" he added.In a direct assault on Kumar's model of governance, Kishor said Bihar was the poorest state in 2005 and continues to be so.""There has been development in Bihar during the last 15 years, but the pace has not been as it should have,"" the former JD(U) leader said.He challenged Kumar to a debate with him in an open forum on data points pertaining to the state's development.""People are asking what has Kumar done for Bihar's development and what will he do if his JD(U) wins the upcoming state polls,"" he said.Kishor, the architect of several successful political campaigns, announced the 'Baat Bihar ki' programme, aimed at making Bihar one of the 10 best states in the country. It will be launched on February 20.He said he will work towards developing young leaders in the state.Kishor, along with senior JD-U leader Pavan Varma were expelled on January 29 for questioning the party's stand over the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The party had also accused Kishor of using ""insulting words"" against the Bihar chief minister."

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday denied being angry with Congress general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia , who last week threatened to hit the streets against the state government over non-fulfillment of promises made in the poll manifesto.""When I have never been angry with (former chief minister and BJP national vice-president) Shivraj Singh Chouhan , how come I can be with Scindia,"" Nath told reporters here on the sidelines of a programme, when asked about his party colleague.While mentioning Chouhan, he was apparently referring to the frequent criticism of the state Congress government by the senior BJP leader.At a public rally in Tikamgarh last Thursday, Scindia threatened that he would hit the streets if promises made in the Congress' manifesto before the 2018 Madhya Pradesh polls and demands of guest teachers in the state are not fulfilled.Responding to it, Nath on Saturday said, ""Toh woh utar jaaye (let him do so).""Later on Sunday, Scindia reiterated he is a public servant and will hit the streets if promises made in the poll manifesto are not fulfilled, but also said there is a need to be patient with the Kamal Nath government as it has completed only a year.Scindia was one of the front-runners for the post of Madhya Pradesh chief minister after the Congress defeated the BJP in the assembly polls held in December 2018.The Congress, however, decided to go with senior leader Kamal Nath, leaving several in the Scindia camp unhappy.Scindia later lost the Lok Sabha polls last year from his home turf Guna.In Video: Amid tussle, MP CM Kamal Nath says he's not upset with Jyotiraditya Scindia"

NEW DELHI: Poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Tuesday launched the 'Baat Bihar Ki' campaign and said he would work towards making Bihar one of the 10 best states in the country.Targeting Nitish Kumar , Kishor said the ideological positioning of the JD(U) was the main cause of conflict with the chief minister and that the campaign, starting from February 20, will reach out to people who believe there is need of a new leadership in Bihar.Addressing a press briefing, he said his relation with Nitish Kumar has not been purely political. ""Nitish ji treated me like a son. I have immense respect for him. I will not question his decision. It was his prerogative to keep me in or out of the party,"" he added.Saying that their differences did not start just a month ago, the political strategist added that the JD(U) was not taking a clear stand on the ideology of Gandhi and Godse. ""For me Gandhi ji and Godse cannot go together,"" he added.Kishor said the other point of contention was JD(U)'s decision to align with the BJP. ""Nitish Kumar's positioning with respect to the BJP changed over the time. Bihar needs a firm leader.""""We also differed on the citizenship law ,"" he said.""Development did take place in Bihar. But the pace of development wasn't fast enough to transform the state. Did Bihar get special status? Nitish Kumar urged the Centre to give central status to Patna university but it didn't happen,"" he said while taking a dig at the BJP.The Nitish government failed to provide good education in Bihar, couldn't provide electricity at household-level, he said. ""In various parameters, Bihar lags far behind all other states. Bihar was poorest state in 2005 and continues to be so. There is no one to question Nitish Kumar's governance model,"" Kishor said.Kishor’s political advocacy group I- PAC handled Narendra Modi 's Prime Ministerial campaign in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Nitish Kumar’s chief ministerial candidature in Bihar in 2015. Later, I- PAC worked for Congress in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. It also worked for Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh, Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi and Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal.Before I-PAC started working with Reddy’s YSR Congress, Kishor was inducted into JD(U) in September 2018 and made party’s national vice-president a month later.Though JD(U) national president Nitish had called Kishor “future of politics”, things came to such an extent between the two in little over a year that the latter was removed from JD(U) on January 29 on charges of crossing party lines by making statements against Nitish.In Video: Poll strategist Prashant Kishor begins new innings with 'Baat Bihar Ki'"

NEW DELHI: In what is seen as a veiled reference to the ongoing agitations against CAA and NRC, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Monday recalled that unlike Mahatma Gandhi who held himself responsible for the movements waged under his leadership and would not hesitate to make amends, nobody came forward if agitations in contemporary times took wrong turns and went berserk.“If anything went wrong with agitations led by Gandhiji , he used to repent. It is not that he didn’t commit mistakes. However, he was fearless and used to make amends. There is none to regret if anything goes wrong in today’s agitations. If a situation emerges when there is threat to law and order situation, then none regrets. People are beaten, shot or arrested and they are made to suffer. But the sponsors of such agitations either win or lose,” Bhagwat said while releasing a book ‘Gandhi Ko Samajhney Ka Yahi Samay’ (It’s Time to Understand Gandhi), authored by former NCERT chairman J S Rajput"

RANCHI: After joining the BJP , former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi on Monday asked the minority community not to ""fear"" the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and called upon party workers to drive out the horror from their minds.Marandi said the CAA is for Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis who had faced persecution for several years in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and there was no reason for the natives to fear it.""The politics in the country over CAA is instilling fear. I tell the minority community, there is nothing to fear. It is our responsibility to remove the fear from their minds,"" Marandi said at the ""Milan Samaroh"" (merger ceremony).The JVM(P) merged with the BJP on Monday, giving stimulus to the saffron party smarting from defeat in the November-December 2019 state assembly polls.Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda were present on the occasion.Marandi, the chief minister of Jharkhand from November 2000 to March 2003, said he toured several places in the last 14 years, travelling 6 to 7 lakh km, ""and what I experienced is that leadership is confined to family with political parties having no ideology"".""Only the BJP is a worker-based party and an ideology-based party. So my 'pasand' (likeness) is towards it, so I returned,"" Marandi said.Asserting that his decision to return to the saffron party was not sudden, Marandi said the BJP leaders had been in touch with him ever since he left the party in September 2006.""But due to my zidd (stubborness), I did not return. Amit Shah ji had even sent an emissary, Sunil Tiwari, during Rajya Sabha polls, asking me to return, but I refused,"" Marandi said.To media queries on what position he expected to hold in the BJP, he said, ""Even when I joined politics I never asked the party (for any position). Today also I assure that whatever responsibility the party gives me, even if asked for 'jhadoo laga ne ke liye' (sweeping), I will do it.""Taking a swipe at the Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand, Marandi said, ""Governance on Twitter will not hold much time. The people will drive you out. The people want peace, as peace and progress go together.""He assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the BJP would be ""stronger"" with the merger of his Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) with the BJP.Marandi is four-time former MP and also served in the cabinet of late Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He won the Dhanwar assembly segment on JVM-P symbol, winning for the first time after floating the party.Pradip Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey have also won the November-December assembly elections on the same symbols.Later, the two MLAs were expelled by the party for anti-party activities."

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A war of words broke out between Congress leaders Milind Deora and Ajay Maken on Twitter after Milind praised the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government for doubling its revenue, drawing a strong retort from the former Delhi Congress chief.Maken criticised Deora for his ""half-baked facts"" and said he may leave the party if he wished to. The party cautioned all its leaders to introspect their own responsibilities instead of attacking each other in public.Deora, the former Mumbai Congress chief, in a Twitter post on Monday said, ""Sharing a lesser known and welcome fact the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government doubled its revenues to Rs 60,000 crore and maintained a revenue surplus over the last 5 years.""""Food for thought: Delhi is now one of India's most fiscally prudent governments,"" the former Lok Sabha member added.However, this did not go down well with Maken, who hit back on Twitter, saying, ""Brother, you want to leave Congress. Please do - Then propagate half baked facts!""However, let me share even lesser know facts-1997-98-BE(Revenue) 4,073cr, 2013-14-BE (Revenue) 37,459cr. During Congress Govt Grew at 14.87% CAGR, 2015-16 BE 41,129 and 2019 -20 BE 60,000 AAP Gov 9.90% CAGR,"" he said.Deora again hit back at Maken saying, ""Brother, I would never undermine Sheila Dikshit's stellar performance as Delhi CM. That's your specialty.""Saying it's never too late to change, Deora tweeted, ""Instead of advocating an alliance with AAP, if only you had highlighted Sheila ji's achievements, Congres would've been in power today.""Sheila Dikshit, who died in July last, served as Delhi's chief minister for 15 years from 1998 to 2013.Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the party had unequivocally told all its Delhi leaders to introspect their roles and responsibilities.Aam Aadmi Party president Kejriwal was sworn in as the chief minister of Delhi for the third time on Sunday, after his party got a landslide victory in the Assembly polls.""Congress leaders in the rest of India commenting upon issues outside their states, need to look at their own performances, their own responsibilities and their own commitment to the party.""How much has the Congress gained in their own respective areas or under their own leadership? I urge each one of the Congress leaders, that they should concentrate first their role and responsibility on strengthening the Congress in their respective constituency and the state that they come from,"" Surjewala told reporters.He said the day they will be able to do so, they will be making positive yeoman's contribution to not only the growth of the party but also the politics of pluralism and inclusiveness that they all espouse.Surjewala said sometimes in the heat of the moment, people make remarks but every such statement is not treated as an affront.""This advisory to all the seasoned and young leaders should help them look at their own role and responsibility,"" he said in comments that are considered to be a reprimand to all leaders fighting with each other in public.When asked about friction within the leaders in various states, Surjewala said, ""We hope the new leaders will be leading the Congress party in the state of Karnataka soon.""On the war of words between Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia, he said they are amongst the most dedicated leaders of the party and anybody coming with a grievance to a leader is required to be heard and their grievance articulated in the mechanism created by the Congress.""What you see as a spat is actually a manufactured one from an outsider's perspective. I think the equation between Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia is absolutely cordial and great and both are working towards strengthening the party.""I see no reason for the stories that are being planted in a systematic fashion in a section of the media, I reject these stories completely,"" he said.Surjewala said in Delhi, the contest was between Kejriwal's 'Dangal' Delhi and Modi's 'Danga' Delhi and if someone changed the ground situation in Delhi, it was the Congress under Sheila Dikshit.""Economic activity is the highest in Delhi, being the national capital and tax collection rise of 18 per cent rise is natural. Please do not tell how much revenue was generated, but Kejriwal should tell what has been done towards public welfare. He has won, we accept the verdict while bowing.""But, did Kejriwal add a single litre of water for Delhi ... did he produce one more unit of power in Delhi or even made one new flyover, or added new Metro lines or added another university or hospital in Delhi. If he has not done anything of this, he did benefit from the structure laid down by Sheila Dikshit,"" he asked.""Sometimes, the truth loses but the fact is that the truth cannot be defeated. In Delhi, the truth is the Congress has lost but we have not been defeated,""he claimed."

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal was sworn in for a third consecutive term as chief minister of Delhi, along with his cabinet, by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Sunday afternoon at Ramlila Maidan as a capacity crowd cheered. Addressing the people later, he attributed his overwhelming victory to the common man of Delhi, making the Aam Aadmi Party ’s “new kind of politics” the centrepiece of the celebrations.“The people of Delhi have given birth to new politics in the country. This is the politics of work — schools, hospital, 24-hour and cheap power supply, water, good roads, women’s security, a corruptionfree city — politics of 21st century India,” he said, in remarks that were the closest he came to making a national pitch. He said this had started resonating across the country and other states were either emulating it or being denied any reason not to do so with people asking, “If Delhi can do it, why can’t you?”In an apparent gesture to people migrating to the city, he told those already here to call up their villages and say, “Hamara beta CM ban gaya dobara, chinta ki koi baat nahi hai” (Our son has become the CM again, there’s no need to worry). This was a direct call to AAP’s support base in slums and unauthorised colonies.He defended AAP’s freebies — free power, water, bus rides for women etc — with the remark: “Everything precious in the world created by God is free...Kejriwal loves people of Delhi and they love Kejriwal. This love is also priceless.” He added: “Do I start charging people for education and health? Do I start charging patients for their operations? That is not possible.”Kejriwal began his address with a full-throated cry of “Bharat mata ki jai, Inquilab zindabad and Vande mataram”. He was conciliatory in his demeanour, saying they had a lot of work to do in order to bring prosperity and happiness to people in the next five years and he would not discriminate between supporters of different parties. “I am everyone’s CM,” he declared.Kejriwal said the elections were over and he had forgiven the opposition for the remarks made against him during campaigning.I want to work together with all parties for development of Delhi. I want to work with the central government to take Delhi forward and make it a world-class city,” he said. In this regard, he sought the blessings of the PM and central government.The high-octane political canvassing ahead of the assembly polls had seen at least two senior BJP leaders, including a Union minister, calling Kejriwal a “terrorist”, forcing AAP run a counter campaign dubbing him the “son” of Delhi.But, in an oblique reference to the debate over nationalism, he linked the honour of the Tricolour fluttering in the wind to education, health, women’s safety, jobs, happiness for farmers and, finally, people rising above caste and religion to take India forward.Kejriwal ended his address with the Hindi version of “We shall overcome” i.e “Hum honge kamyab”, urging the crowd to sing with him. This was followed by a reiteration of “Bharat mata ki jai, inquilab zindabad, vande mataram”.The atmosphere at Ramlila Maidan — the epicentre of the India Against Corruption movement which witnessed the birth of AAP in November 2012 and where Kejriwal and his council of ministers were sworn in in 2013 and 2015 too – was charged up as the chief minister-designate and his six ministers took oath of office and secrecy.Vijender Gupta, who was leader of the opposition in the outgoing assembly, was the only person from the opposition to attend though many invitations had gone out.Along with Kejriwal, his team of six ministers repeated from the last term — Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gahlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Pal Gautam – also took oath of office. Deviating from the format of ministers taking the oath in the name of God, Rai and Gautam took the oath in the name of “martyrs of the freedom movement” and “Tathagata Buddha”, respectively.The swearing in ceremony — chief secretary Vijay Dev reading out the notification of the President of India appointing the chief minister and his council of ministers followed by the LG making them take the oath of office and secrecy — lasted barely 18 minutes.On either side of the dais were sitting ‘Dilli ke 50 Nirmata’ (50 creators of Delhi), selected by AAP from diverse backgrounds for their contribution to the “development” of the city. Drawn from diverse backgrounds — woman driver of metro, doctors at mohalla clinics, bus marshalls, farmers, anganwadi workers, autowallahs etc — some of them were profiled in TOI on Sunday. This underlined AAP’s theme that it was a people’s government.“Who are these creators (nirmatas)?” the CM posed to the crowd. “Delhi is not run by Kejriwal, politicians or parties. It is run by its teachers, doctors, autorickshaw drivers, rickshaw-pullers, students, bus drivers, conductors, vendors, businessmen and factory owners,” he explained, underlining the role of the aam aadmi.“I am happy that we have with us Vijay Kumar, who is studying at IIT. After passing out, he will serve the country. The future of the country depends on such youth,” said Kejriwal. “We have Dalbir Singh from Najafgarh. He is a retired teacher and earlier built the future of children. He is a farmer now and grows grains for you. We have Nidhi Gupta with us. You travel in the Metro to office and back, and she runs the Metro. She is a Metro pilot.”Arvind Kejriwal’s parents, wife Sunita, daughter Harshita and son Pulkit were present at the ceremony. Other family members of Kejriwal who attended the ceremony included Sunita Kejriwal’s sister and mother and the CM’s brother and aunt. AAP MLAs and MPs also turned up with their family members and were seated in the enclosure in front of the main dais.This will be Kejriwal’s third term as CM. Sheila Dikshit of Congress has had three complete tenures as Delhi CM between 1998 and 2013. Kejriwal’s first term in December 2013 was curtailed to 49 days when his minority government, propped up by Congress from outside, resigned on the issue of Jan Lokpal Bill.After a year of President’s Rule, AAP recorded a massive victory in February 2015, winning 67 seats in the 70-member House. Kejriwal retur ned to for m a gover nment in the national capital and completed his first full term in office. The party returned to office with yet another huge mandate winning 62 seats in the polls last week. The remaining eight seats went to BJP.In Video: ‘Will work for everyone, irrespective of caste, religion or social strata’: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal"

MUMBAI: BJP national president J P Nadda on Sunday dubbed the Maharashtra government led by Uddhav Thackeray as ""unnatural and unrealistic"", saying it has put brakes on the state's development.Addressing the state BJP convention at Nerul in the neighbouring Navi Mumbai township, Nadda said the party needs to be ready to go solo in future elections.He said despite the BJP getting mandate after the state Assembly polls in October last year, some with ""selfish motives"" parted ways with it and joined hands with those in the opposition to come to power.The BJP chief, however, expressed confidence that his party will win the next Maharashtra Assembly polls on its own.""The Maharashtra government is unnatural and unrealistic. Some people have parted ways with the BJP for their selfish gains,"" Nadda said without naming any party or individual.The BJP should be prepared to contest all the forthcoming elections on its own, he said.""You should be ready for 'all versus one (BJP)' kind of political battle in future,"" Nadda said addressing the party workers.The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the state after the Assembly polls in October last year. But, it failed to form government after the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena snapped ties with it over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.The Shiv Sena later forged an alliance with the ideologically different NCP and Congress to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state.Nadda said despite the state Assembly poll mandate being in favour of the BJP, ""selfish motives prevailed"" and some went to join hands with the opposition to form government.""The BJP is going to win the next Maharashtra Assembly election single-handedly. The state, under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis, was making progress but sadly, the development is now getting halted,"" he said.Nadda, who took over as BJP's national president last month, was speaking at the two-day state party convention which began in Navi Mumbai on Saturday.The BJP has decided to continue with Chandrakant Patil as its Maharashtra unit president."

JAIPUR: Urging the Centre to withdraw the contentious amended Citizenship Act to maintain peace and harmony in the country, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said that like many others he was not aware of the birthplace of his parents and could land in a detention centre.In a surprise move late in the evening, Gehlot reached Shahid Smarak— the city’s Shaheen Bagh where anti-CAA/NRC protesters have been staging round-the-clock dharna from February 1— and addressed the gathering.The chief minister claimed that information on birthplaces of parents was being sought for the National Population Register (NPR).“If I am not able to furnish the details, I too would be asked to live in a detention centre. But stay assured, if such situation comes then I would be the first to go there,” Gehlot told the protesters.He demanded the NDA government to “reconsider the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which is against the spirit of the Constitution, and come forward to withdraw it so that peace and harmony can be maintained”.He assured protesters that the Congress and the state government were with them and, if required, he would be the first to go to a detention centre.He said the BJP government in Assam has refused to implement the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ).“It is the right of a government to make a law, but a government should rule as per the sentiments of the people. Like Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, protests are being held at many places across the country, including Rajasthan . The government should understand public sentiments,” he said.Several states were against CAA and have passed resolutions in assemblies. ""We want the Centre to reconsider its decision,” he added.In Video: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot visits Jaipur's 'Shaheen Bagh', demands CAA rollback"

PUNE: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday said the ""sudden disappearance"" of the Congress was responsible for the BJP 's defeat in Delhi assembly polls as it led to a direct fight between his party and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).The Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP swept the Delhi assembly polls by winning 62 of the total 70 seats. While the BJP won eight seats, the Congress failed to open its account for the second consecutive election.""The (BJP's) defeat in Delhi elections was because of the sudden disappearance of the Congress. It is a different subject whether the Congress disappeared (on its own), people made it disappear or whether their votes got transferred (to AAP),"" Javadekar said at a press conference here.He said the Congress, which had got 26 per cent votes in Lok Sabha elections, could win only 4 per cent votes in Delhi elections.""Because of Congress's disappearance, there was a direct fight between the BJP and the AAP. We had expected 42 per cent votes for us and 48 per cent for AAP, but our prediction failed by 3 per cent each. We (BJP) got 39 per cent votes, while the AAP received 51 per cent votes,"" he said.The minister said that ups and downs were bound to happen in elections.""But the BJP does an analysis of all these things,"" he added.When asked about his remarks, in which he had described Kejriwal as a ""terrorist"", he said he had never made this kind of statement.Earlier this month, Javadekar had said that Kejriwal had called himself an ""anarchist"" and there is not much of a ""difference between an anarchist and a terrorist"".Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that hate speeches like 'goli maro' and 'Indo-Pak match' made by BJP leaders during the Delhi assembly election campaign may have resulted in the party's defeat.When asked about Shah's remarks, Javadekar said his observations are important.""But there are other reasons for the defeat and the review will be done,"" he said.""Ours is a party that keeps learning. We learn from our victories and defeats. So an analysis of the defeat will be done at the party level,"" Javadekar said.In Video: 'Disappearance' of Congress led to BJP's defeat in Delhi, says Prakash Javadekar"

NEW DELHI: Lok Janshakti Party, a key coalition partner in the ruling NDA disapproved ""hate speech"" by some of the BJP members during election campaign in Delhi. While observing that the hate speech may have spoilt the NDA's chances in the national capital, LJP chief Chirag Paswan said political parties should give ""priority to local issues"" in state polls.He told TOI, ""Hate speech should be avoided. These were not needed in Delhi polls. We should have focussed on what we delivered or would deliver rather than over emphasising on Shaheen Bagh and other negative issues. All involved in poll campaigns must follow decency. What we saw in Delhi was perhaps the worst in any election. State polls should be fought on local issues and the campaigning should not cause irreparable damage and foster personal enmity.""Chirag's views came as the NDA starts preparation for assembly polls in Bihar and West Bengal. He added that his party would not support any such effort, if it's repeated in Bihar election. BJP had given Seemapuri seat to LJP in the Delhi poll, which it failed to win. Chirag said the way they received support from people during campaign, it seemed NDA was going to make a major come back.“But when we held a review on Thursday with others, we understood that people voted for work,” he said."

Similarly, people's thought process is changing. We (Congress) have to change and reach out to people with a new approach,"" Scindia said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won the Delhi Assembly polls by bagging 62 of the total 70 seats.

PATNA: Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief Upendra Kushwaha on Thursday caused a flutter by proposing that veteran socialist leader Sharad Yadav be projected as the ""chehra"" (face) of the Grand Alliance in Bihar ahead of the assembly polls due later this year.The suggestion made by Kushwaha, seconded by another alliance partner Mukesh Sahni, who heads Vikassheel Insaan Party, was being seen as a snub to the RJD, which leads the five-party formation and had recently declared Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial candidate without taking allies into confidence.""Sharad Yadav is a highly respected leader. Grand Alliance has been plagued by a leadership crisis in the absence of Lalu (jailed RJD supremo). It would be beneficial for all if Sharad ji is projected as the face of the coalition"", Kushwaha a former Union minister, who joined the anti-NDA grouping before the Lok Sabha elections last year said.Sahni, a former Bollywood set designer, who is yet to make a mark electorally though perceived to be enjoying support of his sizeable Nishad community, echoed the sentiments expressed by Kushwaha.""Sharad ji will be an ideal choice. He is already a well-known face and we all can benefit from his experiences"", he said.Yadav, who formerly headed Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and has been in the political wilderness after having been forced to part ways, appeared to be enjoying the sudden limelight.""I am always happy to offer my services and carry out whatever responsibilities I am assigned"", said the former Madhepura MP, who has since floated his own outfit Loktantrik Janata Dal comprising, mostly, JD(U) rebels, but had to suffer the ignominy of unsuccessfully contesting the last Lok Sabha polls on an RJD ticket.RJD leaders were bemused by the development. While its national spokesman and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha asserted ""there is no alternative to Tejashwi"", the partys veteran national vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said leader of opposition is an obvious choice for chief minister.He qualified the statement with the observation ""Sharad Yadav is a national leader. He cannot be confined to a state-specific role"".The Congress, the second largest Grand Alliance constituent after RJD, asserted that any decision on leadership must be taken after consultations with all the coalition partners.""The question of leadership shall be decided jointly by all Grand Alliance constituents at an appropriate time. People are free to express individual opinions until then, though"", BPCC spokesman Rajesh Rathore said.The episode was yet another indication of the turmoil prevailing in the oppisition grouping which has been struggling to pick up its threads after suffering decimation in the general elections last year.Lack of trust in young Tejashwi Yadav's ability to steer the coalition has grown in the aftermath of the RJD drawing a blank in the Lok Sabha polls, which was the first occasion for the party to face an election without its charismatic founding president leading from the front.Founded by Lalu Prasad in 1997, the once mighty RJD is now a pale shadow of its earlier self and matters have been made worse by the infighting in his family which controls the party. His three children active in politics Tejashwi, Tej Pratap and Misa Bharti are not known to be on the best of terms.Yet another problem has been tantrums thrown by mercurial allies like former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi , who heads the Hindustani Awam Morcha and keeps issuing threats of exit from the Grand Alliance."

NEW DELHI: The Congress's humiliating defeat in the recently concluded Delhi assembly elections has led to calls within the party for a complete overhaul. Leaders like Jairam Ramesh , Verrappa Moily, Jyotiraditya Scindia feel the Congress needs to reinvent itself to face the new challenges.Voicing concern over the Congress debacle in Delhi and the crisis the party is facing in some states like Bihar and the Uttar Pradesh, senior leader Jairam Ramesh suggested that the party ""ruthlessly"" reinvent itself or face the prospect of becoming irrelevant.Citing the Delhi results and how the BJP utilised the Shaheen Bagh's anti-CAA protest to ""polarise"" votes, the senior Congress leader said, ""In the short run BJP has not won but the result is a disaster for the Congress party also.""""It is an unmitigated disaster like coronavirus for the Congress,"" the former Union minister said.Speaking on minority communalism, Jairam Ramesh said: ""We have to be very clear. We should not be pandering to any religious sentiment of anybody and that is real secularism.""""We have to be bold and aggressive against all forms of communalism. Unfortunately in the public, the propaganda is that the Congress is soft on minority communalism. It is a reality. We have to address this issue. We cannot live in a make-believe world. We should wake up,"" the Rajya Sabha MP, also a key Congress strategist, said.Congress general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia also said that the party needs to reinvent itself with new ideology, new thinking and new ways of functioning.""It is highly disappointing for our party. There is an urgent need for a new ideology & a new work process. Country has changed, so we also need to opt for a new way of thinking and connect with the people of the country,"" Scindia said when asked about the Delhi election results.On Wednesday, senior leader Veerappa Moily had called for a ""surgical"" action to revive the party in the context of the Delhi election drubbing.Earlier, Congress spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee also voiced her opinion publicly, saying ""enough of introspection"" and that it is ""time for action now"", blaming lack of strategy and unity at the state level.""We are again decimated in Delhi. Enough of introspection, time for action now. Inordinate delay in decision making at the top, lack of strategy and unity at state level, demotivated workers, no grassroots connect - all are factors. Being part of the system, I too take my share of responsibility,"" Mukherjee said in a tweet on Tuesday, when the results of the Delhi assembly polls were announced.Mukherjee, who is the daughter of former President Pranab Mukherjee, also hit out at former finance minister P Chidambaram after he, in a tweet, taunted the BJP over its defeat in Delhi, saying AAP won and the ""bluff and bluster"" lost.In her response, she said: ""With due respect sir, just want to know - has Congress outsourced the task of defeating BJP to state parties? If not, then why are we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned about our drubbing? And if 'yes', then we might as well close shop.""(With inputs from agencies)"

NEW DELHI: A day after the party's rout in Delhi elections , the knives are out in the Congress with leaders blaming each other and raising questions on whether the party has outsourced the task of defeating the BJP to others.AICC Delhi in-charge PC Chacko sought to put the blame of the party's decline on late chief minister Sheila Dikshit, saying the party started losing ground in 2013. Dikshit was chief minister of Delhi at the time.""The party's downfall started since 2013. The party lost in all subsequent elections thereafter and the new outfit AAP took away all the Congress votebank,"" he said without naming Dikshit.With party leader Milind Deora slamming him for his remarks, Chacko said he did not name Sheila Dikshit and his remarks were being wrongly interpreted to run a campaign against him.""I did not name Sheila ji, who did good governance and ensured all-round development of Delhi during the 15-year Congress rule,"" he said.The party's poor performance has triggered a blame game within the party, with Congress leader Sharmishtha Mukherjee taking on senior party leader P Chidambaram, who had welcomed the AAP win as ""defeat of bluff and bluster"".She asked the former minister if the state Congress units should shut shop in case the party had decided that others will take on the BJP across states.""With due respect sir, just want to know - has Congress outsourced the task of defeating BJP to state parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if 'yes', then we (PCCs) might as well close shop!“ asked Mukherjee.Sharmishtha is daughter of former President Pranab Mukherjee, who has been a Congress leader all his life.The Congress drew a blank for the second time in Delhi elections and its vote share plummeted to 4.26 per cent from 9.7 per cent in 2015.Deora slammed Chacko for his remarks saying, ""Sheila Dikshit ji was a remarkable politician and administrator. During her tenure as chief minister, Delhi was transformed and Congress was stronger than ever. Unfortunate to see her being blamed after her death. She dedicated her life to Congress and the people of Delhi.""Dikshit's former aide Pawan Khera said, ""Just a data point. In 2013, when we lost, Congress vote share in Delhi was 24.55 pc. Sheila ji was not involved in 2015, when the vote share slipped to 9.7 pc. In 2019, when she was back in charge, the vote share came up to 22.46 pc.""Congress leader Shashi Tharoor posted an Urdu couplet on Twitter saying, one is taking pride in someone else's victory, even in the party's defeat.""The Delhi results are disappointing for Congress but there are consolations: the BJP's divisive politics has been repudiated with their rout; AAP's development message is what has prevailed over identity politics; and 8 months after sweeping the LS polls the winners have been rebuked,"" Tharoor said in another tweet.Chidambaram, the former finance minister, had welcomed the AAP victory in Delhi polls, saying, ""AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP. I salute the people of Delhi who have set an example to other states that will hold their elections in 2021 and 2022."""

LUCKNOW: Ahead of her visit to the SP stronghold Azamgarh where she is likely to meet family members of arrested anti-CAA protestors, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said raising voice in a democracy is not a crime. Her visit also comes in the backdrop of ""missing"" posters of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav surfacing in his parliamentary constituency.The posters had questioned the MP's absence in the wake of police action on women protesting against the CAA here last week.In a tweet in Hindi, Priyanka Gandhi said, ""Raising voice in a democracy is not a crime. And, it is my duty to stand with those, with whom crime has been committed. (Loktantra mein awaaz uthaana julm nahi hai aur mera kartavya hai ki jinke saath julm ho raha hai main unke saath kharhi hoon).""Several Muslim women had staged a protest at Maulana Jauhar Park area here last week against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) but were forcibly removed by police.An FIR was registered against 35 named and over 100 unidentified people involved in the protests. Of them, 20 people were arrested, police had said.This is the Congress general secretary's second visit to eastern UP in less than a week.On Sunday, she had visited Varanasi on the occasion of Ravidas Jayanti."

NEW DELHI: The once formidable party that held sway in Delhi for three terms, Congress failed to win a single seat for a second consecutive assembly election with its vote share plummeting further to a little over 4% and 63 of its 66 candidates losing security deposits. The outcome starkly brought out a severe organisational crisis, a disconnect with grassroots and the absence of credible leadership at state and national levels.Congress finds itself in a situation where it is not a political presence of any consequence and is unlikely to recover any time soon. Among those who lost their deposits included heavyweights like former Delhi ministers Haroon Yusuf and A K Walia and former Rajya Sabha MP Parvez Hashmi, among others. The three who barely managed to save their deposits were Arvinder Singh Lovely (Gandhi Nagar), Devender Yadav (Badli) and Abhishek Dutt (Kasturba Nagar).This is the same party that swept 52 out of 70 seats in 1998 and Sheila Dikshit formed the government. Dikshit had a remarkable run of 15 years till being felled in 2013 in what was seen to be a clear vote for change with the advent of AAP on the political scene though BJP was the single largest party. Congress has failed to find its bearings since.The central leadership's failure to steer the ship stands firmly established with state in-charge P C Chacko failing to even make a start. Dikshit's demise, a poor campaign strategy and a dispiritedness, evident in the cursory engagement of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, left the party stranded. The minority vote swung to AAP as did other sections once loyal to Congress. In the Lok Sabha polls, it was seen as a likely contender, perhaps as part of a coalition, to fight BJP. Congress's tally of 52 settled that argument.With Congress president Sonia Gandhi unwell, the only rally she was to address at Seelampur did not happen. While AAP has spread a net of volunteers and workers, Congress has not even retained its worker base. Moreover, the block level leadership has been directionless with frequent change of state chiefs since the 2013 debacle. The post of Delhi Congress chief has been held by Arvinder Singh Lovely, Ajay Maken, Sheila Dikshit and Subhash Chopra since then.If the 2019 Lok Sabha elections were preceded by infighting with the anti-Dikshit lobby defying her, the late leader was herself reluctant to take on the role of PCC chief due to ill health. Under her, the party managed to better its vote share from a poor 9.7% in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls to 22.46% in Lok Sabha 2019. It came second and AAP third (18%) with BJP's vote at 56.58%. Far from learning from mistakes and building the organisation, infighting seized Delhi Congress."

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party’s successful poll campaign was notable for its clear and direct communication. They canvassed door-to-door to connect with every household and discussed the government’s performance with people in a series of town hall gatherings. While the party’s ‘guarantee card’ assured voters that welfare schemes for free electricity and water would continue, a catchy campaign song, and effective use of photos, videos and memes gave it an edge on social media.The party returned its pitch soon after its rout in last year’s Lok Sabha polls. ‘Dilli Mein To Kejriwal’ became its new slogan and CM Arvind Kejriwal said those who voted for the BJP in the LS polls would vote for AAP in Delhi. The government itself seemed to be in campaign mode since then, announcing freebies, such as 200 units of electricity, bus rides for women, free electricity for tenants and free sewer connections.The ‘Kejriwal Phir Se’ campaign launched in November recruited volunteers to take ‘Kejriwal Ka Report Card’ to 35 lakh households. It kept the focus on the government’s free schemes, besides its performance in the education and health sectors. Kejriwal himself answered people’s questions at more than 20 townhalls, showing himself to be a leader who doesn’t shy away from directly engaging with the public.When BJP tried to puncture AAP’s campaign by claiming the schemes for free electricity, water, public transport for women and pilgrimage for senior citizens were only for the current financial year, the government released a 10-point guarantee card—separate from the party manifesto that was released later—to quell people’s doubts about the schemes. Kejriwal, in fact, turned BJP’s silence on continuing his government’s free schemes to his advantage. He stressed in rallies that all the free schemes would stop if BJP came to office. The warning seems to have worked with the scheme beneficiaries.To project Kejriwal as the man who can take Delhi’s development to another level, the party hired Prashant Kishor, a professional strategist whose firm, I-PAC, had earlier helped Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar.Kishor went to work on ‘Brand Arvind Kejriwal’ with carefully planned slogans, impressive hoardings, large gates and social media campaigns. AAP’s publicity materials bore only Kejriwal’s photos to cement his image in voters’ minds. A picture of the CM holding an old woman’s hand was used extensively in hoardings to project him as a helping hand for Delhi.The slogans evolved as the poll campaign picked up tempo. ‘Dilli Bole Dil Se, Kejriwal Phir Se’ gave way to ‘Acche Beete Paanch Saal, Lage Raho Kejriwal’, followed by ‘Acche Honge Panch Saal, Lage Raho Kejriwal’. AAP’s campaign song ‘Lage Raho Kejriwal’ composed by Vishal Dadlani was also a hit on YouTube and in roadshows and public meetings.Political commentators say, by sticking to the development plank and playing up its success in education and healthcare, AAP cleverly avoided walking into the nationalism-Hindutva-Shaheen Bagh snare set by the BJP in the final weeks of the campaign. When BJP dubbed Kejriwal “terrorist”, AAP countered with “Delhi’s own son,” which had greater resonance among the masses."

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party bagging most of the Poorvanchali-dominated assembly constituencies has broken the myth about the migrants from eastern UP and Bihar voting en bloc for one particular party. BJP tried its level best to break into this numerically significant community by highlighting "" Poorvanchali asmita (pride)"", but managed to win only three seats.Most of these migrants, comprising around 40 lakh voters, live in the 1,700-odd unauthorised colonies in the capital. BJP had tried to woo them by offering ownership rights and regularisation of the colonies, but to no avail.Poorvanchalis play a key role in at least 27 assembly segments. The prime areas among the 24 seats that were won by AAP include Burari, Kirari, Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar and Uttam Nagar. The three BJP candidates who managed to withstand the ""Kejriwal storm"" are from Rohtas Nagar, Ghonda and Karawal Nagar.The fact that the victors got more than 50% vote share has proven that the Poorvanchali identity is no longer the only factor in play and these migrant communities are much more cosmopolitan than what they were credited for.Dinesh Mohaniya, who won from Sangam Vihar with 64.5% vote share, told TOI that BJP's rhetoric on Poorvanchalis failed and people from UP-Bihar voted for development, shunning regionalism.According to a Lokniti-CSDS 2015 survey, 55% of voters who were natives of Uttar Pradesh and 64% from Bihar and Jharkhand, the highest percentage among all communities, had voted for AAP in the 2015 polls.Ravi Ranjan, a political scientist from Zakir Hussain College, said, ""Compared with other groups, the community doesn't have a common identity marker based on caste, class or link with associations. There are many sub-divisions and their choices and interests are very different, which reflects in the voting pattern.""""Poorvanchalis certainly want identity affinity with candidates, but vote for parties that provide positive results in terms of education, housing, electricity and water, things migrants are deprived of,"" Ranjan said.While AAP fielded 12 Poorvanchali faces, BJP gave tickets to eight such candidates. Political analysts pointed out that the saffron party's decision to go for polls under the leadership of Bhojpuri star Manoj Tiwari rested on the fact that he was an influential Poorvanchali face. BJP also ceded its seats to JDU and invited Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to rally for it during the campaign. Congress allied with RJD and made Kirti Azad its campaign chief.AAP, however, reaped rich dividends by offering the community basic amenities like water and sewer network, free electricity and subsidies, apart from more Chhath ghats."

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Muslims have traditionally voted for Congress but shifted allegiance to the fledgling AAP in 2013. The support, which became more pronounced in 2015, appears to have become absolute now. On Tuesday, as results of the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections were announced, this was most glaringly evident at Okhla.AAP's Amanatullah Khan, who received more than 1.3 lakh votes, defeated BJP's Braham Singh by a margin of 71,827 votes, one of the biggest in this election. In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, Khan had defeated Singh by a margin of 64,532. While the margin by which Khan had won last time was also huge, the biggest difference has been in the fortunes of Congress.In 2015, Asif Mohd Khan of Congress had garnered 20,135 votes but this time three-time Congress MLA Parvez Hashmi got just 5,107 votes. In the Muslim-dominated Okhla constituency, Khan got 66% vote share, while the once popular Congress got just 2.5%!Okhla is important as Shaheen Bagh, epicentre of the protests against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, is part of the constituency. While AAP focused on the development plank, Shaheen Bagh was used as a polarising poll plank by BJP across the city. AAP didn't take a clear stand on the anti-CAA protests and kept a safe distance from Shaheen Bagh while Congress was vocal against CAA and NRC. In its manifesto, Congress had promised to pass a resolution in Delhi Assembly against CAA and ask the central government to withdraw it. It had also promised that if it came to power, it would not implement NRC and will not implement NPR in its current form. But the community didn't see it as capable of keeping BJP at bay.AAP performed very well in other Muslim-dominated constituencies of the city too. At Seelampur, which too has been witnessing anti-CAA protests, AAP's Abdul Rehman defeated BJP's Kaushal Kumar Mishra by 36,992 votes and Congress stalwart Chaudhary Mateen Ahmed came a close third. At Ballimaran, AAP's Imran Hussain won by a margin of 36,178 votes, while Congress bigwig Haroon Yusuf could garner only 4,797 votes. At Matial Mahal, AAP's Shoaib Iqbal won by a margin of 50,226 votes, while Congress candidate Mirza Javed Ali received only 3,403 votes.“It is wrong to think the minority votes in a bloc...However, the community is not economically well off. Kejriwal has helped them,” said Ravi Ranjan, assistant professor, Zakir Hussan Delhi College, Delhi University."

NEW DELHI: The Arvind Kejriwal who led AAP in the 2020 polls is quite unrecognisable from the one in 2015, who frequently lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and squabbled with the LG over files. Even before the LS polls, he warned parents that if they wanted their children to become chowkidars, they could vote for Modi.But since then, Kejriwal has done a course correction, refusing to pitch himself against Modi, instead implementing an agenda aimed at projecting himself as Delhi’s best bet. He didn’t contest Modi being the popular choice for the Centre, rather positioning himself as a leader with ideas and zeal when it comes to Delhi.The chief minister began paying more attention to governance, countering the perception that he is uncaring about development. In doing so, he reworked his image of being incessantly at war with the Centre, demanding more powers for Delhi government while not using the authority and the budget he had.The populist appeal of low power and water bills and free bus rides for women, along with steps to improve schools and access to health facilities blunted BJP’s charge of Kejriwal being an “anarchist”. It made him seem less a flash-in-the-pan phenomenon; his hybrid model of politics seemed more credible than a protester who became CM propelled by circumstance and fate.Kejriwal stayed on message right through – basically, around the “delivery” of services – and engaged with divisive issues like CAA and Shaheen Bagh only when he had to. He refused to endorse the protests directly, saying it was for the Centre to clear the blocked road in Kalindi Kunj. Instead, he set off on a temple run, recited the Hanuman Chalisa, and declared AAP as “hardcore nationalist”."

NEW DELHI: BJP’s sub-par performance in state elections post the Lok Sabha polls has served to underline the importance of state leaders in the contests, either by way of their absence or the burden of incumbency due to an unpopular chief minister.BJP has sought to bring national issues centrestage in assembly polls, arguing the Modi government has taken a number of decisive steps since its re-election such as abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and several measures to boost the economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah have emphasised the benefits of a “double engine” with BJP governments in the state and the Centre. The gambit has paid mixed results, indicating the Modi effect can help the party in a state poll, but this is not enough if there is no state mascot or one that has lost popular appeal.BJP’s wins in states like Jharkhand and Haryana, and its emergence as the single largest party in Maharashtra, after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections could be attributed to Modi’s rise on the national scene and expectations that the party would deliver at the state level. This gave BJP an opportunity to make unconventional choices for the CM’s post, even ignoring traditional caste considerations.Five years down the line, the performance of BJP governments is under scrutiny. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal was seen to have delivered on infrastructure and services, but faced a strong backlash from Jats upset over being dealt out of the power equation. In Maharashtra, the BJP-Sena alliance won, but with lesser than expected numbers. Nonetheless, a victory turned into defeat due to Sena’s desertion.While Maharashtra is an unusual aberration, Jharkhand saw BJP paying the price for failing to seal an alliance with its partner AJSU and former chief minister Raghubar Das’s image as a gruff individual. A record relatively free of scams did not help Das and BJP lost the election comprehensively to JMM and Congress.The challenge in Delhi was stiffer, given its urbanised character, television debates and widespread use of social media. Lack of a face to counter Arvind Kejriwal as CM hurt BJP and Modi’s promise of faster development and Shah’s roadshows and rallies attacking AAP for supporting Shaheen Bagh protests failed to stop AAP. Though the collapse of Congress was a major factor in AAP’s success, BJP fell short by a crucial 4-6% votes.Interestingly, BJP has not lacked state leaders. The triumvirate of Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Raman Singh and Vasundhara Raje has served BJP well. Chouhan and Singh scored repeat wins in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattishgarh. But the wages of incumbency and perceptions of a coterie calling the shots hurt them.BJP has a new crop of state leaders in Yogi Adityanath, Jai Ram Thakur in Himachal Pradesh, Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand, Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta Sarma in Assam, Biplab Deb in Tripura and Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra. There is also B S Yediyurappa, the old warhorse in Karnataka, and Vijay Rupani in Gujarat. But the party now needs new names elsewhere or could find itself struggling."

PATNA: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday side-stepped queries on the outcome of assembly polls in Delhi, where the coalition comprising his JD(U),BJP and LJP has been drubbed by the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, with the terse observation the will of the people is supreme.""Janata maalik hai"", uttered Kumar with hands folded above his head and the ghost of a smile playing on his lips as he sauntered past a posse of journalists tossing queries on the sidelines of a function where he unveiled a statue of Sangh ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.The JD(U), of which Kumar is the national president, had contested two assembly segments in Delhi Burari and Sangam VIhar and lost both to AAP by staggering margins.Although the JD(U) has never been a major player in the national capital, the current elections were significant because it was the first time that the BJP a formidable force in the city chose to take its smaller allies in Bihar along to take on the huge challenge posed by Arvind Kejriwals party, which is less than a decade old.The tie-up in Delhi had been frowned upon by JD(U) national general secretary Pavan Varma a socialite based in the national capital, who aired his differences in the open and faced the axe.Similar was the fate of Prashant Kishor whom the Chief Minister had made his partys national vice-president and whose position in the JD(U) had become increasingly untenable on account of his collaboration with Kejriwal in capacity of an election strategist.An indignant Kishor has threatened to visit Patna after the dust settles on Delhi and unveil his future strategy besides ""exposing"" Kumar.Kishor rendered his service to Kejriwal's party in drawing strategy for the Delhi election.Bihar unit of AAP has indicated that the state would be the next destination of the party.The partys state unit has said it would contest a large number of seats in the assembly elections later this year and seek to ""defeat polarization by focusing on issues like health and education"".The torpid opposition in Bihar, led by Lalu Prasads RJD with the Congress as a major ally, after its dismal performance in Lok Sabha polls is hoping for a burst of vigouramong supporters on account of the results in Delhi, which came barely a couple of months after the BJPs ouster in the adjoining Jharkhand.Tejashwi Yadav, the RJDs Chief Ministerial candidate hailed Kejriwal for defeating NDAs ""hate campaign"" and took a swipe at Kumar, saying ""yes, Janata is maalik. But he will have to face the maalik here when the assembly polls are held"".Yadavs exultation over the ""one-sided"" poll result, though, was ironic as the massive AAP wave smashed the NDA, besides pulverizing the Congress-RJD combine, which sank without a trace.However, interestingly, the development is likely to be received with a sense of relief by the JD(U) as well since the party will now be even more hopeful that Nitish Kumars detractors in the BJP will be kept on a tight leash.After the Lok Sabha polls last year when the BJP returned to power with a brute majority, several BJP leaders in the state had begun to make statements that the time had come for the saffron party to stake claim for the Chief Ministers post,thereby threatening to upend the alliance with the JD(U).A lid was, however, put on the controversy with repeated assertions by Amit Shah, then the BJP chief and still the de facto party strategist, that Kumar will lead the NDA charge in the assembly polls.Nonetheless, JD(U) sources say, a better than expected show in Delhi could have emboldened Nitish-baiters in the BJP and not augured well for the ties between the two parties re- stitched with tenuous threads in the wake of recent acrimony that lasted for a four-year period during which Kumar remained outside the NDA and vowed to make a Sangh-Mukt Bharat.The carefully worded statement issued by the BJPs Bihar unit spokesman Nikhil Anand, who offered his take the Delhi polls outcome, was a straw in the wind.""The election result of Delhi has reflected the local sentiment of the voters and it has nothing to do with Bihar politics.""BJP as well as our NDA allies, JDU a and LJP are busy strengthening the organisational structure at the root level in Bihar. NDA will sweep the 2020 assembly election in Bihar under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar"", he said."

NEW DELHI: A new kind of politics has emerged from the Delhi Assembly polls with people rewarding the party which built schools, hospitals and provided cheap electricity round-the-clock, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday, hailing AAP 's landslide win as a victory of India.""Delhiites, you have done an amazing thing (Dilli walo aapne ne gazab kar diya). I love you,"" Kejriwal said in a brief address to joyous supporters and party workers at the AAP's headquarters in the national capital.""It is a victory of all and every family who considered me their son and gave us a huge mandate. In the country today, Delhiites have given birth to a new kind of politics, which is called ""Kam ki rajniti"" (politics of works),"" Kejriwal, who won the New Delhi seat, said.The AAP is headed for a landslide victory on Tuesday in the high-stakes Delhi Assembly polls, leaving the main rival BJP way behind and decimating the Congress in a bitterly-fought contest.The people of Delhi have sent out a clear message that their vote is for those who build schools, hospitals, mohalla clinics and provide cheap electricity for round-the-clock, water to every household, and build roads, he said.""It is the beginning of new kind of politics today. This is very auspicious message for the country and the politics of work can only take our country to the 21st century,"" Kejriwal, flanked by his wife, daughter and senior party leaders, said from the stage erected at the party's headquarters.The AAP's stupendous victory comes nearly eight months after it suffered a severe drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls in which the party drew a blank while the BJP won all the seven seats.Among the AAP heavyweights who won the elections after a nail-bitter included Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Raghav Chaddha and Atishi. Delhi cabinet ministers Gopal Rai, Satyender Jain also were among prominent winners.The chief minister said lord Hanuman has blessed the national capital, adding ""Many many thanks to Hanuman ji.""""Lord Hanuman has blessed us, may god give us more strength to serve people of Delhi in the next five years as we did in the last five years. We will make Delhi a beautiful city,"" the AAP chief said.In the run-up to the assembly polls, Kejriwal had come under attack from BJP leaders for reciting Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channel.Responding to allegations, Kejriwal recently said that the saffron party has been mocking him ever since he recited Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channelKejriwal had also sought to know what kind of politics the BJP is doing.On Tuesday, the AAP headquarters were decorated with blue and white balloons and big banners with pictures of Kejriwal.Reacting to his party's defeat, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said people must have given the mandate after careful thinking.""Our vote percentage has increased from 32 per cent to around 38 per cent. We hope that there would be less blame game and more work,"" he told reporters.A total of 672 candidates, including 593 men and 79 women, were in the fray for the hotly contested elections.While Kejriwal was the star campaigner for the AAP, Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were among those who extensively campaigned for the BJP.The Congress got into campaign mode much later. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were among those who campaigned for the Congress.In Video: Want to thank people of Delhi for giving another mandate to their son: Arvind Kejriwal"

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal led the Aam Aadmi Party to a stupendous victory yet again in the Delhi Assembly polls, dealing a body blow to the main rival BJP and completely decimating the Congress in a keenly-watched battle in the midst of anti-CAA protests.This is the third consecutive win for the Aam Aadmi Party, which bagged 62 seats, losing only 5 from its 2015 tally of 67.The AAP 's stupendous victory comes nearly eight months after it suffered a severe drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls in which the party drew a blank while the BJP won all the seven seats.""It is a victory of the people of Delhi who considered me their son ... Lord Hanuman has blessed us. May god give us more strength to serve people of Delhi,"" Kejriwal said in a short victory speech. He said the ""politics of work"" has taken birth in Delhi and the AAP's victory is of the entire country.""The BJP, which had mounted a very aggressive and high-pitched campaign led by its top leadership, has bettered its performance over the 2015 assembly elections, but could only manage to be a distant second with 8 seats. Accepting defeat, BJP chief J P Nadda said ""party accepts mandate given by people of Delhi, will play role of constructive opposition. ""For the Congress, it was a huge disappointment yet again as it failed to open its account. In 2015 polls also, the Congress had drawn a blank. Party leader Sharmishta Mukherjee candidly summed up the defeat as she said ""we have been decimated again"".""People's mandate is against us, we accept it. We have resolved to revive and rebuild the party,"" Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference.The results have largely vindicated the exit polls, which had predicted a comfortable victory for the AAP.While the BJP did not win many seats, it managed to increase its vote share significantly by around 6 per cent to 38.5 per cent from 32.2 per cent in 2015. The BJP's gains came at the expense of the Congress, which has been the biggest loser in these elections. The vote share of Congress decreased by around 5 per cent from 9.7 per cent in 2015 to 4.25 per cent. The AAP marginally lost votes but managed to hold on to its 2015 share of around 54 per cent.For the AAP, the victory today was not without moments of scare as two of its top leaders Manish Sisodia and Atishi faced a tough fight before emerging victorious.Opposition leaders, from Mamata Banerjee to Chandrababu Naidu, were quick to congratulate Kejriwal for registering an impressive win against the BJP. Mamata, reacting to the verdict, warned the BJP of similar results in West Bengal assembly elections scheduled next year.Prashant Kishor, whose organisation I-PAC managed AAP's poll campaign, said the national capital has stood up to ""protect the soul of India"". ""Thank you Delhi for standing up to protect the soul of India!"" he tweeted as trends indicated huge win for AAP.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who had contested the Delhi elections in alliance with the BJP and who faces assembly elections in the state later this year, reacted to the results with a guarded response ""Janta malik hai"".The elections in the national capital took place in the midst of massive protests in the city and elsewhere over the new citizenship law, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.The BJP faced charges of carrying out a ""divisive"" campaign to polarise the voters by consistently highlighting the over 50-day demonstration by a group of women in Shaheen Bagh area. The AAP on the other hand focussed on its track record of governance.Both parties ran a high-pitched campaign with several public meetings and roadshows daily. Arvind Kejriwal shouldered the responsibility of AAP’s campaign with Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and Punjab MP Bhagwant Mann pitching in. Kejriwal held over a dozen townhalls, taking his government’s report card to the public.The BJP, which has not won in Delhi after 1993, showed its resolve to form a government this time with a high-decibel campaign which highlighted what it sees as a threat to national security.BJP invoked major decisions taken by its government — amending the citizenship law, abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A, and surgical strikes on Pakistan — to seek votes, besides highlighting what it claims to be AAP’s failure to ensure supply of clean water, installation of CCTV cameras and giving free Wi-Fi in Delhi.The Congress campaign lacked the incisiveness of the two rival parties. In the last week of electioneering top Congress functionaries — Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Manmohan Singh and chief ministers of four states, among others — made an appeal to voters to bring back the party that governed Delhi for 15 years and built “world class” infrastructure. The party openly extended its support to anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia with an eye on Muslim voters.In the 2015 assembly elections, Kejriwal's AAP got a record mandate winning 67 out of 70 seats. The BJP had won 3 seats while the Congress had failed to open its account. The AAP had polled over 54.3% votes in 2015 while the BJP got 32.2% and the Congress 9.7%.In Video: Want to thank people of Delhi for giving another mandate to their son: Arvind Kejriwal"

NEW DELHI: With its looming defeat in Delhi, the BJP-led NDA has now lost power in six states in the last two years. The BJP, which had won just three seats in Delhi last time, was expecting a much better performance this time.Delhi state BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had hoped to win 48 seats to enable the party to return to power in Delhi afer over two decades. However, these estimates proved to be incorrect.There are now anti-BJP governments in 12 states, including Delhi. The NDA now has governments in 16 states that account for 42% of the nation's population.The Congress is in power in Maharashtra , Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh , Punjab, and Puducherry either on its own or as part of an alliance. After forming the government in Jharkhand after the December election, the Congress has governments in seven states now.In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has won for the third time in a row. Trinamool Congress rules West Bengal, CPM-led coalition in Kerala, YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh, BJD in Odisha and TRS in Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, where the BJP fought the Lok Sabha election with the AIADMK, it does not have a single MLA. Therefore, it is not a partner in power.The NDA was in a much better position in December, 2017 when the BJP and its allies ruled 19 states. A year later, the BJP lost power to the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.In Andhra Pradesh, where the BJP-TDP alliance was in government, the TDP broke the alliance with the BJP in March 2018 while YSR Congress formed the government there in 2019 polls.In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena quit the NDA after the state election and formed the government with the Congress and NCP.Now Delhi has once again turned out to be a disappointment for the BJP."

PATNA: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday side-stepped queries on the outcome of assembly polls in Delhi, where the coalition comprising his JD(U), BJP and LJP has been drubbed by the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party , with a terse observation will of the people is supreme.""Janta malik hai,"" said Kumar with hands folded above his head and the ghost of a smile playing on his lips as he sauntered past a posse of journalists tossing queries on the sidelines of a function where he unveiled a statue of RSS ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay.The JD(U), of which Kumar is the national president, had contested two assembly segments in Delhi Burari and Sangam VIhar - and is trailing in both by huge margins.Although the JD(U) has never been a major player in the national capital, the current elections were significant because it was the first time that the BJP a formidable force in Delhi chose to take its smaller allies in Bihar along to take on the huge challenge posed by Arvind Kejriwal's party, which is less than a decade old.The tie-up in Delhi had been frowned upon by JD(U) national general secretary Pavan Varma a former diplomat, who aired his differences in the open and faced the axe.Similar was the fate of Prashant Kishor whom the chief minister had made his party's national vice-president and whose position in the JD(U) had become increasingly untenable on account of his collaboration with Kejriwal in the capacity of an election strategist.An indignant Kishor has threatened to visit Patna after the dust settles in Delhi and unveil his future strategy, besides ""exposing"" Kumar.The torpid opposition in Bihar, led by Lalu Prasad's RJD with the Congress as a major ally, is likely to experience a burst of vigour on account of the results in Delhi, despite their dismal performance, which came barely a couple of months after the BJP's ouster in the adjoining Jharkhand.However, the development is likely to be received with a sense of relief by the JD(U) as the party will now be even more hopeful that Nitish Kumar's detractors in the BJP will be kept on a tight leash.After the Lok Sabha polls last year, several BJP leaders in the state had begun to make statements that time had come for the saffron party to stake claim for the chief minister's post, thereby threatening to upend the alliance with the JD(U).A lid was, however, put on the controversy with repeated assertions by Amit Shah , the then BJP chief, that Kumar will lead the NDA charge in the assembly polls.Nonetheless, JD(U) sources say that a better than expected show in Delhi could have emboldened Nitish-baiters in the BJP and not augured well for the ties between the two parties, re-stitched with tenuous threads in the wake of the recent acrimony that lasted for a four-year period during which the chief minister remained outside the NDA and vowed to make a ""Sangh-mukt Bharat""."

NEW DELHI: ""Be strategic, don't get emotional"" was former Congress president Rahul Gandhi's advice to his party colleagues on Monday morning, when the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) met to deliberate over the party's floor strategy ahead of Monday's Parliament session.Gandhi's comments came in the backdrop of dramatic scenes in Lok Sabha on Friday when Congress and BJP MPs nearly came to blows over PM Modi's ""tubelight"" jibe in response to Rahul's ""danda"" comment. With a section of Congress MPs saying they would press for Gandhi's rights to raise question on the floor of the House, Rahul said they should focus, instead, on more pressing concerns, like the SC/ST reservation in promotion. He also said issues must be dealt with strategically and MPs should not be swayed by emotion while responding to BJP's ""barbs"".Following Rahul's morning briefing, Congress, announced on Monday that it would move a privilege motion against Union minister Thaawarchand Gehlot for ""misleading"" the House.On February 7, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had sought an apology from Gandhi for his ""danda"" remark against the PM when Gandhi had raised a question during Friday's Question Hour. In the ensuing dramatic scenes, Congress MP Manickam Tagore had aggressively rushed into the well of the House, only to be stopped by BJP's Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh."

MUMBAI: Extending his support to the Citizenship Amendment Act, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday warned of giving a ‘befitting eye-for-aneye reply’ to rallies being held against the new law. Along with Pakistani and Bangladeshi infiltrators, Thackeray added illegal Nigerians to his ‘hit list’. The MNS chief, however, opposed the proposed National Register of Citizens.On Sunday afternoon, the MNS workers—many in saffron t-shirts, waving the party flags and shouting slogans like ‘Bharatmata Ki Jai’, ‘Jai Shri Ram’, and ‘Vande Mataram’ —took out a huge march from Marine Drive near Hindu Gymkhana which culminated at Azad Maidan , where Thackeray demanded the eviction of illegal Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Nigerian infiltrators from the country. Before joining the march at Marine Drive, Thackeray sought blessings at Siddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi, while party leaders Amey Khopkar, Sandeep Deshpande, Santosh Dhuri performed an aarti at the nearby Ram Mandir.Deputy commissioner of police Pranay Ashok said around 20,000 activists participated in the march. He added that 3,000-4,000 police officials were deployed to control the crowd and CCTV and drone cameras were used to manage the crowd. According to political experts, the rally was a show of strength and to make people aware of the party’s new saffron flag bearing the royal seal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, that was launched on January 23.Addressing the rally, Thackeray said: “Bangladeshi and Pakistani infiltrators must be deported from India. Now, Nigerians have also been added to the list...Pakistani and Bangladeshi infiltrators’ pockets have been mushrooming everywhere.”In Video: Pro-NRC rally: Will drive 'infiltrators' out of India, says MNS chief"

SRINAGAR: Former J&K CM Omar Abdullah 's combination of ""radical methodology"" and ""capacity to influence people"", reflected in his ability to draw voters to polling booths in defiance of terrorist diktats, has been cited in the police dossier as the reason for his detention being extended by three months under the Public Safety Act (PSA).The dossier on Mehbooba Mufti , the third former CM to be detained under that law after Farooq Abdullah and Omar, labels her a ""daddy's girl"" who ""glorified terrorists after death"" and declared in a public rally that ""tampering with Article 35A would be akin to lighting a powder keg"".Omar and Mehbooba, who have been in detention since August 5 last year, were booked under the PSA last Thursday. Preventive detention can be extended beyond six months only if an advisory board, constituted two weeks before the completion of the 180-day period, recommends that.While Omar is being kept at Hari Niwas Palace, Mehbooba is in a Srinagar guesthouse.The PSA dossier on 49-year-old Omar, also a former Union minister, accuses him of ""instigating the general masses"" against the Centre. ""An overview of the activities of the subject suggests that the ideology of the subject is favouring radical thoughts, which he has also turned into action,"" it states.In labelling Omar a threat because of his ability to ""influence people for any cause"", the dossier falls back on an example of the National Conference vice-president helping the government rather than opposing it. ""The capacity of the subject...can be gauged from the fact that he was able to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycott,"" it says.The dossier also mentions Omar's social media presence, but does not cite any specific post or tweet. Before going offline on August 5, among the last tweets from Omar's handle was: ""To the people of Kashmir, we don’t know what is in store for us... stay safe and above all please stay calm.""In 60-year-old Mehbooba's case, the statements held against her include her public assertion that she would challenge J&K's accession to the Indian Union in the event of Article 370 being nullified. The dossier mentions how the former CM, whose party PDP was a BJP ally till June 2018, accused the Army of ""using chemical weapons"" against militants.It also cites her opposition to the ban on instant triple talaq and her remarks about lynchings across the country.Mehbooba's daughter Iltija Mufti, who has been tweeting from her mother's handle, on Sunday called the PSA ""draconian"" and questioned the charges in the police dossier. ""Believe it or not, but PSA dossier drafted on instructions of MHA on Ms Mufti, a former J&K CM, states the following — ""The subject is referred for her dangerous & insidious machinations & usurping profile & nature as 'Daddy's girl',"" she tweeted."

If Kejriwal wins, then it will be a victory of the developmental agendas,"" Chowdhury told ANI.The Congress leader added that if BJP loses the Delhi Assembly elections , the communal agenda will also end with the party's defeat.""BJP brought all its leaders here and kept shouting ' Shaheen Bagh ' and on the other hand, Arvind Kejriwal kept saying--Mohalla Clinic and spoke about other works as well. Congress tried to convey a message that long-term development was witnessed during the term of former Delhi CM Shiela Dixit,"" he added.Further speaking to ANI about BJP chief Manoj Tiwari 's statement exuding confidence over his party's victory in the Delhi Assembly polls, Chowdhury said that daydreaming is his fundamental right but BJP won't win the Assembly polls.""We know that he sings and dances really well but elections are something way more different than that. He can daydream...that's his fundamental right but it will still be a dream. BJP won't win in Delhi Assembly polls,"" Chowdhury told ANI.As Delhi elections concluded on Saturday evening, the exit polls predicted that AAP will win a two-thirds majority with some giving it a three-fourth majority in the 70-member assembly. They predicted that Congress will continue its dismal show in the national capital.The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll predicted 47 seats for AAP and 23 for BJP.The ABP News-C Voter poll predicted that AAP will get 49-63 seats and the BJP 5-19 seats. According to the poll, the Congress could win 0-4 seats.The TV9 Bharatvarsh-Cicero exit poll predicted that AAP would win 54 seats, BJP 15 seats and Congress one seat.The Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat exit poll gave 48-61 seats to AAP, 9-21 seats to BJP and 0-1 seat for the Congress.The AAP had registered a landslide victory in 2015 elections getting 67 of 70 seats. The BJP had won three seats while Congress had failed to open its account."

I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'. This will make my back even stronger to face abuses.

NEW DELHI: Amid anti-CAA protests in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday accused the Congress and the Left of inciting people at protest sites.Replying to a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's Address in Lok Sabha, Modi also attacked the Congress for its politics in the last seven decades, saying the party's politics of last 70 years has been such that no Congress leader can be self-sufficient.Slamming former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah for their remarks on abrogation of Article 370 , Modi said Kashmir's identity was buried on January 19, 1990, when Kashmiri Pandits started leaving the Valley due to militancy.""Who made Kashmir only about land grabbing? Who made Kashmir's identity only about bombs and guns? Can anyone forget that dark night of January? In reality, Kashmiri identity is closely linked with harmony,"" he said.Elaborating on his government's achievements, the Prime Minister said the people of the country have seen his government's work between 2014 and 2019 and gave a bigger mandate in 2019.""The people of India saw our work for five years. They once again blessed us, so that we work even faster,"" he said.Modi said India can no longer wait for problems to remain unsolved, and, rightfully so. ""That is why, our aim is speed and scale, determination and decisiveness, sensitivity and solutions"".""The people of India have not only changed the Sarkar (government). They want the 'Sarokar' (conduct) to be changed as well. If we had worked according to the old ways and thought processes: Article 370 would never have been history. Muslim women would have kept suffering due to Triple Talaq,"" he said.The prime minister said if his government worked as per the old ways, the Ram Janmabhoomi issue would have remained unsolved, Kartarpur Sahib corridor would not be a reality, there would be no India-Bangladesh land agreement.Modi said the Congress did not remember to save the Constitution during Emergency and the 'Save Constitution' mantra is must ""for those who dismissed several state governments"".Without naming Rahul Gandhi, Modi said, ""I heard an Opposition MP saying- we will beat Modi with sticks in 6 months. I have also decided I will do more 'Surya Namaskar'. This will make my back even stronger to face abuses. In any case, I have been abused so much for the last 2 decades that their negativity hardly matters"".On the economy, the prime minister said the government has kept the fiscal deficit in check, price rise is also under check and there is macro-economic stability.Modi said the agriculture budget, which was earlier Rs 27,000 crore, has now been increased by five times to about Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The agriculture budget has risen 5 times during the tenure of the NDA Government.The prime minister said driven by politics, some states are not allowing farmers to benefit from the PM-Kisan Scheme.""I appeal to them- let there be no politics in farmer welfare. We all have to work together for the prosperity of farmers of India,"" he said.He said the PM-KISAN Samman Yojana is transforming the lives of many farmers. Several farmers have benefited due to this. In this scheme there are no middlemen and no extra file work.Modi said the FDI in April-Sept 2018 stood at $22 billion, while in April-Sept 2019 it increased to $26 billion. This reflects confidence of foreign investors in India, he said.Referring to the Northeast, Modi said for years, distance became a reason to ignore this region. Things have changed now and the region is becoming a growth engine as great work has been done in so many sectors and ministers and officials are regularly visiting the Northeast.""Despite many efforts, the issue was unsolved for years. Whatever was done earlier was for meeting political ends, remained confined to papers.""The Bodo Accord signed now is special because it has brought all stakeholders together and we are moving towards a more peaceful era,"" he said.At the beginning of his speech, some Congress MPs raised slogans hailing Mahatma Gandhi with party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury saying, ""it is just a trailer"".At this Modi shot back: ""Mahatma Gandhi may be trailer for you, but he is life for us""."

NEW DELHI: Congress Tuesday demanded that BJP expel its MPs Anant Kumar Hegde and Pragya Thakur to prove its “much professed and publicised love for Mahatma Gandhi”.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the BJP leadership was paying lip service to Gandhi while its members were repeatedly insulting the Father of the Nation. He termed as sham the BJP’s demand for an apology from its MP Hegde, recalling that another MP Pragya Thakur recently called Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse “a patriot”.“It is a sham to maintain the fig leaf that now barely covers the naked hatred and contempt that BJP and RSS have towards the Mahatma, as indeed generations of freedom fighters who gave away their life in the cause of an Independent Mother India,” he said."

NEW DELHI: With Delhi assembly elections just days away, the controversial remarks by BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma during the poll campaign and the ongoing anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh here figured prominently in Lok Sabha on Monday.The lower house witnessed protests by opposition members, mostly from the Congress and the DMK, against the amended Citizenship Act, with Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury saying the government cannot silence people's ""boli"" (voice) with ""goli"" (bullet).Speaker Om Birla and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi asked protesting members, who had trooped into the Well as soon as the Question Hour began at 11 am, to raise their issues during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address.With opposition members carrying placards and raising slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Speaker adjourned the House after a little over 10 minutes following the Question Hour. He emphasised that it was for lunch.People are protesting to protect the Constitution and are carrying national flags, Chowdhury said, alleging that some protesters were killed ""mercilessly"".""You are fake Hindus,"" he said, attacking the BJP, and added that if its members were ""asli (genuine) Hindus"", then they would have behaved differently.Thakur, who is the Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs, had made some controversial remarks during a recent poll rally in the national capital.He was banned from campaigning by the Election Commission for three days for egging on people to raise the slogan ""shoot the traitors"", after he lashed out at anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protesters.Belligerent Congress members, who were in the Well, shouted slogans against the minister and asked ""Aapka goli kaha hai? (where is your bullet?)"".Some members also shouted ""Goli maarna band karo (Stop shooting)"".Whenever Thakur was responding to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the members began sloganeering against him.Opposition members, including those from the Congress and the DMK, also walked out of Lok Sabha to protest the controversial remarks by BJP member Parvesh Verma during a poll rally, when he rose to initiate a debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address .As soon as Verma rose to initiate the debate, opposition members raised slogans against him like ""sharm karo (have shame)"".Speaker Om Birla said what a member says outside cannot be raised inside the House and that members should not set a ""wrong precedent"".Verma was barred by the Election Commission last week for four days for his controversial remarks made during an interview and at an election meeting.Verma took on the Congress for its opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying, ""They should know that it is not Rajiv Feroze Khan government, it is Narendra Modi's government.""We will not take back CAA. It is a question of the country's integrity.""He referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, rather people there are saying ""Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.""Verma said India is proud to have such a President who has rejected the mercy plea of Nirbhaya convicts.Congress' Gaurav Gogoi demanded that Thakur be booked under relevant laws.He alleged that political masters at the top are giving directions to ministers to make inflammatory speeches.""Book the minister"" under relevant laws, he said without taking any name.""In front of Delhi Police, a boy fired on the people,"" the Congress leader said adding ""he must have been motivated by someone"".""I want to know who is pulling the trigger. It's not the minister or that boy,"" he added.P K Kunhalikuty (IUML) said that in the Delhi election rallies while the AAP and the Congress are talking about development, the BJP is trying to make it as ""communal as possible"".""They are even giving a call to shoot people. People sitting in high offices are making these calls,"" he alleged, adding they are targeting a minority community in the country.He said that no senior BJP leader is condemning such remarks.""The prime minister talks about new India but it is full of hatred, anarchy and joblessness,"" he alleged.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to reply to the debate on Wednesday."

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on the Congress in Lok Sabha, the BJP on Monday accused the opposition party of indulging in vote bank politics and creating problems like Article 370 during its rule.BJP member Parvesh Verma , who initiated the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address, also took on the Congress for its opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying, ""They should know that it is not Rajiv Feroze Khan government, it is Narendra Modi 's government.""We will not take back CAA . It is a question of the country's integrity.""He said that ""they (Congress) create problems like Article 370 and 35(A)"" by their ""vote bank politics"", and ""we solve them"" to strengthen India.Verma said Lord Rama gives the message of humanity but the Congress linked him with religion, and went on to add that ""if opposition members chant 'Jai Shri Ram', their sins will be washed off"".The BJP MP said his government was not of any particular religion.Verma also accused the Congress of removing the pictures of Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Hanuman from the original copy of the Constitution and added that these pictures were ""not related to religion"".He said that if his government talks about Ram Mandir, it also talks about toilets.Stressing that a strong foundation would be laid by the present government during its tenure, Verma said that in three years India will become an economic power, while the Opposition Congress will shrink.The Constitution, he said, was of foremost importance and asked the Congress ""where was the Constitution when riots took place in 1984.""Padma awards were given during the Congress rule ""on recommendation. In contrast, they are given on merit under the BJP government,"" Verma said.The West Delhi MP also attacked the Congress over the policies followed by it when the party was in power in Delhi.He said that while it was the Congress government which created problems like unauthorised colonies, the BJP government has worked to solve them.Verma also said that if the BJP comes to power in Delhi, it will ensure that 'pucca' houses will be built in unauthorised colonies.He also targeted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), saying it had said that the number of buses will increase, but in reality the number of DTC buses has gone down in Delhi.He also said that Delhi has been alloted the maximum share from Nirbhaya fund but the money remains unutilised.""Delhi Government is giving Rs 18,000 salary to Imam... but has forgotten the priests of temples and gurudwaras,"" he said.Verma also referred to the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, saying it is not a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, rather people there are saying ""Pakistan zindabad, and Assam and Kashmir should be separated from India.""The BJP leader also hit out at those who questioned surgical strike by India on terror camps in Pakistan.Earlier, opposition members, including those from the Congress and DMK, walked out of Lok Sabha to protest Verma's controversial remarks during a poll rally, when the BJP MP rose to initiate the debate.The TMC said that Verma's speech was for Delhi election campaign and not for debate on the President's address. Delhi goes to polls on February 8."

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday said it was disappointed with the Centre for ignoring its repeated requests and yet again allocating just Rs 325 crore as Delhi’s share in central taxes . This amount has been stagnant since FY 2001-02.AAP claimed that the Centre had showed its apathy in the Budget by reducing the overall allocation for education and giving a green signal to foreign direct investment (FDI) in schools. Delhi chief minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal said that he had expected a larger allocation for the capital, considering that assembly elections are less than a week away.Taking a dig at BJP, which released its election manifesto on Friday, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi: “Delhi had high expectations from the Budget. But once again it has been given stepmotherly treatment by the Centre. If Delhi is not BJP’s priority, why should people vote for the party? If BJP is disappointing Delhi before the elections, will it keep promises after the elections?”Talking to reporters, deputy CM and finance minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the Budget lacked vision, was “disappointing” in the critical education sector and had “deceived” Delhiites.Disappointed with the Centre reducing the allocation for the education sector from 3.6% to 3.2%, Sisodia said, “I had expected an increase in the education budget in line with the National Education Policy, which says 6% of the GDP should be spent on this sector. The decrease clearly shows the apathy of BJP towards education.”“Allowing FDI in education is a dangerous step. BJP wants to make education a profit-making business. It also shows that BJP is only interested in giving education to a certain class of people,” Sisodia said.Sisodia said all states get a 42% share from their contribution to central taxes, but Delhi had been getting a miniscule Rs 325 crore for almost two decades. “Delhi pays about Rs 1.5 lakh crore as taxes. We had asked the Centre to enhance the share to Rs 7,000 crore to finance development projects. The Delhi budget has increased from Rs 8,739 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 60,000 crore in 2019-20. However, the share in central taxes has remained frozen at Rs 325 crore,” he added.The deputy chief minister said that despite governing the three municipal corporations, BJP didn’t earmark any funds for them. Delhi government had asked for allocation of at least Rs 1,250 crore in the 2020-21 budget estimates. “Delhi government gives 12.5% of its annual net tax collection to the local bodies, but they are not getting any financial support from the Centre,” added Sisodia.“BJP had in the 2017 municipal corporation polls declared that the local bodies would get funds directly from the Centre. What happened to their promise? Was it another jumla?” Sisodia asked.Claiming that the new income tax slabs for the salaried class were complicated, Sisodia said people won’t be able to save anything from their hard-earned money."

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday demanded a nationwide farm loan waiver even as it accused the Modi government of “hatching a conspiracy” to end the minimum support price system, a move it alleged would leave farmers at the mercy of the open market.In continuation of its pre-budget press conference series to “expose” the Modi government on the downward slide of the economy, Congress quoted a Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) report, to allege that the government was considering stopping the purchase of crops from farmers.“Until now, the BJP government has cheated and exploited the farmers in the Budget. We hope that in this year’s budget, the finance minister will clarify to the people of the country what it has done to double farmers’ income by 2022, the status of finances of the Food Corporation of India as well as of the Agriculture Market Infrastructure Fund,” said Prithviraj Chavan , former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan, adding that the CACP report recommended a reduction in the purchase of wheat and paddy from farmers.Congress alleged that in 2018-19, the Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund received an endowment of Rs 2,000 crore but spent only 0.5% of the amount. The proposal was to set-up 22,000 markets but only 376 were set up, Chavan said, adding that while the government had claimed it would double farmers' incomes by 2022, it is not considering stopping MSP and subsidy money to the Food Corporation of India, which had debts exceeding Rs 2.65 lakh crore.Congress also demanded that the government bring agriculture produce, implements as well as processed farm goods under the minimum GST rate to protect an already stressed farm sector.On Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also slammed the Modi government for “turning around” the Indian economy, literally. In a Twitter post, Rahul took a jibe at the Modi government and said the while inflation levels has climbed to where the GDP rates were, the GDP had plunged to historic lows. “Modi & his dream team of economic advisers have literally turned the economy around. Earlier: GDP: 7.5% Inflation: 3.5% Now: GDP: 3.5% Inflation: 7.5% The PM & FM have absolutely no idea what to do next,” Rahul said on Twitter."

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday accused PM Narendra Modi of violating the poll code through his speech at the annual NCC rally and urged the Election Commission to take note of it. Congress functionary Prithviraj Chavan said it does not behove the PM to make such remarks to impressionable minds. “Election (campaign) is going on in Delhi and the PM is making a political speech at the NCC rally.I request the EC to take it up seriously. Just because he is the PM, he cannot violate the EC rule,” Chavan said. Addressing the Annual PM’s NCC Rally 2020 on January 28, Modi had said his government had brought the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to correct “historical” injustices and recalled the Nehru-Liaquat pact to assert that the law fulfils India’s “old promise” to religious minorities in neighbouring countries. Modi also said the J&K problem had persisted since Independence with some families and political parties keeping issues in the region alive. This had resulted in terrorism thriving, he had said."

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after writing to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan that he would not read the paragraph mentioning the passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in his budget session address to the state assembly, governor Arif Mohammed Khan acceded to the CM’s request on Wednesday.Amid a high-voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF, Khan presented his policy address and read out the references to the anti-CAA resolution, despite his “deep reservations”.Pinarayi had written to him on Wednesday morning requesting him to maintain constitutional propriety.“I have been corresponding with the CM on the matter for the last few days. I disagree with the government view but I will read to honour his request,” the governor said in his speech, in a surprising turn of events which continued to mark the ‘dramatic’ day.The controversial paragraph said: “Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution. This august body unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Centre to abrogate CAA , 2019, which my government believes goes against cardinal principles underlying our Constitution. Pursuant to this, my government has filed an original suit before the honourable Supreme Court invoking provisions of Article 131.”Governor Khan, accompanied by the CM, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for few minutes inside the well of the House as opposition members blocked the passage. As soon as the governor entered the House, the opposition MLAs shouted “Governor go back!” and blocked the passage and prevented him from entering the dais of the speaker. Even though the speaker requested the MLAs to go back to their seats and allow Khan to deliver his address, the opposition members were unrelenting.Khan then called the watch and wards of the House and asked them to remove the protesting MLAs.Opposition member Ramesh Chennithala told reporters that the state government and the governor had come to a “truce”. “The CM’s double stand has been exposed now. The CM begged the governor to read the policy address. This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” he alleged.The Supreme Court has been hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala high court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three hydroelectric projects in 1997.In his letter to the governor on Wednesday, the CM, said sources, quoted Article 176 which describes the duty of the governor to the assembly. “I request you to read out the speech approved by the council of ministers in its entirety without addition or deletion.”"

AGRA: Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha, who was stopped by the Aligarh administration from going to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to address students, on Wednesday, blamed the Centre for the anti-CAA protests and violence which has erupted in parts of the country, especially in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh (UP). He also claimed that the BJP will lose the February 8 Delhi elections.The language being used by the BJP leaders in their campaign for Delhi elections is proof of their impending defeat, Sinha claimed while speaking to the media. “People use derogatory language when they feel frustrated,” he said, adding that the party wants to fight Delhi’s election with a communal agenda.Some BJP leaders have been pulled up by the election commission for making objectionable remarks during their campaign for party candidates in Delhi. Sinha added that such kind of communal atmosphere was not present during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s rule. “Vajpayee ji never tried to divide the communities,” Sinha said.Sinha, who stated that the local administration did not allow him to visit the AMU, also made an appeal to anti-CAA protesters to express dissent in a peaceful way, and not give the government any opportunity to inflict violence. “The Centre was responsible for the violence in UP and Delhi varsities,” he said, adding that there is nationwide “unrest” due to the enactment of CAA and talk about implementation of NRC across the country.“People are mistaken if they think they can rule the country on the basis of lies and violence,” he said, stating that “Nathuram Godse’s ideology will never be accepted by this nation”.On the upcoming Budget, the former finance minister said, “All expectations are dead now. The economy is passing through its worst-ever crisis and its revival looks very unlikely. Demonetisation was absolutely wrong and the way the government implemented GST was wrong too. These two steps are mainly responsible for the current state of the economy.”On Wednesday, Sinha was in Aligarh during a stopover of his march from Mumbai to Delhi’s Rajghat for propagating Mahatma Gandhi’s ideology. He said the 21-day-long journey will conclude in Delhi on Thursday, and the message is to persuade the government to withdraw CAA and not implement NRC."

JAIPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Modi of destroying India’s image and scaring away investors, and urged the youth to not let their voice be suppressed.Addressing the ‘Yuva Aakrosh’ rally in Jaipur, Rahul, however, refrained from speaking directly against CAA , but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate jobs for the youth. Coming down heavily on the Modi government’s promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year, he claimed that 1-crore people had lost their jobs the past year alone. “Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,” he asked.“Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on unemployment,” he said. “The growth rate during UPA’s tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP (gross domestic product). If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5%,” he added.Urging the youth not to let their voices be suppressed, the former Congress chief encouraged them to ask questions on employment and the country’s future. Rahul said India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan . But the image is now tarnished and businessmen are wary of investing, he claimed.“PM Modi has destroyed India’s reputation in the world. Today, India is known as the rape capital, but Modi does not talk about this,” he said.. When the youth raise questions over unemployment and ask Modi why he “destroyed” India’s image, they “are answered with bullets and are suppressed”, Rahul remarked.The growth rate during UPA’s tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP."

PATNA: Soon after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reminded JD(U) functionary Prashant Kishor once again that he was inducted into the party on the advice of Union home minister Amit Shah , PK shot back, saying “what a fall for you to lie about how and why you made me join JD(U)”, taking the showdown between the two to the next level.“Amit Shah ji told me to take him in the party. But he (PK) works for different kinds of people as a (poll) strategist. He is now working for AAP. He might have ambitions to go places. He is free to go,” Nitish said.Soon after this, PK put out a tweet: “@NitishKumar, what a fall for you to lie about how and why you made me join JDU!! Poor attempt on your part to try and make my colour same as yours! And if you are telling the truth who would believe that you still have courage not to listen to someone recommended by @AmitShah? (sic).”Nitish not just reminded PK of Shah’s recommendation, but also said: “I don’t have any problem if he (PK) wants to leave the party. It’s okay if he stays, and if he doesn’t, it’s fine. But if he wants to stay, then he will have to follow the basic structure of the party.”He added, “Someone (referring to another party member Pawan Varma ) wrote a letter and I responded to it. Someone (PK) is tweeting, let him tweet. What can I do about it? People can stay in the party till the time they want. They are free to go whenever they feel like.”Earlier also, on many occasions, Nitish had said, JD(U) admitted PK in its fold in September, 2018, on the “advice of Amit Shah”. He had even accused PK of not losing any opportunity to attack the Centre’s policies, including CAA, NPR and NRC.While PK is upset about JD(U)’s stand on CAA-NPR-NRC, Varma is not happy with the party extending its alliance with BJP to the Delhi assembly elections."

On January 25, Rajasthan became the third state in the country to pass a resolution in its assembly against the implementation of the contentious

Hours after the historic special session of the assembly, Rajasthan chief minister

spoke to

Swati Mathur

about why the CAA-NRC-NPR combine is dangerous, how focus must shift to the state of economy and creating jobs, and the reason he believes Rahul Gandhi can lead the Congress in raising issues that matter:

Congress seems to be shifting focus from CAA-NRC-NPR to the issues of economy and unemployment. Why?

What is today’s Yuva Aakrosh Rally seeking to achieve?

Congress leaders have said states are bound by the Constitution to implement laws passed by Parliament. In this light, since Rajasthan is now the third state to pass a

and NRC, and the first to formally announce its non-cooperation towards NPR, how will you do this?

Protests over CAA-NRC-NPR have taken a violent turn in several states. Rajasthan saw protests too but they were peaceful. What did you do to achieve that?

There are talks of differences in the government — between you and deputy CM Sachin Pilot. Is this true?

Congress’s stand on CAA is the same that it was earlier. BJP said it will approach three crore people through door-to-door campaigns to explain the CAA. Why has the need arisen? Until today, no laws made by Parliament needed to be explained. It proves there is a major flaw in the law and now that people have seen through it, they are worried and are having to explain.The real issues — the ones that matter to the people — are related to economy. If the government does not take immediate remedial action, the downward spiral can trigger a massive crisis. Joblessness is on the rise. Youth is frustrated and is getting pushed to the brink.Industry is stressed and small and medium trades are shutting shop. Where will the jobs come from? For an economy to grow, there needs to be investment in public and private sectors, there should be purchasing power in the hands of the common people and exports should rise. This, not CAA, should be the government’s top priority. Instead, since BJP came to power in 2014, they have taken decisions to hurt the economy. Auto sector is closing showrooms, petrol, diesel prices are not reducing, prices are rising and farmers, labourers and youth are all frustrated. The GST regime even cost Rajasthan a revenue loss of over Rs 11,000 crore.After winning in 2019, the BJP has returned with inflated egos. It doesn’t care about public sentiment. The government abrogated Article 370 and settled the Ram Mandir issue . People welcomed that because it brought closure to a long-standing dispute. But they are continuing to rake up one thing after another to fulfil their Hindu Rashtra agenda. It is a dangerous game. I even wonder whether all of BJP stands with them (PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah) on this. Because they don’t involve people in making decisions.It is a campaign Rahul Gandhi is starting from Rajasthan, where we will tell the youth that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder. In democracy, it is very important to hear the Opposition’s view. It gives confidence to people. The youth has little faith left in the government of the day. If they feel that the opposition is also not standing with them, they will feel even more frustrated. In public interest, and to tell the youth that we stand with them to pressurise the government into listening to the voice of the people, Rahul ji will lead this rally. We will force the government to listen and to concede.heeded the call of the Congress Working Committee — the highest decision making body of the party — and the sentiments of its members to lead us strongly on various issues. He is an assertive leader and does issue-based politics. He is not waylaid by the government’s efforts to sentimentalise issues. I am glad he chose Rajasthan to start this campaign from.If there is a democratically elected NDA government at the Centre, there are elected governments in states too. A majority of states are saying CAANRC should not be implemented because it is impractical. Take Assam for instance. People went into depression, some committed suicide, many spent hard earned money to bribe officials so their names would be included in NRC. Despite this, they are facing disenfranchisement. The entire exercise cost Rs 1,600 crore and now (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah says it will be implemented across the country. According to estimates, a nationwide NRC will cost Rs 64,000 crore. Can the country afford this? What will happen if it is conducted? Results will be the same as they were in Assam. Of the 19 lakh people left out in Assam, 16 lakh turned out to be Hindus. Yet, they (BJP) created such a ruckus. To prevent a recurrence of Assam, all states have given a call to the Centre not to implement the law. Public doesn’t want it and the majority of elected state government don’t want it. They (NDA government) should accept the public sentiment and withdraw the law. Such a decision will be welcomed by the people.CAA, NRC and NPR must not be seen in isolation but as a package. The entire exercise is not practical. If people decide not to show their papers, how many will the government act against? Assam was a small state and they could extract information through fear and force. But can this be done across India? The problem began after the government said it wanted to conduct a nationwide NRC. Now they are on the defensive and have swung into damage-control mode. The PM said that no Hindu or Muslim will face problems. He even said there is no discussion on NRC in the government, and accused the Opposition of inciting people. On the other hand, Shah said it will be done. Between the PM and the HM, who should the public believe? Both have spoken publicly. The PM should explain this. Ultimately, they should remove confusion, win people’s trust and then decide the course of action. If their decision is in public interest, everyone in the country will support them.That depends on the call you give to people. Our call to the public in Rajasthan was for a Peace March. We asked for two things; that the Indian Flag must not be allowed to be defaced and that there should be no violence. Lakhs of people participated and held placards as a mark of protest.If Yogi Adityanath had given the same call for a Peace March in UP, told people there should be no violence and had engaged with them and assured them it was their right to stage sit-ins and protest and that the police would facilitate their peaceful protests, there would be no problem. Instead, he used the language of “badla (revenge)” and told protestors they will be taught a lesson. He ended up inciting people further. In democracy, it depends on the chief ministers and the prime minister as to what call they give to their people. The administrative machinery and the police speaks the language that the CM speaks. The administration understands the intent of the political leadership and acts accordingly. That is what happened in UP.Opposition parties have come together to protest against CAA-NRCNPR. BSP, though, has kept away from Congress-led protests ostensibly because Mayawati is upset over her MLAs being poached in Rajasthan. Your comments.I have not poached MLAs. Their entire party merged with the Congress. The Constitution makes it legal for three-fourth or more of a party’s members to merge with another party. Under that law, they merged with Congress. What can I do? This has happened earlier too. She may have other reasons that she is not voicing. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is active on the ground in UP. That may be upsetting Mayawati ji.The media plays this up. I don’t pay attention to it. I don’t pay attention to these “differences”. We were together just yesterday. We meet and talk affectionately and we do our work. Differences exist when both sides create an issue or initiate a confrontation. I don’t create issues. So where is the fight? It takes two to fight."

MUMBAI: Ashok Chavan , former Maharashtra chief minister and at present the public works minister, has said that Congress will walk out of the newly-minted Maha Vikas Aghadi government if the Constitution and Common Minimum Programme (CMP) are violated.He made these remarks at a Congress workers’ rally on Sunday as part of Republic Day celebrations. “I made it clear to our workers and prominent citizens who were present that the new government will adhere to the Constitution and CMP. If there is any deviation, Congress will withdraw,” Chavan told TOI.The comments come days after CM Uddhav Thackeray re-emphasised the Shiv Sena’s “saffron colour” and Sena mouthpiece Saamna wrote that “illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims should be thrown out”. Chavan added that when the Agahdi was being formed, Congress members had had a meeting with party president Sonia Gandhi. “Sonia Gandhi agreed to join the Shiv Sena-led government only on the condition that all constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi would adhere to the Constitution and CMP. We had then assured her that if there is deviation, Congress will pull out of the government,”he said."

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went on the offensive on the Shaheen Bagh issue on Monday, accusing BJP of deliberately not getting the road opened. Addressing a press conference, the chief minister said: “BJP does not want to get the road — closed due to the protest — opened. Holding press conferences will not lead to improvement in law and order in Delhi. Law and order can improve with efforts. We can teach you how to work. We know how to work and they only know how to hold press conferences and do dirty politics.”Kejriwal seemed to have overcome his initial hesitation in discussion the issue, faced with BJP’s aggressive campaigning. He said the road, affected by the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, will be opened on February 9, a day after polling is held for the assembly elections. The closure is causing huge inconvenience to commuters.It was last week after deputy CM Manish Sisodia said on a TV channel that he stands with the Shaheen Bagh protesters that BJP began attacking him and Kejriwal. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra called AAP an anti-Hindu party while Hari Nagar candidate Tajinder Singh Bagga said BJP stands with India and AAP with Shaheen Bagh protesters.Union home minister Amit Shah escalated the attack on Monday by daring Kejriwal to clear his stand on the Shaheen Bagh protests and explain whether he was in favour of the protesters.Later, on Twitter, Kejriwal responded to Shah who had also sought his stand on JNU student Sharjeel Imam, who has been booked for his speeches. “Sharjeel talked about cutting off Assam from the country. This is serious. You are the home minister of the country. Your statement is low level of politics. It is your responsibility to get him arrested. Two days have passed since he made the remarks. Why are you not arresting him? What is your helplessness? Or do you have to do more dirtier politics?” Kejriwal asked on Twitter.“I am disappointed with the dirty politics of BJP on the issue,” he said at the press conference. “The road is closed and it is causing inconvenience to a large number of people. School children and ambulances are facing obstruction. Travelling (through Kalindi Kunj ) that usually took 30-40 minutes is taking two-and-a-half to three hours. “I can give it in writing that...the road will open on February 9.”The chief minister said he had repeatedly observed that Constitution guarantees the right to protest to every citizen but it should not result in inconvenience to the common man. “Why is the BJP led central government, which is responsible for law and order, not solving this problem,” asked Kejriwal. He said that instead of holding a press conference, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad should have visited Shaheen Bagh and talked to the protesters to get the road opened. He urged Shah and other BJP leaders to also visit Shaheen Bagh and do the job."

MYSURU: Away from the glitter of Republic Day celebrations, chaos reigned in the BJP as ministers came under pressure to step down to accommodate defectors who won on BJP tickets and party loyalists who are waiting in the wings.During an event at Suttur Mutt on Sunday, chief minister BS Yediyurappa refused to answer questions on the issue, tersely saying: “I will not respond to questions on cabinet expansion.” However, at the event, Yediyurappa welcomed Chikkaballapura legislator D Sudhakar as a “future minister”, indicating at least one of the 11 turncoats who won is certain of a place in his cabinet.Earlier, Sudhakar had dismissed the possibility of defeated candidates being made ministers, citing the Supreme Court verdict upholding their disqualification. “The Supreme Court gave clear directives while dealing with our petition and it has to be factored in,” he told reporters.However, AH Vishwanath, one of the disqualified MLAs who lost and who is reportedly pushing for a cabinet berth, found support in Chamarajanagar BJP MP V Srinivas Prasad, who said all 17 rebel MLAs should find a place in the council of ministers. “I stand by what I had said earlier,” he said.Meanwhile, BJP legislator and former Union minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal said in Vijayapura that all those who enjoyed privileges of power earlier should now make a “sacrifice” for the sake of the party. Yatnal appeared to be targeting former CM, opposition leader and present industries minister Jagadish Shettar and former DyCM and legislative council opposition leader KS Eshwarappa, who is now the RDPR minister.“Despite serving as a senior minister in the [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee government, I’ve given up ministerial aspirations,” Yatnal said. “I expect all those who previously enjoyed power including those who served as CM, DyCM and opposition leader to sacrifice their posts now. Sacrifice is not only for cadres but also for leaders who make speeches about it.”In Tumakuru, law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said he was prepared to resign if the party instructs him to do so. “I will happily vacate my cabinet berth to ensure a stable government,” he said, adding sarcastically that he will even resign from his MLA seat if asked.But health minister B Sriramulu, in Chitradurga, sang a different tune saying all those commenting on resigning from posts were talking in their “personal capacity”. He evaded questions on resigning and instead suggested he continues to nurture hope of being elevated to DyCM. “Yes, people are demanding it [that he be made DyCM]. However, it is up to the central leadership and I will abide by whatever decision they take,” Sriramulu said.Reports suggest Yediyurappa has sent a tentative list of about seven names from the disqualified lot, who won on party tickets, and another set of BJP loyalists to central leadership for approval."

NAGPUR: In a swipe at Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said on Saturday that the government's ""remote control"" was with the NCP and its ""batteries"" were with the Congress Speaking at a gathering of BJP workers, the former chief minister attacked the Shiv Sena, the BJP's former ally, for abandoning its ideology and joining hands with the Congress and the NCP to form government.""Nobody can understand who is running this government.

They say they have not changed their colours, but we can see their changed colours,"" Fadnavis said, in an apparent reference to Uddhav Thackeray's statement that he had not changed his ""saffron colour"".If the Shiv Sena was still committed to Hindutva , why does it not support the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and ""show its strength"" when Vinayak Damodkar Savarkar is insulted (by its ally Congress), Fadnavis asked."

BHOPAL/ GWALIOR: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday claimed his party would return to power in the state after the upcoming Jaura assembly bypoll.The Jaura bypoll has been necessitated due to the death of its Congress MLA Banwari Lal Sharma on December 21.No date has been declared for the bypoll though rules specify that it must be held within six months of the seat becoming vacant.""Looking at the outcry among the people, the BJP will return to power in the state, not just win Jaura (in Morena district ),"" he told reporters.""No one should act with the arrogance of power. There are some rights of the opposition in a democracy. It is the Congress' mistake to adopt a mentality of crushing the opposition. This mentality would lead to its debacle,"" Chouhan claimed.Earlier, Chouhan paid tribute to Vijayaraje Scindia , one of the founders of the BJP, on her death anniversary.The Congress, however, hit back and said Chouhan was ""day-dreaming"".""Ever since the Congress came to power in MP, it is the regular claim of the BJP that it would come back to power. The people of the country are ensuring the BJP's defeat as we can see from results of recent assembly polls in several states. Chouhan should stop day-dreaming,"" said MP Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi.In the 230-member MP assembly, the Congress has 114 seats, while the BJP has 108.The Kamal Nath government in the state is supported by four independents, two BSP MLAs and one Samajwadi Party legislator."

NEW DELHI: BJP national president JP Nadda on Friday slammed the AAP, alleging the Arvind Kejriwal-led government failed to construct more schools and hospitals and install CCTV cameras in Delhi as it had promised.Nadda, who was on January 20 elevated from 'working president' of the BJP to its national president, was addressing a Nukkad Sabha in Pandav Nagar in the Lakshmi Nagar constituency.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of not fulfilling its promises of adding more schools, hospitals, installing free WiFi and appointing anti-corruption ombudsman (Lokpal) in the capital.""The AAP had promised adding 500 more schools, 30 new hospitals, 5,000 buses, lakhs of CCTV cameras, promised free WiFi at public places, Lokpal. But did they do it? They have not and that is their past,"" Nadda said, cautioning voters to beware of the AAP's poll promises.He cited infrastructure works undertaken by the BJP government at the Centre like the Eastern and the Western Peripheral Expressways, Meerut Expressway that he said have helped Delhi and nearby areas.Nadda, 59, also mentioned major decisions taken by the Narendra Modi government after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, like abrogation of Article 370 and 35 in Jammu and Kashmir, banning triple talaq and bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act, seeking to highlight the political will power of the BJP.""For most of the last five years, you kept saying that Modi ji is not letting you work and now you are claiming 'Achche beete paanch saal' (five years were well spent). It doesn't add up well what you say. Your lies are easy to catch. They say something and do something else, while the BJP does what it says,"" Nadda told a gathering, comprising mostly local party workers and supporters.""There are several issues. We have to bring Delhi to mainstream and ensure its progress. It's our national capital and a reflection of whole country,"" he added.Nadda also hit out at the rival Congress for its stand on the Ayodhya land dispute and alleged that the national party and the AAP were misleading people on the citizenship law.He said that Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru also wanted persecuted minorities to get a chance to settle in India and Manmohan Singh had also shared a similar view during his tenure as Prime Minister for persecuted minorities in Bangladesh.""Only the people sitting in this bagh (garden) or that bagh (referring to CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh in South East Delhi) and supported by the Congress are opposing the CAA. The Congress and the AAP are spreading lies and misleading people on the citizenship law,"" he claimed.The Lakshmi Nagar constituency in East Delhi will see a contest between sitting MLA Nitin Tyagi of the AAP, Abhay Kumar Verma of the BJP and Hari Dutt Sharma of the Congress, among others.Elections to the 70-member legislative assembly of Delhi are scheduled for February 8 and its result three days later.In the last elections, the AAP had won 67 seats, while the BJP emerged winner on three seats.Abhay Verma, the BJP's nominee from Lakshmi Nagar, said the MLA should be a local and not an outsider.""Tyagi is from Mayur Vihar ,"" he said.If somebody gets five years chance, he should come with a report of his work when he asks for a re-election, alleging the AAP has not worked in Lakshmi Nagar.""He comes at 10 and sits in the Jal Board office, leaves at 5. Doesn't work,"" Verma claimed."

NAGPUR: A court in Nagpur on Friday granted exemption from appearance to BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis in connection with a complaint seeking criminal proceedings against him for alleged non-disclosure of criminal cases in his election affidavit.During the last hearing on January 4, the court had directed the former Maharashtra chief minister to appear before it on January 24.However, Fadnavis's advocate on Friday sought exemption from appearance saying a review petition has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging an earlier order of the apex court directing for trial to be held against Fadnavis in the case.The complaint was filed by advocate Satish Uke, in which he claimed that Fadnavis had not diclosed the details of two criminal cases pending against him in the affidavit he had filed along with his nomination papers during the assembly elections held in 2014.Fadnavis's lawyer Uday Dable told the court on Friday that they would seek a stay on the trial court proceedings before the Supreme Court and hence sought exemption from appearance for Fadnavis pending hearing and disposal of the review petition on SC.Uke's advocate Sudeep Jaisawal then filed an application seeking non-bailable warrant to be issued against Fadnavis for failing to appear before the court despite being summoned twice.Chief metropolitan magistrate RM Satav accepted the request for exemption, but said Fadnavis will have to appear before it on February 10 if the apex court does not pass an order granting stay on the proceedings.""The issuance of non-bailable warrant is kept in abeyance. If on the next date the accused (Fadnavis) fails to produce before us effective order of the Supreme Court, then he (Fadnavis) should remain present,"" the court said.It added that the court would be sending a wrong message to the society at large if exemptions are granted to Fadnavis repeatedly.After the SC directed in October last year for trial to be conducted against Fadnavis, an order of issuance of process (notice) to Fadnavis was passed on November 4, 2019.He was then directed to appear before the court on January 4.On that day, Fadnavis's lawyer sought exemption on personal ground and said that the BJP leader was occupied with campaigning and monitoring of the Zilla Parishad elections in Maharashtra.He was then granted exemption and directed to appear on January 24."

MUMBAI: The NCP on Friday accused the central government of withdrawing its chief Sharad Pawar 's security at his official residence in New Delhi and charged it with playing ""vendetta politics"".Maharashtra minister and NCP's chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said party leaders cannot be scared off with such a move.The party's fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah will continue, he asserted.Malik said Pawar, a Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister, had 'Y' category security cover in the national capital.The security personnel deployed at Pawar's residence at 6 Janpath in the national capital stopped reporting at the bungalow since January 20 and there was no prior intimation from the government about it, he added.""This is a kind of vendetta politics. They think NCP leaders will be deterred by this. It is their misconception. ""The fight against Modi and Shah will continue,"" the Minority Affairs Minister said.His party and ministerial colleague Jayant Patil also slammed the BJP and linked the alleged move of the Centre to the saffron outfit losing power in Maharashtra.""From by-lanes to Delhi, the BJP has taken it to heart the change of power in Maharashtra. Therefore, the BJP is behaving with vengeance.""This is detrimental to the democracy!"" tweeted Patil, the state NCP president who is also the water resources minister.The 79-year-old NCP president enjoys 'Z+' category protection in Maharashtra, where his party is a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government.Pawar had played the lead role in crafting the three- party ruling coalition in Maharashtra in November last year. The Congress is the third constituent of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi."

LUCKNOW: A day after Union home minister Amit Shah threw a challenge to the opposition, Bahujan Samajwadi Party supremo Mayawati on Wednesday said her party is ready for a debate on the CAA on any platform.Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) here on Tuesday, Amit Shah had dared, besides Mayawati, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav to a debate with him on the law on a 'sarvjanik manch' (public platform).""The BSP is ready to accept the challenge thrown by the central government, which is troubled by the organised struggle and agitation all over the country against the most controversial CAA/NRC/NPR, especially by the youth and women, for a debate on the issue on any platform and anywhere,"" Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.It does not include Muslims.Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is intended to target the Muslim community in India.However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone's citizenship."

LUCKNOW: Attacking the opposition for ""misleading"" people on the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the law will not be scrappedover it.Addressing a rally here in support of the CAA , Shah also declared that""touching the skies"" in Ayodhya will begin within three months.The minister accused the Congress of not implanting the suggestions that came from its own leaders in the past on granting citizenship to minority Hindus in Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and Afghanistan after Partition.He also targeted West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee , saying she is now opposing Indian citizenship for Dalit Bengalis.At the same meeting, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that the Congress is shelling out money for “arson” and protests over the CAA.Amit Shah said there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone's citizenship away. “A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, SP, BSP, and Trinamool Congress.”The CAA is a law to grant citizenship, he added.“I want to say that irrespective of the protests it will not be withdrawn,"" he added.Shah challenged opposition leaders to hold a discussion with him on the CAA at a public forum.He named Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav , Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee while throwing the challenge.""If any clause of the CAA takes away the citizenship of anyone, including Muslims, they can tell me. The agitations and sit-ins, which are being organised in the country against it, are wrong,"" he said.""The Congress has become blind due to vote bank politics,"" he said, and also blamed the party for Partition.""Rahul baba open your ears and listen carefully. Because of the sins of your party in 1947, the country's partition on religious basis was accepted.” Mentioning figures, he said the proportion of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in Pakistan and Bangladesh dropped drastically after Partition.""Where have they gone? They were either killed, converted or came to India as refugees. These blind people cannot see that atrocities were committed on crores of people,"" he said.Shah asked opposition parties where they were when “crores of people were killed” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on the basis of religion.He said five lakh Pandits were displaced from Kashmir, “but these parties did not utter a word”.“Now, because of PM Modi, a new chapter has begun in the lives of these people,"" he said.Shah referred to the recent Supreme Court verdict that allows the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site. The crowd cheered when he said the construction will begin in three months.Accusing the opposition of speaking the language of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, the BJP leader said, ""I don't know what relation they have with Khan.""Shah claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Indira Gandhi advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan but their Congress party never implemented the suggestion.On Mamata Banerjee, he charged, ""She was demanding citizenship for Dalit Bengalis. Now when the citizenship is being given to them, she has problems.""Shah claimed that during the Rajasthan assembly elections, the Congress had advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan.The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who entered India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution. Muslim migrants don't figure on this list.In Video: Will not withdraw Citizenship Act, says Amit Shah at pro-CAA rally"

NEW DELHI: The three municipal corporations will be making lodging arrangements for over 13,000 employees deployed on election duty at 13,463 polling booths the night before voting takes place.The initiative has been taken on the direction of Election Commission making it mandatory for male staff deployed on election duty to stay on site at night before election day so that mock polling can be conducted before 7am. It’s optional for women staff to stay overnight at the polling booths.A senior East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said there will be 3,131 polling booths at 566 sites in areas under its jurisdiction.“Each site has 3-10 polling booths. At each booth, there will be one polling team, including 2-3 polling officers, one presiding officer and an assistant. They will have to be on duty by 5am on election day so that EVMs can be checked and mock polls conducted in front of the polling agents. This is the reason why their lodging arrangements have been done on site,” the official said.A nodal officer and sanitation and health department employees of the municipal corporations will be stationed at the sites, including primary, Delhi government and private schools and community halls.The civic agencies have been asked to install porta cabins instead of tents this time. “We have called for a joint meeting with officials of all zones on Tuesday to identify sites that have a shortage of rooms,” said a North Delhi Municipal Corporation official."

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday ducked queries about a viable seat-sharing formula for the ruling NDA in Bihar for the assembly elections later this year though he asserted that his outfit would act as a ""cementing force"" for its senior allies JD(U) and BJP Paswan, a member of the Union cabinet, also sought to distance himself from recent comments by his younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras who had suggested that JD(U) headed by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and the BJP fight 100 seats each leaving the remaining 43 for the LJP.""Paras is a senior leader of the party. He may have spoken something after being pestered with questions by the media. But a seat-sharing arrangement is not made before the media. Of course, once a formula is agreed upon the same will be made public at an appropriate time"", Paswan told reporters.When probed further on whether the party would insist on a figure that came close to the one his brother favoured, Paswan said ""I think the number that Paras spoke about was indicative.The party has six members in the Lok Sabha. One constituency normally comprises six to seven assembly segments. So the number of assembly seats that come under the parliamentary constituencies held by us come close to the 43, he said.He, however, hastened to add ""I would reiterate that I saw Paras speak on TV and whatever he uttered was in response to questions from journalists. This is not the time to speak about seat-sharing. Top leaders will take a decision at an appropriate time. I disapprove the practice of issuing statements before the media in this regard"".Paswan was also asked questions about the tug of war that has been going on between the JD(U) and BJP despite repeated assurances by Union Home Minister and ex-BJP chief Amit Shah that elections in the state will be held ""under the leadership of Nitish Kumar"".""The LJP has always acted as a cementing force between its two allies and I assure you we will play the same role in Bihar assembly polls . We will ensure that NDA puts up a united fight and we return with a three-fourth majority', the 73- year-old leader said with an air of ebullience.Recently, the pot was stirred by JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor, who held that his party must contest a number of seats that was higher than, and not equal to those fought by the BJP unlike in the Lok Sabha polls last year wherein both parties fielded candidates in 17 constituencies each.The BJP gave up five of its sitting seats to accommodate the JD(U) which had returned to NDA in 2017 - and while it won all the 17 the ally bagged all but one.LJP, too, came up with a cent per cent strike rate winning all the six seats it had contested. Paswan, this time, left his pocket borough of Hajipur for Paras and got elected to the Rajya Sabha from the seat vacated by cabinet colleague and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad, who now represents Patna Sahib.The LJP founder, however, parried questions about assembly polls in Delhi where his party has been contesting with marginal success and where the BJP is said to be wary of going it alone and planning to take alliance partners like JD(U) and Shiromani Akali Dal along.""Chirag is now the partys national president. He will take a call based on the situation that the party is presented with', Paswan quipped.Controlled by Paswans family,LJP underwent the proverbial generational shift recently when the Union ministers son who is the MP from Jamui was made the national president while Prince Raj, who debuted from Samastipur in a by-poll necessitated by his father Ram Chandra Paswans death took over as state president replacing Paras."

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan has sought a report from the state government for moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act without informing him. The chief secretary has been asked to submit a detailed reply “immediately”.“Article 166 (3) of the Indian Constitution specifies that the chief minister and his government has to inform the governor about the government business,” Khan told reporters later. The state government had on January 13 moved the top court challenging the act and had sought to declare it as unconstitutional.“It is not a personal fight between me and the government. I am not important. But what’s important is the Constitution and the law of the land… In many of its decisions, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the constitutional powers given to the governor are mandatory,” he said.Khan said he could not remain a mute spectator.“I will act to protect the Constitution. I will see to it that the rule of business is followed. What the government has done is in contravention of the act,” he said. When it was brought to his notice that law minister A K Balan has said the government has not acted against the law, he said, “I am quoting the act. Let him quote the act and clarify.”"

In the land of the Mahatma, violence is on the throne today. Its victims, among others, are helpless passengers in trains, loyal workers in strike-bound factories, and innocent citizens on riotstricken roads when the bandh-mongers claim the freedom of the city.”This is not a view on the present atmosphere in the country riddled with anti-CAA protests. This was said by Nani A Palkhivala, the unparalleled legal luminary, way back in 1982 referring to the situation prevailing in India then. But these words are apt for today’s India, embittered by violence and political games. Palkhivala’s description of the 1980s India continues to hold even now. “Not since abolition of thuggery by Lord William Bentick in the 1830s has violence characterised our national life on a scale so widespread and so unchecked as today. Our legal system has made life too easy for criminals and too difficult for law-abiding citizens. A touch here and a push there, and India may become ungovernable under the present constitutional set-up,” he had said.Right to protest is undeniably a fundamental right. But this right does not extend to destruction of public property, or to laying siege to roads to violate right to free access of people and rendering India ungovernable. This right does not extend to incite communal feelings. Sadly, these are methods often adopted by protesters and their sympathisers. Worse, even state governments have lent support to such activities.The Kerala government has filed a suit under Article 131 making the Citizenship Amendment Act a Centre-state dispute. Punjab intends to follow suit. Is this in consonance with the federal structure envisaged by our Constitution?Law teachers often said ‘India is a federal republic with a unitary bias’. In state of Rajasthan vs Union of India [1977 AIR 1361], a seven judge SC bench explained, “A conspectus of provisions of our Constitution will indicate that, whatever appearances of a federal structure our Constitution may have, its operations are certainly judged both by the contents of power which a number of its provisions carry with them and the use that has been made of them, more unitary than federal.”Constitution’s principal architect BR Ambedkar, considered India to be “both unitary as well as federal according to the requirements of time and circumstances”. Over the years, the SC has settled the law and most political parties will agree with Palkhivala, who had said, “We do need a strong Union. But a strong Union is in no way inconsistent with strong states. On the contrary, by definition, a strong Union can only be a Union of strong states.”The Left parties and Congress traditionally have had seasoned legal brains. When not in office, these two parties sink their differences and sniff for brewing troubles. Then they do their best to fan it. Remember the unprecedented press conference of ‘senior’ Supreme Court judges led by Justice Jasti Chelameswar in 2018?Left leaders took full advantage of the chinks in the judiciary. They roped in willing legal brains of Congress to peddle canards in active connivance with activist lawyers and intellectuals. Together, they left no stone unturned to ridicule the judiciary, chisel down its stature and make every judge an object of suspicion.The protests against CAA, as long as there is absence of a design to destabilise India through perpetration of violence, must get due space. But what we are witnessing is worrisome as violence has invariably accompanied protests.When India was on the path of industrialisation under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , the then Union government through Parliament enacted a law in 1957 to acquire privately held coalfields, most of which were in West Bengal, to increase coal production. The Bengal government, claiming sovereign control over its land and minerals, moved the apex court with an Article 131 suit challenging the law.The Bengal government argued, “States have within their allotted field full attributes of sovereignty and exercise of authority by Union agencies, legislative or executive, which trenches upon that sovereignty is void.” Rejecting the state’s suit against the Centre [1963 AIR 1241], the SC had said, “The executive power of every state has to be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that state, and not to impede or prejudice the executive power of the Union.”In 2004, when Congress-led UPA was in office at the Centre, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had filed a suit under Article 131 in the SC challenging the validity of Parliament-enacted MP Reorganisation Act on the issue of division of electricity board assets and dues after carving out of Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh.Disapproving a state government challenging the validity of a Parliament-enacted law through Article 131, the SC in ‘State of MP vs Union Of India’ on August 17, 2011, had said, “Normally, for questions relating to validity of central or other laws, the appropriate forum is the extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India in a writ petition and not an original suit filed under Article 131 which vests exclusive jurisdiction of this court as regards disputes enumerated therein.”The Supreme Court will again decide whether suits under Article 131 filed by Kerala challenging CAA, and Chhattisgarh challenging the National Investigation Agency Act, are maintainable in our federal structure of governance."

NEW DELHI: Differences between Maharashtra allies Congress and Shiv Sena have sharpened over the past few weeks with a constant exchange of barbs between Sena MP Sanjay Raut and senior Congress functionaries over conferring the Bharat Ratna on right-wing ideologue Vinayak Savarkar, popularly known as 'Veer' Savarkar.In the latest exchange of barbs, while Congress repeated its criticism of Savarkar and argued against Bharat Ratna being conferred on him, Raut went to the extent of demanding that those opposing Savarkar should be sent to the same jail where he was lodged for 14 years.This is the second time in less than a week that Raut has stoked a controversy with his comments. Earlier, he had referred to former PM Indira Gandhi meeting yesteryear underworld don Karim Lala , a comment that triggered a sharp reaction from the Congress camp, and leading to a phone call from Congress's Maharashtra in-charge Mallikarjun Kharge , asking for Sena to stick to the common minimum programme for governance.""Such statements are not good for the alliance. We should not speak the language of dividing each other. We have a common minimum programme of governance. We should talk about the CMP instead of past things. If we talk about past, so many things will come out,"" Kharge had said.Even though a section of Congress and Sena brass have laboured the point that the verbal crossfire has no bearing on the working of the Congress-Sena-NCP alliance government in Maharashtra, the repeated warring has embarrassed both parties, apart from dangling, like an uneasy sword, over an increasingly tenuous alliance.Yuva Sena president and state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray was among those who distanced themselves from Raut's statements, calling them his personal views. Thackeray also said one should not dwell on the past. Congress functionaries in Delhi, meanwhile, attempted to downplay Raut's comments as Sena's long-standing policy on Savarkar.A Congress functionary in New Delhi said the alliance dharma said all partners agreed to abide by the common development issues that brought them together and maintain a ""studied silence"" on all other contentious issues."

NEW DELHI: Asserting that the uproar over the amended citizenship law and the Jamia-JNU violence will be a major factor in the Delhi assembly polls, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's ""subdued"" response to the issues ""smacks of opportunism"".He also said the Congress will play a ""significant"" role in the polls and exuded confidence that the party could get enough seats to emerge as the ""determining factor"" in government formation.""He (Kejriwal) did not show up in Jamia (Millia Islamia), he did not show up in JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University). His statements were not frequent enough, strong enough and open enough,"" Sibal told PTI in an interview.He said Kejriwal's somewhat ""subdued"" response to what has been happening around has not sent the right kind of signals.""It smacks of opportunism,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP, who is a member of the Congress' election and campaign committees for the Delhi polls.Asked if the massive uproar over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register ( NPR ), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the violence on university campuses will be a major factor in the polls, Sibal replied in the affirmative.""What has Kejriwal done? Kejriwal has not even visited the campuses, not even visited JNU, because this is politics,"" he said.""This is the problem when political parties take positions only for the purpose of an election, not for the purpose of what is right. People see through their acts,"" the former Union minister said.Sibal also alleged that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not talking much about CAA, NPR and NRC for the fear of losing a section of a vote bank that it ""desperately needs"".He asserted that Kejriwal has to answer to the people for his response to CAA, NPR and NRC.Asked if the Congress can form the government on its own, Sibal said, ""I don't think that we should be making such tall claims, but at the same time I think we will be a significant factor in this election, maybe giving us enough seats to be the determining factor in the formation of the government.""On whether the Congress can join hands with the AAP if it turns out to be the ""determining factor"", he said, ""Let us first get the results out in the open. What our strategy is will be known to everybody at that point in time.""Sibal also dismissed suggestions that the Congress' chances in the polls may be hampered by the absence of a popular and credible face, saying the credibility of a face has no relationship to the party's credibility in terms of its functioning on the ground.""In 2014, we had a credible face in (Narendra) Modi ji, that is what the people of India thought, see what has happened since then. So let us not talk about the faces. The face of the common man is far more important than the face of the chief minister,"" he asserted.It is only the Congress party that has always looked at the face of the common man or woman and worked towards his or her concerns, said Sibal, who has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice in the past from Delhi's Chandni Chowk constituency.Responding to a question about the Congress mounting a formidable challenge to the AAP, Sibal said his party does not have any seats in the Delhi assembly, so the ruling party certainly has an advantage.""I think they (AAP) claim more than what they have done on the ground. They have a fabulous media campaign. This is somewhat like our Prime Minister's media campaign which sort of tries to claim much more than what the reality is. I think the people know the reality. So let's see what happens,"" he said.The Congress leader claimed that the BJP is on a sticky wicket in the polls as it has ""lost credibility"" and people are very unhappy with it.He cited the examples of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, in which the poll pundits were proved wrong, to stress that a surprise could be in the offing in Delhi and his party could deliver a strong performance in the polls.""I think the people of Delhi, as a member Parliament and (someone) who has fought elections in Delhi I can say, have realised that it is the Congress party that has delivered in Delhi. There is no other party that has delivered in Delhi. As far as AAP is concerned, it has been in constant conflict with the Centre,"" Sibal said.""I remember the days when Sheila (Dikshit) ji was the chief minister and (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister. Even though we were different political parties with different ideologies, the administration worked together,"" he said.This talks well of Vajpayee's administration and Dikshit's quality to embrace everyone and get the work of the people of Delhi going, he said, adding that, Kejriwal doesn't have that art.""In a constant state of conflict, I don't think you can achieve much. I want to know how many great bridges have been built, how many underpasses have been built (under the AAP government). There is no infrastructure development at all,"" Sibal alleged.All the schemes that have been taken forward in Delhi have been the brainchild of the Congress, he said.Polling will be held on February 8 for the 70-member Delhi assembly and the results will be declared on February 11.The Congress is seeking to revive its fortunes in the national capital this time. It had won just eight seats in 2013 and drawn a blank in the 2015 Delhi assembly polls."

BENGALURU: As Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in Karnataka , Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Saturday sought to know why he doesn't visit the flood-hit areas and assess if funds provided by the Centre were enough, before ""brainwashing"" people to accept his ""divisive policies"".In a series of tweets the leader of opposition also sought an ""adequate"" probe into violent anti-CAA protests in Mangaluru last month during which two people were killed, and pointed out that people have cried foul about the incident.""Mr @AmitShah, Before investing time to brainwash people to accept your divisive policies, Why don't you visit flood affected areas again & assess if the Central govt funds are sufficient or not? #AnswerMadiShah,"" Siddaramaiah tweeted.""Mr. @AmitShah, @BSYBJP has claimed loss of over Rs 35,000 due to floods but your aid is just Rs 1,870 Cr.When are you planning to give the remaining?

What is your stand on the issue? #AnswerMadiShah, he said in another tweet.The Congress in Karnataka, in a series of tweets attacking Shah, asked why the central government was behaving in a ""dictatorial way,"" despite country wide public opinion against CAA, NRC.""Why don't BJP respect democracy and constitution?"" it asked.Alleging that BJP government in the state was only indulging in the ""business of transfers"", the party said the administration has not yet taken off."

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Defending the Kerala government's decision to move the Supreme Court against the controversial CAA CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday said there was no need to inform the governor before approaching the top court.Yechury also said that the country functions as per the Constitution and it was more important to protect it.His remarks came on a day when Governor Arif Mohammed Khan made it clear in Delhi that he may seek a report from the Left government for not informing him prior to moving the court.""The state and the country is functioning according to the Constitution of the country and not the Rules of Business.I don't think there is any need to inform the Governor about moving the Supreme Court,"" Yechury told reporters here.The Left veteran, who is here to attend the three-day meeting of the CPM's central committee, which began on Friday,said it was more important to protect the Constitution.""If there is no Constitution, there is no Governor nor the Government,"" Yechury said.Khan had earlier claimed that protocol and courtesy were not followed by the state government and he came to know about the state approaching the apex court through newspapers.The CPM on Friday also alleged that there was a central government-sponsored attack on anti-CAA protests and said more such agitations would follow in the coming days.""There is a central government-sponsored attack on the anti-CAA protests across the country.There is enough evidence to prove the police highhandedness with regard to this,"" Yechury said.The CPM also plans to organise protest marches against the CAA on January 23, the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, January 26 (Republic day) and January 30, (martyrs day) when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated.On January 26, mass reading of the preamble of the Constitution and oath taking would be held, he said.""Anyone can join the protest on these days. It's a general call. It's the stand of the political parties with regard to the CAA and that is more important,"" Yechury said.The central committee is expected to discuss various matters, including continuing the agitation against the Modi government, spearheading anti-CAA protests and collaborating with other movements to challenge the economic and agricultural policies of the BJP government."

NEW DELHI: BJP working president J P Nadda on Friday accused Rahul Gandhi of misleading the country on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and dared the Congress leader to speak 10 sentences on the law.Speaking at a programme organised by a Buddhist body in support of the CAA , Nadda said it is ""unfortunate"" for the country that some people ""exhibit their wisdom"" without understanding the issue so as to mislead the masses.""The Congress is opposing the CAA. I dare Rahul Gandhi to speak 10 sentences on the law. He should tell us in two sentences what is his problem with the CAA ... He is leading such a big party and has to decide himself how he has to do it, but he should not mislead the country,"" the BJP working president said.The amendments in the citizenship law are meant to give citizenship to members of minority communities who fled Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan due to religious persecution and took refuge in India, he said.Likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had advocated giving citizenship to these persecuted minorities but the Congress does not have any leader now who could understand the issue, Nadda said.Since coming to power for a second term, the Modi government has in six months resolved issues which had been pending for 70 years, he asserted, adding that opposition parties were left without any issue and had seized on the CAA to mislead the country.""For the Congress and the Left, their vote bank comes before the country. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country comes first and votes later,"" he said.Critics are claiming that crores of people will arrive and settle in India due to this law, but the fact is that it is for those who arrived here by December 31, 2014, he added.Opposition parties believe in keeping problems unresolved so that they could do politics over it while the Modi government has addressed issues like Article 370, he said.Minorities were persecuted in Pakistan and Bangladesh and their population, he claimed, fell to three and seven per cent respectively there from 23 per cent in 1947.Humanity demanded that the members of these minorities living in India be given justice so that they could join the mainstream and avail of education, health and job facilities, he said."

VIJAYAWADA: BJP and actor Pawan Kalyan 's Jana Sena have decided to forge a new political front in Andhra Pradesh . Both parties have come to an agreement to fight together all future elections in the state. The parties have clarified there will be no poll truck with any other party, including Telugu Desam.Although a proposal on the merger of Jana Sena with BJP had reportedly come up for discussion, the BJP leadership is believed to have strategically deferred the move saying an alliance would yield better results.Announcing the formation of the alliance on Thursday, BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana said Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan has unconditionally come forward to work with BJP. ""We are going to form the government in the state in 2024,"" said Kanna Lakshminarayana and Pawan Kalyan. They would chalk out an action plan to fight against the Jaganmohan Reddy government's plans to shift the capital city from Amaravati. Interestingly, BJP extended support to YSRCP's plans for relocation of high court to Kurnool.BJP state affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar said there would be no alliance with TDP in future. "" Will never join hands with TDP as it is deeply corrupt and ruined the state with its corrupt policies"". BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said the alliance was confined only to Jana Sena and they would not have truck with other political parties in the state.Backing BJP's stance, Pawan Kalyan said they have decided to jointly fight against TDP and YSRCP. He said people were waiting for a right third alternative as both TDP and YSRCP ""failed to give good governance""."

LUCKNOW: Making the fifth change in the leadership of her party in Lok Sabha in less than a year, BSP chief Mayawati has now appointed first time MP Ritesh Pandey (38), a foreign educated Brahmin from Ambedkarnagar, to head the party in the lower house.Pandey has replaced Danish Ali, who joined BSP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and was being perceived as the party’s Muslim face.While announcing Pandey’s appointment, Mayawati said that since a Muslim was already heading BSP’s state unit, she needed to give representation to other communities. Incidentally, with Pandey’s appointment, two Brahmins are now heading the party in Parliament — Ritesh Pandey in Lok Sabha and SC Mishra in Rajya Sabha Ali’s removal, his second since August, comes in an apparent bid to ensure “equal representation” of all communities within BSP, though sources in the party said Mayawati was unhappy with his frequent challenging of her hold over the party. “To bring about social equality in BSP, we have had to make some changes in the party since the Lok Sabha leader and UP state president are both from the same community. Ritesh Pandey is now the leader of the party in Lok Sabha while Malook Nagar is the deputy leader. BSP state president Munqad Ali will remain in his position,” Mayawati said. Ali, who was earlier the Janata Dal (Secular) general secretary in Karnataka , has experienced a rocky ride in BSP. Appointed leader of the party in Lok Sabha in June, he was first removed in August 2019 when he reportedly disagreed with the party’s support to the Centre on revocation of Article 370"

NEW DELHI: AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday got into a confrontation with BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir alleging that the saffron party would stop free essential services, like electricity, water and bus rides for women, if it came to power in the capital.Hitting out at chief minster Arvind Kejriwal , Gambhir said that he was not against free services for poor, but those who could afford them should pay nominal charges. Singh alleged that BJP leaders were continuously opposing the free welfare schemes of the AAP government.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari joined in by saying that no existing subsidy started by the AAP government would be altered. He alleged that AAP leaders were “habitual liars” and “misrepresented the facts” to suit their political interests.“I have repeatedly said that we will give five times the benefits given by the AAP government. Several central schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, which were stopped by the AAP government, would benefit people five lakh times, if implemented,” Tiwari said. Calling the AAP government’s free electricity and water scheme an election gimmick, Tiwari said the Kejriwal dispensation didn’t have any plans to give the facilities after March 31 as no such notification had been issued in this regard. “The order issued by the power department says consumers will get free electricity only till March 31. What we will give to people will be for 60 months,” he added.Singh challenged Gambhir to give up all the free facilities he received as an MP before opposing the benefits being provided to Delhiites. “Several BJP leaders have time and again conveyed their anti-development and regressive stance, including opposition to free basic services. It is good that their true intentions have been revealed before the election,” he added.The AAP leader stated that BJP MP Vijay Goel had recently announced that all free schemes would be stopped if his party comes to power. This was reiterated by Union minister Prakash Javadekar. “BJP leader Anil Jain stated that his party is against any kind of free services to people. Now, Gambhir has contradicted the claims made by Manoj Tiwari,” Singh said.“After coming to power again, the AAP government will continue the free services for the next five years. The inflation rate has been consistently rising due to the unfavourable policies of the central government. Instead of focusing on resolving inflation, they have been criticising the AAP government. In the current economic scenario, the free welfare schemes have provided a huge relief to people,” Singh stressed.New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi said BJP will spell out all benefit schemes it intends to launch in its election manifesto. “BJP will bring better schemes,” she added. A BJP source said, “The party’s Sankalpa Patra (election manifesto) will prove to be a game changer.”"

NEW DELHI: Some AAP MLAs remained committed to the party, some were disappointed while some were still deliberating on their future course of action after they were dropped from the party's list of candidates for the next month's Delhi assembly polls. The Aam Aadmi Party has dropped 15 sitting MLAs from its list of 70 candidates and given ticket to a total of 24 first-timers, including Atishi, Dilip Pandey and Raghav Chadha who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Kalkaji MLA Avtar Singh, who was replaced by Oxford-educated and AAP spokesperson Atishi, said he was still deliberating on what he would be doing next.""I haven't thought about what to do next,"" Singh said in response to a question on his plans.Unaffected by the AAP's decision to not give him a ticket in the upcoming polls, Timarpur MLA Pankaj Pushkar, who was replaced by Dilip Pandey, said he considers himself as a foot soldier of the party and not getting an assembly ticket is a very small part.""There is no question of running independently. It is a party consisting of honest people and strengthening this party has been my aim. I am not at all disappointed. It is part of democracy. Some decisions might hurt you. But it is a very small part,"" he told over phone.In a sharp contrast, Badarpur MLA ND Sharma quit the party hours before the list was announced and accused the AAP of selling tickets.""We joined the AAP for clean politics but now there is not much difference between AAP and other political parties now. The hard work of volunteers was ignored,"" Sharma said.Former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri's grandson Adarsh Shastri, who is a Dwarka MLA, has also been dropped from the party's list and replaced by Vinay Kumar Mishra, son of former Congress parliamentarian Mahabal Mishra.Sources close to Shastri said he is disappointed but plans to stay with the party.Delhi Cantt MLA Surender Singh is planning to contest independently.One of his close aides said he would be interacting with the people in his constituency and take a call on contesting as an independent candidate.On Tuesday, the AAP had announced its list of 70 candidates for the Delhi assembly polls, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal contesting again from New Delhi seat and his deputy Manish Sisodia from Patparganj seat.Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh said new responsibilities would be given to the sitting MLAs who were not been tickets for the assembly polls."

NEW DELHI: Coming as it does after the recent losses in assembly polls, spike in inflation just ahead of Delhi elections poses yet another challenge for BJP , which is also contesting in the capital without a CM face.The jump in inflation has come as a boost for BJP’s rivals who hope for a repeat of the 1998 polls when rising onion prices were seen as the primary reason for the party’s defeat in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Keeping a check on inflation has been one of the key poll planks of the party which had made it a major issue against the Manmohan Singh government in 2014.While opposition parties have upped the ante against the Centre over the increasing inflation, BJP functionaries are still hopeful that prices will fall, given that inflation has been under control under the Modi government and even buffered it against economic slowdown.BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP GVL Narsimha Rao said prices of vegetables and onions are seasonal in nature and the recent spike is temporary. He said prices would go down as supplies improved, adding, “State governments have a greater role and responsibility in ensuring lower prices of agricultural commodities.”"

NEW DELHI: Twenty-three new faces, including three who contested the last parliamentary polls in the capital and six recruits from rival parties , were among 70 candidates fielded by Aam Aadmi Party for the February 8 assembly polls in Delhi.Former MLAs Shoaib Iqbal, Parlad Singh Sawhney, Ram Singh Netaji, Chaudhary Surender Kumar, Dhanwanti Chandela and Vinay Kumar Mishra, who joined AAP recently, have been named nominees. Iqbal, a five-time MLA representing different political parties, had joined Congress ahead of the 2015 assembly poll. This year, he is the AAP candidate from Matia Mahal, his stronghold. Sawhney, a four-time MLA from Congress, has been fielded from Chandni Chowk, which he represented from 1998 till his defeat in 2015.Netaji, who won two assembly elections, once on a Nationalist Congress Party ticket and second as a BSP candidate, has been fielded from Badarpur. Former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra’s son Vinay and ex-Congress MLA Dayanand Chandela’s wife Dhanwanti have been fielded from Dwarka and Rajouri Garden, respectively. Surender Kumar, who won in 2008 on a BSP ticket, is the AAP nominee in Gokalpur. He had joined the BJP in 2019, but didn’t stay in that party for long. Talking to reporters, Vinay Mishra said he was impressed by the “revolutionary” work done by AAP, which prompted him to join the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. Interestingly, Mishra was a front-runner for a Congress nomination, but quit before that party announced its candidates.AAP has also fielded its prominent faces, Atishi, Raghav Chadha and Dilip Pandey, from, respectively, Kalkaji, Rajinder Nagar and Timarpur. The trio had contested and lost the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The candidatures of the three known for their political acumen gives AAP a formidable line-up. Another AAP functionary who has worked closely with the top leadership, Durgesh Pathak, will fight from Karawal Nagar, represented by Kapil Mishra, who is now with BJP.There are new AAP faces in Bijwasan and Gandhi Nagar, whose MLAs Devinder Sehrawat and Anil Kumar Bajpai had defected to BJP. B S Joon and Navin Chaudhary have been fielded from these two seats. The ruling party has also given a chance to new candidates in the Bawana, Mundka, Patel Nagar, Hari Nagar, Delhi Cantonment, Trilokpuri, Kondli, Seelampur and Sultanpur Majra constituencies."

NEW DELHI: With assembly polls less than four weeks away, the debate about giving free electricity , water and other amenities is heating up. East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir said people will stop valuing services if they get it for free. He said the governments must charge a nominal fee to ensure that people use them judiciously.To counter the AAP government’s schemes of free electricity and water to frugal consumers and free ride to women in public transport, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari promised “five times” the benefits being given by the ruling dispensation if elected to power.“If we say that BJP will give five times of what AAP government is giving, I think it is wrong. The AAP government made huge promises of building 500 schools, new hospitals and introducing 5,000 buses, but failed to deliver. We should make only those promises that we can fulfil. Otherwise, it will be a betrayal of people. They will feel cheated and used,” Gambhir said.Accusing the AAP government of “playing” with people’s emotions and betraying them for five years, Gambhir said BJP shouldn’t make the same mistake.The former international cricketer said, “We need to make people capable, not helpless. The AAP government offered free rides to women just three months before election because they are a huge vote bank. If Kejriwal was really concerned, he should have made buses and metro free for students who are short on funds.”The East Delhi MP also accused AAP of politicising the issue of Ghazipur landfill garbage slide and sought cooperation between the corporation and Delhi government to clean the area. He added that he has been at the landfill at least six times, but Kejriwal hasn’t visited the area even once.“It is our collective responsibility to find a solution to the problem. Instead of indulging in blame game, we need to join hands and work towards removing this huge mound of garbage,” Gambhir said.Gambhir said BJP’s top priority would be to provide clean air, potable water and safety and security to women. “Wherever I go in my constituency, people talk about contaminated water and polluted air. We should frame policies keeping in mind the poor who cannot afford air purifiers or RO machines,” he added.Just ahead of his maiden Lok Sabha polls, Gambhir got dragged into a controversy in which he was accused of distributing derogatory pamphlets against Atishi, his rival from AAP. The East Delhi MP has now decided to make this an issue in his public meetings wherein he would be targeting Arvind Kejriwal by asking people if they want a chief minister who doesn’t even respect a woman candidate from his party.Talking to TOI, Gambhir said he was badly hurt and wanted to give up politics after AAP’s allegations. “In desperation to win just one seat, he (Kejriwal) stooped so low. He talks about women’s security, but doesn’t even respect a woman candidate of his own party,” added the cricketer-turned-politician.Gambhir said if AAP was convinced that he distributed the pamphlets, it should have been proven by now. “If the allegation is proved, I will resign as MP. I have a family with two small daughters and would never do such a thing in life,” he added."

JAIPUR: Accusing the Congress of betraying the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) despite giving outside support to the government in Rajasthan , party supremo Mayawati on Monday did not attend the Opposition meeting called by United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi Mayawati also appealed to the Centre to make amendments to the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).In a series of tweets in Hindi, Mayawati said, “Despite giving outside support to the Congress in Rajasthan, they made the BSP MLAs join their party for the second time, which is betrayal.”“Thus, participating in the opposition meeting called by the Congress will be demoralising for the BSP. So BSP will not attend the meeting,” she said.Her remarks came ahead of the opposition meeting convened by Sonia Gandhi on the issue of CAA, NRC and attacks on students in Jamia Millia Islamia University, Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). In a big jolt to BSP supremo Mayawati, all six members of the Rajasthan Assembly belonging to Bahujan Samaj Party, joined Congress in September last year.Similar thing had happened during the previous Congress government. Gehlot poached all six BSP MLAS and inducted three ministers of state and three were made parliamentary secretaries equivalent to ministers of state.Lamenting at the central government over the controversial CAA, Mayawati appealed to the government to take it back.“The BSP is against the CAA and the NRC. BSP appeals to the government to roll back the divisive and unconstitutional Act. Even the politicisation of the students in JNU and other varsities is unfortunate,” the BSP chief added."

NEW DELHI: After five-time Matia Mahal MLA Shoaib Iqbal, Congress’ Vinay Mishra , a young functionary from west Delhi who is son of former party MP Mahabal Mishra , and Ram Singh Netaji from Badarpur joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday. Welcoming them with AAP caps, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said they were joining the party to work together for a better Delhi. The new entrants said they were impressed with AAP’s governance.“I am happy that these leaders are joining us to work together to create a better future for Delhi. I am sure that the day is not far when all 2 crore people of Delhi will join AAP, though that would be just a formality as AAP already resides in their hearts,” Kejriwal said, adding that the newly inducted functionaries would strengthen the party.Singh, who was elected as an Independent MLA in 1998 and as a BSP candidate in 2008 from Badarpur, had unsuccessfully contested on a Congress ticket in both 2013 and 2015. Mishra had lost from Palam as a Congress candidate in 2013 and could manage to poll only a little over 19,500 votes.People were fed up with the politics of BJP and Congress because both parties did not deliver on their promises and had elected AAP five years ago, said Kejriwal. “AAP has stayed true to the promises made in its manifesto and won hearts of all. Whether a supporter of BJP, Congress or any other party, AAP has gained a place for itself in every heart because of its sincerity. AAP has managed to touch and transform their lives with its work and this time they will vote for AAP, irrespective of personal party affiliation,” the AAP national convener claimed.Some other functionaries who also joined AAP included Jai Bhagwan Upkar, BSP councillor of Rohini-C; and Rajkumari Dhillon, a former Congress councillor of Hari Nagar.Mishra, who has his roots in Bihar, said AAP’s work in unauthorised colonies and hospitals and on education had impressed him the most. “I have seen how people from UP, Bihar and other states had to struggle to get medical treatment, education and other facilities here. The condition of unauthorised colonies improved only after AAP came to power.”Singh, known to have a stronghold in Badarpur, said, “Everyone in Delhi has witnessed the hard work of Kejriwal and his government. Everybody is excited about AAP’s model of development. After a long stint in Congress, I want to be part of a system that delivers tangible welfare for Delhiites.”Miffed with Singh’s induction, Badarpur MLA Narayan Dutt Sharma demonstrated outside deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s house on Monday night."

VADODARA: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) and the proposed National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) exercise are aimed at ""dividing"" the country on communal lines, former Union minister Yashwant Sinha said on Monday.He claimed Mahatma Gandhi , if he were alive today, would have led an agitation against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for taking ""communal"" decisions.Sinha, who was in the city as part of his Gandhi Shanti Yatra, demanded scrapping of the CAA, which aims to give Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.""Several state governments want the CAA repealed and the NRC exercise dropped. The CAA should be repealed as it is aimed at dividing the country on communal lines. We do not want another division of the country,"" he said.""We remained silent despite the Modi government destroying the cabinet system, ordering demonetisation, introducing GST hurriedly.""But after the CAA and NRC, there is need for the youth to raise their anger on issues that will weaken the country,"" the former BJP leader claimed.""If Mahatma Gandhi were alive today, he would have led an agitation against Modi because the government is taking decisionson communal lines,"" he said.""Members of the Muslim community are proud of holding the tricolour in their hands. And it was Babasaheb Ambedkar who drafted the Constitution and made India a secular country.""We will not allow the hidden agenda of Modi behind the CAA and NRC to succeed,"" the bureaucrat-turned-politician asserted.Speaking on other issues, Sinha questioned Modi for not inviting Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a pre-budget meeting.Former Lok Sabha MP and Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha and ex-Gujarat chief minister Suresh Mehta were present on the occasion.The 3,000-km-long yatra, which started in Mumbai on January 9, will cover Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana before before culminating at Raj Ghat in Delhi on January 30, coinciding with Mahatma Gandhi's death anniversary.The march has been organised to demand repeal of the CAA, a judicial inquiry into ""state-sponsored violence"" such as the January 5 attack on JNU students and assurance from the Centre in Parliament that there will be no nationwide NRC."

KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday claimed that her party TMC was the first to voice its protest to the Parliamentary Standing Committee against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and none can question its opposition to the amended Citizenship Act.She claimed that the Parliamentary Standing Committee record clearly states that TMC was the first to air its opposition to the CAB at the committee's meeting and asked the opposition parties who were speaking against her to check it.Slamming the Left parties and the Congress who blamed her for a ""secret understanding"" with Prime Minister Narendra Modi without naming them, Banerjee said ""None can question or doubt mine and TMC's credentials in fighting against the CAA , the NRC and NPR"".The two opposition parties had criticised her and charged her with having a ""secret understanding"" with the Prime Minister for meeting him at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday after his arrival to the state and sharing the stage with him at the inauguration of the sound and light show at the Howrah Bridge by Modi.The TMC supremo, who is a strident critic of the BJP, said West Bengal is not like Uttar Pradesh where several protesters were killed in police firing during protests against the CAA. ""We always protect the democratic rights of people.""The chief minister, who was addressing an anti-CAA protest rally by Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad (TMC stundents wing) also hit out at BJP saying ""They (BJP) have made PAN, Aadhaar, ration cards invalid. We will not allow them to do that"".Banerjee iterated her call to ""fight the BJP tooth and nail as they are anti-people"".Turning to her critics, she said ""Those who are criticising TMC have no credential. They only believe in tokenism like calling a bandh once in a year.""Lashing out at the Congress and the Left parties, the TMC supremo said ""Have they ever taken the trouble of walking on the streets? Have they ever organised social programmes? Been on the side of the people? Some people launch movements merely to gain publicity.""Taking at a dig at her critics, she said ""Do you want to see me finished? You are mistaken. Mamata Banerjee has always been on the forefront of people's movements"".Keeping up her attack against CPI(M) and Congress, Banerjee said ""You seem to have no differences with the BJP as you also conspire to create law and order problem in the state through violent protests.""About the arson and road blockade in the state on January 8 during the nationwide general strike by trade unions, she said no agitation is successful if the protestors commit violence.She said the TMC will launch a strong movement ""from the Hills to plains"" from January 22 in every block of the state and appealed to the non-BJP parties to hit the streets to wage a ""anti-Modi movement""."

CHENNAI: Taking a dig at the media, senior Congressman and former Union finance minister Chidambaram on Friday chided people for believing ""everything that is written"".""When the government says, there is 5% growth, we believe. When it says 100% of all our villages have been electrified, we believe it. When it says 99% of villages have been provided with toilets, we believe. We even come to a level, where we believe in fake news ,"" he said on Friday at a function.He also said that the country is being ruled by fear. It is the responsibility of the people to decide whether they want to live with fear or freedom. ""It is fear that is ruling India and not a political party. Fear and freedom cannot go together. It is the responsibility of the people to choose whether they have to live a life with fear or freedom. We all should live a life without fear,"" he said.""I predicted in 2018 about economic slowdown hitting the country. I am not proud for having predicted it. Others like former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan too warned the country about economic slowdown. But, our warnings were never heeded to by those in power,"" Chidambaram said."

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Thursday parted ways with the Left Front and Congress on the issue of ""jointly opposing"" the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. It also backed out from moving an all-party resolution in the state assembly against the Centre's contentious moves, as West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee expressed her ""disappointment"" with the ""nasty politics"" of the two parties.Mamata cited the violence during Wednesday's all-India strike, called by central trade unions against ""the BJP government's anti-worker policies"", and announced that she would be staying away from the meeting of opposition parties in New Delhi next Monday to register her protest against the Left Front and Congress's ""hooliganism"" in Bengal. The meeting was called by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi over the incidents of campus violence and the CAA.Trinamool's decision comes two days before PM Modi's visit to Kolkata to attend the 150th-anniversary celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust.Wednesday's strike call had turned violent in Malda district after several police vehicles were torched. Buses and motor-bikes were damaged, and highways, crucial road junctions and railway tracks were blockaded in several spots in the state.""Let the people of India know that I have dropped my plans to visit Delhi on January 13 to protest against their hooliganism. I choose to withdraw even though I had urged opposition parties to meet,"" the Bengal CM said.""I will protest against CAA and NRC and these people will set buses on fire, plant bombs under trains?

SRINAGAR/JAMMU: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) found itself in the middle of a crisis on Thursday after it expelled eight former MLAs for ""engaging with the government"", and its founder member Muzaffar Hussain Baig hit out at former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti for her ""provocative"" remarks, which, he said, resulted in the downgrading of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories.The partymen were expelled after they met the 15 foreign envoys who were taken to Srinagar to assess the situation in the Valley on Thursday.""PDP expels leaders for going against the will of the people,"" the party said in a press release posted on its official Twitter handle.All eight - Dilawar Mir, Rafi Ahmad Mir, Zaffar Iqbal, Abdul Majeed Padroo, Raja Manzoor Khan, Javaid Hussain Baig, Qamar Hussain and Abdul Rahim Rather - are former MLAs.""In view of the development post August 5 and the unilateral move of the government of India which has violated the will and hurt the sentiments of people, it has come to the attention of the party that certain party leaders have been part of the parleys which go against the interests of the state, official position and core beliefs of the party,"" the release said. The expelled functionaries have thrown their weight behind former PDP leader Syed Altaf Bukhari and were part of a delegation that met lieutenant governor GC Murmu on Tuesday.Meanwhile, senior PDP functionary and former deputy CM Muzaffar Hussain Baig on Thursday told reporters that party chief Mehbooba Mufti's remark that no one would be left to hold the tricolour in J&K if Article 370 was tampered with resulted in the state's bifurcation. Baig said, ""I was not personally present when she (Mehbooba Mufti) made these remarks but they were provocative and her remarks resulted in downgrading of the state into Union territories. That did not help us… The statement should not have been made."" Baig said one cannot ""threaten"" the top leadership in New Delhi to see one's grievances being heard. ""If J&K has to live together and if we have to bat for our rights, we have to talk with decency and humility,"" he said.""We cannot get anything by browbeating and threatening Modiji, home minister or NSA. As citizens of India, we should put before them our grievances and our problems with humility,"" he added.In Video: PDP expels 8 party leaders over meeting foreign envoys’ delegation"

NEW DELHI: AAP is likely to release within a week the list of its candidates for the Delhi assembly elections scheduled on February 8. AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai on Tuesday said the list would be released by January 14.The outcome of multiple qualitative and quantitative surveys being conducted in all 70 assembly constituencies will decide the fate of the 61 sitting party MLAs. “Most of our MLAs have worked well but wherever we need to change the MLAs, we will do it,” chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal said at his last town hall on Tuesday.AAP had stormed to power in 2015 with 67 seats, but had lost Rajouri Garden to BJP in the 2017 bypoll and towards the end of the term, five of its MLAs were disqualified under the anti-defection law. AAP is now assessing the performance, public connect and opinion, and winnability of each MLA through the surveys, being conducted by it and some agencies.There is speculation that AAP may drop close to 25% — or around 15 — of the sitting MLAs. The party, which claims to be on a strong footing due to its work in the past five years, is trying to not allow the anti-incumbency factor affect its performance in the elections.Senior functionaries Raghav Chadha, Atishi and Dilip Pandey, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from South, East and North East Delhi constituencies, respectively, are likely to be fielded in this election. They have been handling various responsibilities in the party and representing it at various forums. The party is, however, yet to declare any seat for any of them."

NEW DELHI: BJP chief Amit Shah on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believed in delivering what was required for society without bothering about popularity ratings, adding that the Centre had taken several bold decisions which successive governments didn't dare to take for reasons like appeasement or vote bank politics ""Modi has acted against three curses of Indian politics - appeasement, casteism and nepotism. This government works on efficiency and by keeping welfare of the people as the guiding principle, rather than vote bank politics. India has not seen a leader like Modi who takes strong decisions, in the interest of the nation and its people, without fearing backlash,"" Shah said.After releasing a book 'Karmayoddha Granth' on the life of Modi, Shah said the PM was the epitome of selfless service. He added that the government's decisions had shaped a strong image of India globally and Modi had revamped India's foreign policy and national security policy by de-linking the two.""India emerged as a strong nation on the global stage while making its stance clear that India will not take attacks on itself lying down. India has emerged as a global power by taking bold decisions, including removal of Articles 370 and 35A in J&K, bringing Citizenship Amendment Act , resolution of Ram Mandir issue, criminalising triple talaq, conducting surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes , which nobody dared in the last 70 years,"" the BJP chief said.Shah said Modi had not only changed the political narrative by keeping the party manifesto at the centre of regovernance but had also taken tough decisions for people's welfare without caring about the consequences.""The government is functioning on an ideology which keeps Deen Dayal Upadhyay's 'Antyodaya' at the centre,"" he added.Sharing his experience of working with Modi, Shah talked about the three phases of the PM's life, starting from dedicating his life to an ideology, entering politics on the ideals of the ""sangathan"", and finally upholding the tenets of parliamentary democracy and the Constitution to construct a welfare state.""Modiji's childhood was devoid of luxury, full of poverty, disadvantages and neglect from society but he has dedicated his life towards the welfare of people, without having any ill-feeling for anyone in society,"" Shah said.He added that the Modi government had inherited a government plagued with corruption but had delivered a non-corruptible government since 2014, laying the foundation for a new India."

MUMBAI: A surprise meeting between Maharashtra Navnirman Sena president Raj Thackeray and leader of opposition and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday fuelled speculation of a new political front emerging in Maharashtra.While a MNS spokesperson confirmed the meeting, he declined to elaborate on the deliberations between the two leaders, once at loggerheads.Fadnavis met Raj Thackeray - the estranged cousin of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray - at a venue in south-central Mumbai this afternoon for around an hour.The meeting is considered significant as the MNS is toying with the idea of claiming the 'Hindutva' space vacated by the Shiv Sena after its alliance with the BJP broke in October and it hugged Nationalist Congress Party-Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in November.The BJP too has been trying to come to terms with the tectonic shift in the state political arena after the October 21 elections with huge ramifications for the party in the future.However, during the assembly election campaign, the MNS had been extremely harsh on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP, its president and union home minister Amit Shah.In his well-attended poll meetings, the charismatic Raj Thackeray even fervently appealed to the electorate to vote for MNS as a ""strong Opposition party"", but managed to bag only one seat, virtually putting a question mark on its future and survival.Earlier during the Lok Sabha election, the MNS has experienced a taste of realpolitik when both fronts - BJP-Shiv Sena and NCP-Congress kept Raj Thackeray at an arm's length.After being treated as virtually a political pariah in two successive elections, the 14-year old MNS is busy exploring greener pastures possibly with a saffron partner, well in time for the 2024 assembly polls.Simultaneously the MNS is also planning to turn a new leaf, starting with a change in its party colours to a saffron hue and a new design flag invoking Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's glorious regime.MNS leaders say any final decisions on these would be taken by Raj Thackeray at an important convention scheduled later this month."

NEW DELHI: Top leaders of opposition parties, including the Congress , are likely to meet on January 13 to discuss the situation arising out of violence on various university campuses and protests in the country over the Citizenship Amendment Act.According to sources, the Congress is convening a meeting of senior opposition leaders next Monday in Parliament House annexe to chalk out a joint strategy in the wake of violence on campuses.The sources said Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, DMK chief MK Stalin and leaders of Left parties and regional outfits opposed to the BJP are likely to attend the meeting.They add that top opposition leaders have already held discussions amongst themselves and leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad is leading the efforts.The opposition is seeking to win over the youth and students by supporting their protests over the citizenship law and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).The sources said the Congress and other parties are seeking to take the students movement forward and have lent support to their cause.There has been violence in Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University, besides some other campuses across the country, in the recent past following student protests against the citizenship law and NRC.The joint opposition move also assumes significance as it comes soon after Delhi election dates have been announced.The elections to the 70-member Delhi assembly will take place on February 8 and results will be declared on February 11, the Election Commission announced on Monday.The last time a majority of opposition leaders got together was at the swearing-in of Hemant Soren as Jharkhand chief minister."

NEW DELHI: The gong has been struck for a three-way showdown between AAP, BJP and Congress with the Election Commission announcing assembly polls in Delhi for February 8 even as turmoil over violence during anti-CAA protests in Jamia Millia Islamia and Sunday's attack on JNU students roils politics.The results, despite a usually limited role of ""national"" issues in state polls, will be seen as a verdict on recent incidents that have seen BJP and its opponents clash over allegations of ""majoritarianism"" and ""intolerance"" with regard to violence on campuses and legislations like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).Electioneering promises to be heated and hectic as CM Arvind Kejriwal looks to retain the AAP fort after finishing behind Congress in the Lok Sabha polls. For BJP, the challenge is to regain a turf it held only once and reverse a trend of setbacks in state polls where regional and local factors seem to prevail over national issues.With polling on February 8, results will be declared on February 11. Announcing the schedule on Monday, CEC Sunil Arora, along with EC Ashok Lavasa, said over 1.47 crore voters are eligible to vote on 70 assembly seats. The polls will be notified on January 14, nominations can be filed until January 21 and withdrawn by January 24.The current Delhi assembly expires on February 22. The last assembly election in 2015 delivered a massive landslide win for AAP, which won 67 seats, leaving only three for BJP. Congress, which was in power for 15 years before that, drew a blank.With polls announced in the midst of continuing anti-CAA protests in some parts of Delhi and Sunday evening's violence at JNU, the CEC, responding to a question on law and order, said, ""I won't say we (the commission) are very sanguine, but we are hopeful that they (police) will be able to control the situation (and make it) conducive for polls."" He added that in an extraordinary situation, the EC had the power to defer polls.After having failed to expand beyond Delhi and further losing its gains in Punjab in the May 2019 Lok Sabha elections , a defeat for AAP will be a severe setback. But as of now, it enjoys frontrunner status as Kejirwal engages in a major public outreach over populist initiatives and claims of a significant improvement in areas like education.On the other hand, scandals and resignations have hurt his government that has lost the campaigning aura it had in 2014 when it was born from the Anna Hazare movement.AAP will hope differentiations between state and national polls will work in its favour and Kejriwal has also changed his earlier tactic of attacking PM Narendra Modi and clashing with the Centre over a range of issues. BJP hopes that AAP will not have the benefit of the extraordinary surge that powered it to 67 seats and is reaching out to unauthorised colonies and slums with its regularisation plans and a promise of faster development.Congress is the third player in the game and did surprise by pushing AAP to third place in the Lok Sabha polls. There is, however, concern over its organisational health post Sheila Dikshit, who had been a popular chief minister over three consecutive terms. Also, while in the Lok Sabha polls, it was seen as a contender at the Centre by anti-BJP voters, the case might be different in state elections where AAP is looking to consolidate minority votes - a section both parties are fiercely competing for.A favourable outcome will help BJP reverse the trend of setbacks in state polls. It will bank on the vote getting ability of its mascot, Modi, and hope efforts to get city heavyweights to pull along sees the party put up a more united front than has been the case for several years. Replicating the 55% vote share in the Lok Sabha elections is a tough task and Congress's performance may influence outcomes.Kejriwal said his party was ready for the ""battle"" and exuded confidence that it would be reelected even as home minister Amit Shah took on AAP, claiming that it had failed to deliver on several fronts. The chief minister said elections would be a referendum on the work of the AAP government.""Vote for us if you think that we have done work. If we haven't, don't vote for us,"" he said.The model code of conduct has kicked in and will apply to candidates, political parties and Delhi government, besides the Union government in so far as announcements and policy decisions pertaining to NCT of Delhi. It will not affect the Union budget 2020-21 on February 1.The EC had, in a ruling on January 23, 2017, in view of polls in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur, directed that ""in the interest of free fair elections and in order to maintain level playing field during elections, no state-specific schemes shall be announced in the national budget, which may have the effect of influencing electors of the five poll-going states in favour of the ruling party"".For the first time in Delhi and second after the Jharkhand polls, senior citizens above 80 and physically challenged voters can vote from home using the postal ballot facility. While the pilot project in Jharkhand covered only seven constituencies, the EC will now extend this across all 70 assembly constituencies in Delhi.AAP is projecting Kejriwal, who overshadows everything and everyone in the party. Out of office since 1998, when it lost to Congress, BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari said people have ""seen through"" the lies of AAP in the last five years and made up their mind to give chance to the saffron fold.In Video: Delhi elections 2020: BJP banks on Modi magic to counter Kejriwal charisma"

NEW DELHI: The BJP faces a tough task as it seeks to oust the AAP from power in Delhi on the back of its national planks like CAA coupled with the Centre's decision to give ownership rights in unauthorised colonies. Meanwhile chief minister Arvind Kejriwal banks on a mix of populist schemes and personal appeal to repulse the saffron challenge to Aam Aadmi Party in the February 8 assembly polls.With BJP president Amit Shah leading the charge by accusing Kejriwal and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of instigating ""riots during the anti-CAA protests, the saffron party has made it clear that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be a key issue in the assembly polls.Kejriwal has, however, avoided to confront the BJP on national issues. He has been muted in his criticism of the CAA, while vowing to fight the polls on local matters and governance.Shah and Union minister Prakash Javadekar , who is BJP in-charge for the Delhi polls, have also accused Kejriwal of failing to fulfil any major promise he had made in the 2015 polls, asserting that it will also be a major election issue.As the national capital has witnessed protests against the CAA, some of which turned violent, BJP leaders are of the view that their aggressive campaign can help the party against any major erosion to the near 57 per cent vote share it bagged in the city in the recent Lok Sabha polls.If a big chunk of Muslim votes sway to the Congress, currently seen as a distant third, due to its top leaders' vocal opposition to the CAA, then it may queer the pitch for the AAP.The Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP and the Congress had won 54, 32 and nine per cent votes respectively in the 2015 assembly polls, as Kejriwal led his fledgling party to an unprecedented victory bagging 67 seats in the 70-member assembly.The BJP was reduced to three seats, suffering its first electoral shock following its string of wins in state polls after Prime Minister Narendra Modi led it to a historic 2014 Lok Sabha win.The BJP is hopeful that the Modi government's decision to confer ownership rights to occupants of unauthorised colonies will help it win over the poor living there, seen as a support base of the AAP. The party says the decision will benefit up to five million people.On the other hand, the AAP is bagging on its populist schemes like free power to households for up to 200 units of consumption, free water and free bus ride for women besides its work to boost education and health facilities.Modi's charisma was back at work in the 2019 general election as the BJP won more than 56 per cent of votes and all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. The Congress came second with 22 per cent votes and the AAP followed with 18 per cent.However, in the recent assembly polls the BJP suffered massive swings away from its Lok Sabha vote share in different states. It lost over 22 per cent votes in Haryana and Jharkhand.While it managed to retain power in Haryana in alliance with Jannayak Janata Party, it failed to form government in Maharashtra and was defeated in Jharkhand. It was also ousted from power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in 2018.Delhi BJP is often seen as a factional house and this coupled with the lack of a chief ministerial pick to take on Kejriwal is believed by political watchers as a handicap for the saffron campaign.BJP leaders, though, point out that the party's decision to name Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial face in 2015 had boomeranged. They contend that the party has won many state polls by fighting under collective state leadership.Much is at stake for the saffron party which after suffering a series of setbacks in recent assembly polls is likely to pull out all the stops to return to the winning ways in states, as another defeat will further embolden the opposition and fuel doubts about BJP's electability when the brand Modi is not at stake."

PUNE: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday credited former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar for supporting him in forming the Progressive Democratic Front government in Maharashtra in 1978.Addressing an event at Bharat Yatra Centre in Parandwadi where a bust of late Chandra Shekhar was unveiled, Pawar recalled his association with the socialist leader.""Chandra Shekhar was always ready to work for people at the grassroot level. He never compromised on his principles and I was fortunate that I got the opportunity to work with him for several years,"" he said.Pawar said that despite having good relations with Indira Gandhi , Chandra Shekhar stood against the Emergency and even went to jail.""I can't forget when political crisis had taken place in Maharashtra after some differences in the Congress (in 1978). The state was in need of a stable government and Chandra Shekhar told me that 'you (Pawar) have to take responsibility of the government', and extended his party's support to me,"" the four-time chief minister said.""As he kept his word, I got the responsibility to lead the state and the credit goes to him,"" Pawar added."

MUMBAI: BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday demanded that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ban a booklet distributed by the Seva Dal which questions Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's credentials as a patriot.The Hindi booklet, titled """", was distributed at a camp of the Congress-affiliated organisation in Madhya Pradesh.The book alleged that Savarkar, after his release from Andaman's Cellular Jail, received pension from the British, and he and Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse were in a physical relationship.Fadnavis, a former Maharashtra chief minister, said the Congress had exhibited its ""wicked"" psyche by circulating such a booklet, which underscored its ""intellectual bankruptcy"".""The BJP strongly condemns the booklet. Venerable Hinduhriday-samrat Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray would have been the first to react in his archetypal style (to the booklet) had he been around,"" he said, using the popular epithet of `king of Hindu hearts' for the Sena founder.""Today, cannot have such an expectation, but expect that the chief minister announces immediate ban on the book,"" Fadnavis said in a series of tweets.He also sought to know from the Shiv Sena ""which entered into unnatural alliance with such a bankrupt party"" (the Congress) if it will repeatedly entertain insults to its ""deity"" Savarkar for the sake of power.The Sena formed alliance with the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra after severing its ties with the BJP.Earlier in the day, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had slammed the booklet. Veer Savarkar was a great man and will remain a great man. A section keeps talking against him. This shows the dirt in their mind,"" Raut said.Last month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's jibe that his name was not ""Rahul Savarkar"" and hence he would not seek apology (about his remark on rape) had riled the Sena.In Video: Devendra Fadnavis slams Congress over Savarkar booklet"

SILIGURI: Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ""frequently comparing India with Pakistan"", West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday wondered if he was an ""ambassador of Hindustan or the neighbouring country"".Banerjee, while addressing an anti-citizenship law rally in Siliguri, said it was a shame that people were being asked to prove their nationality, even after 70 years of Independence.""India is a big country with a rich culture and heritage. Why does the PM regularly compare our nation with Pakistan? Are you the prime minister of India or the ambassador of Pakistan?""Why do you have to refer to Pakistan in every issue? You (Modi) should rather speak of Hindustan. We don't want to be Pakistan. We love Hindustan,"" she said.Modi had on Thursday dared the Congress and its allies to raise their voice against Pakistan's atrocities on its minorities for the past 70 years.Banerjee, who is also the TMC supremo, said the prime minister and his party spoke of Pakistan every now and then to divert attention from the prevailing economic crisis and unemployment in India.""If someone says give me job as I have no work, PM says go to Pakistan. If someone says we don't have any industries, he says go to Pakistan. Pakistan can talk about themselves as much as they want, we should talk about India, this is our motherland, all of us were born here..."" she said.The TMC boss vowed to continue her protests till the amended citizenship Act was repealed.She accused the BJP of ""deliberately"" creating confusion over the implementation of National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), saying its leaders have been making contradictory statements on the issue.""On one hand, the prime minister says there will be no NRC; on the other, the union home minister and other BJP ministers claim the exercise will be conducted across the country,"" she added.Talking about recent clashes over the citizenship law in Uttar Pradesh, which claimed several lives, Banerjee, in a veiled attack on her counterpart Yogi Adityanath, said, ""Those that cannot rule are governing major states.""Dubbing her fight against the amended law as the ""second war of Independence"", she said, ""They (BJP) just know how to divide the nation on the basis of religion. But my religion is to defend the freedom of people. We have to save the country from bigotry,"" she added."

TUMAKURU (K'TAKA): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday slammed the Congress and its allies opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, saying they are against giving relief to those who have been brutalised and victimised in Pakistan.""Pakistan was founded on religious grounds due to which atrocities on minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Christians have increased. But Congress and its allies don't speak against Pakistan,"" he said at a function here.He also said the Congress and its allies take out rallies and stage demonstrations against the efforts to prevent atrocities on religious lines and save women from sexual assaults.Modi wondered why those opposed to the CAA were not speaking out against Pakistan's atrocities and asked what stopped them from doing so.Strongly defending the CAA, he said it was adopted by Parliament in a historic move, but that the Congress and its allies and the ecosystem created by his party's rival were now against the very institution.He said India cannot leave the Hindus, Christians and Sikhs apparently fleeing Pakistan to ""their fate"" and added it was the country's responsibility to protect them.Modi pointed out that the efforts are especially to protect the Dalits and tribals in Pakistan.The Prime Minister also pointed out that the abrogation of Article 370 was a step towards ending terrorism and uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir.In Video: CAA: If you have to agitate, raise your voice against Pak atrocities: PM Narendra Modi in Tumakuru"

NEW DELHI: The year 2019 will go down as a watershed in the BJP 's journey as the party not only achieved its highest ever tally in Lok Sabha but also realised its decades-long ideological planks with the Modi government pushing the saffron agenda with renewed vigour in its second term.However, it was not altogether a smooth run for the BJP as regional satraps in alliance with the Congress succeeded in dethroning it in Maharashtra and Jharkhand while nationwide protests against the citizenship law and the concept of National Register for Citizens pushed it on the defensive.The scale of protests prompted its top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah , to decouple the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with the NRC, and it remains uncertain as to how the saffron party will push on with its ideological agenda in the face of mounting challenges.All debated and done, party leaders are likely to look back at 2019 with more than a touch of satisfaction as the year saw nullification of Article 370 , criminalisation of triple talaq, enactment of CAA and a Supreme Court order paving the way for Ram temple construction in Ayodhya, issues which have agitated Hindutva cadres for decades.If the results of the April-May general election underscored the BJP's preeminence in national politics with the party winning 303 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, its footprint in state governments was reduced to a mere 35 per cent of the country's landmass from the peak of 71 per cent in 2017.If the outgoing year again highlighted the appeal of 'brand Modi', it also brought to light the BJP's vulnerability in state elections when the prime minister and national issues are not driving factors for the common voter's choice.The massive mandate of 303 seats in the general elections, however, set off its own unintended consequences for the party, which managed to ruffle feathers of quite a few allies with its ""big brotherly"" airs.The BJP lost its Hindutva ally Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the JD(U), which is now its biggest partner, is yet to get over the slight of being offered merely one cabinet berth in the Modi government as a ""symbolic representation"", as Bihar party leaders recalled disdainfully. JD(U) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar summarily rejected the proposal.The year also saw the rise and rise of Shah as he after being inducted as the home minister in the second Modi government was the face of the central dispensation in pushing its major decisions with distinct ideological hues.Whether it was the nullification of Article 370, bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, strengthening of anti-terror laws or the passage of the amended citizenship bill, Shah spearheaded the government's agenda and took on the opposition with his usual mix of combative articulation and ideological clarity.Even when he focussed his energies on leading the party during the first term of the Modi government, there was never a doubt on who is the real number two in the organisation after Modi.And it was no coincidence that Shah was at the helm of the government's drive to carry out the BJP's central Hindutva planks in the second stint of the government.A Supreme Court in the favour of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya has came as a boost to the party.The BJP organisation is expected to undergo a shake-up in the new year as Shah is likely to make way for its working president J P Nadda at the top.When the ongoing organisational elections end, expected in January, the party may have some new faces in its structure but is unlikely to change its course much from the path laid down by Shah in more than five and an half years of his term.In terms of the upcoming electoral challenges, the new year is likely to pose some tough question to the saffron war machine as it prepares for the assembly polls in Delhi and Bihar.Arvind Kejriwal-led Aap Aadmi Party had defied the pro-BJP sentiments in the 2015 polls and handed the main rival its worst drubbing in the national capital by winning 67 seats in the 70-member assembly and reducing it to three.BJP leadership has been working overtime to come back to power in the city which handed it all seven Lok Sabha seats in the general election, as was the case in the 2014 polls too, but is hamstrung by the lack of a face to take on Kejriwal, who is backing on his populist schemes to retain power.The Election Commission is likely to announce the dates for Delhi polls soon.In Bihar, many observers believe the BJP in the alliance with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP is better placed against the rival RJD-Congress combine after winning all but one of its 40 Lok Sabha seats.However, there is also a view that the chemistry between Kumar and the BJP is far from perfect and differences may crop up between them over sharing of seats in the assembly elections.JD(U) leaders have indicated that they want their party to fight on more seats than the BJP in the politically crucial state.Amid rancour in their ties after some BJP leaders sniped at Kumar, Shah had walked the extra mile earlier to bring the alliance back on track by asserting that the JD(U) president will again lead the NDA in the state assembly polls, which are due later this year."

AURANGABAD: Four Muslim faces in the Uddhav Thackeray ministry have come as a major boost for Congress and NCP considering the challenge from AIMIM in the state.The Hyderabad-based party had dented Congress-NCP’s prospects over the past few elections, including Lok Sabha and assembly, by eating into Muslim votes. Shiv Sena too has extended an olive branch to the Muslim community by appointing Abdul Sattar, a firebrand MLA from Sillod in Aurangabad district, as a junior minister.The other Muslims inducted into the cabinet are Nawab Malik, Aslam Shaikh and Hasan Mushrif. Malik, a Pawar acolyte and NCP’s key minority leader, was re-elected to the state assembly from Mumbai. Mushrif is also a force to reckon within NCP. Kagal, near Kolhapur, is his bastion.Aslam Shaikh is a Congress MLA from Malad West. A senior MIM functionary said, “This will impact MIM and help strengthen the Congress-NCP base among the minorities.”"

MUMBAI: Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Monday reprimanded two ministers on the dais during the swearing-in ceremony at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai for deviating from the written text of the oath of office and speaking some lines extempore.When Congress MLA K C Padvi was taking oath as cabinet minister in the state government during the expansion of the ministry, he added a few lines of gratitude to his voters after reading out the written oath text.Koshyari, in a stern tone, immediately asked the Congress MLA to stop and told him to “read out the written text only”. “This will not do. Take the oath again,” the governor directed the seven-term legislator who represents Akkalkuva in north Maharashtra. While leaving the dais, Padvi apologised to the governor, who gave him a smile of acknowledgment.Before this, Koshyari intervened when Congress MLA Varsha Gaikwad invoked Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar’s name while taking the oath of office and secrecy. The governor stopped Gaikwad mid-way and asked her to stick to the written content while taking oath.Gaikwad is a four-term MLA from Dharavi in Mumbai. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday expanded his council of ministers by inducting 26 cabinet and 10 ministers of state."

MUMBAI: Debutant MLA Aaditya Thackeray (29) was on Monday inducted as cabinet minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by his father Uddhav Thackeray , making them the first father-son duo to be part of the cabinet together in Maharashtra The NCP's Ajit Pawar, who had rebelled against his uncle Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to become his deputy during the second, short-lived Fadnavis-led government that collapsed in 80 hours, returned as deputy chief minister as 36 ministers in the three-party government of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress took oath in the cabinet expansion effected at Vidhan Bhavan more than a month after Uddhav became chief minister on November 28.Though no allocation of portfolios took place on Monday, with Uddhav saying they would be allocated in a day or two, the NCP has secured the crucial home department from the Shiv Sena.""The Sena has both urban development and home departments. We asked Uddhav Thackeray to allot us home. The Sena has agreed,"" a senior NCP leader told TOI.While most other portfolios are expected to stay with the parties which had got them when they were initially divided between the seven ministers—2 each from the Sena, NCP and Congress, apart from Uddhav—who were sworn in at Shivaji Park, there are still differences within the NCP on who gets home, sources said. At the moment the NCP has, among the plum portfolios, finance and planning, water resources and housing, and the Congress has got revenue and public works. Allocation of Congress portfolios is likely to be finalized by the high command on Tuesday, sources said.Aaditya's induction took not only Sainiks but also the NCP and the Congress by surprise as no other chief minister in the state had earlier inducted his son or daughter into the state cabinet, though such precedents exist in other states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Though other dynasts such as Ashok Chavan (son of late CM Shankarrao Chavan), Amit Deshmukh (son of late CM Vilasrao Deshmukh), Sunil Kedar (son of senior neta Babasaheb Kedar), Varsha Gaikwad (daughter of ex-Congress MP Eknath Gaikwad) and Aditi Tatkare (daughter of NCP's Sunil Tatkare) were among those sworn in, Mantralaya mandarins said that with Uddhav as CM, Aaditya's induction appeared out of sync with the time-honoured rule in state politics that the 'beta-beti' brigade could take measured steps on the highway to power.Stating that Aaditya's swearing-in took his party by surprise, a Congress veteran said, ""There is no question of Sena taking NCP-Congress into confidence before choosing its ministers. After all, allies are free to finalize their own list, regardless of the views of other partners."" Pointing out that Congress had evolved a mechanism for transfer of power to the young generation, he said, ""The first step is to give them party matters. Even Pandit Nehru refrained from inducting Indiraji into his cabinet. She was elected Congress president when Nehruji was PM. Sanjayji (Gandhi) was appointed president of Youth Congress when Indiraji decided to get him into politics. Ditto with Rajivji.""Maharashtra Congress stalwarts like Yashwantrao Chavan, Vasantdada Patil, A R Antulay and Shankarrao Chavan, too, kept their children out when helming the state as CM, the Congress leader pointed out. A bureaucrat said in 2000, NCP chief Pawar did not induct his daughter Supriya Sule into the Congress-NCP ministry but ""asked her to go through the paces before she could claim her place in the sun.""While 26 ministers sworn in on Monday got cabinet berths, 10 were inducted as junior ministers. The cabinet strength is now 43, which is 15% or the maximum number possible for the 288-member assembly. The NCP has 16 ministers, the Sena 15 and Congress 12.Congress's ex-CM Prithviraj Chavan was among those who did not find a place in the cabinet; he is likely to make a pitch for the state Congress chief's post. Ashok Chavan, who lost the CM's post in 2010 after facing charges in the Adarsh scam made it; he had earlier been rehabilitated as state party chief. Congressman Vijay Wadettiwar also made it to the ministry. From NCP, Dhananjay Munde, who defeated cousin Pankaja in Parli, Anil Deshmukh and Rajendra Shingne were among those inducted, and the Sena list included, party general secretary Anil Parab from Mumbai, Sanjay Rathod from Yavatmal and, as junior minister, Congressman-turned Sena MLA Abdul Sattar."

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ’s choice of 12 new Shiv Sena ministers has triggered resentment in a section of party MLAs who couldn’t make it to the final list. Vikhroli MLA Sunil Raut, who was reportedly given to understand that he was dropped at the eleventh hour to accommodate Aaditya Thackeray , said he was planning to resign from his assembly seat.Sunil is the brother of Sena MLA Sanjay Raut , the Saamna executive editor who was instrumental in paving way for the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. When Sanjay stayed away from the swearing-in, tongues wagged. However, Sunil later clarified that he was a “true and loyal Sainik”.This came after Uddhav asked Sanjay not to precipitate matters. Sanjay himself played down the issue, saying, “People should understand we don’t have many options since it’s a government of three parties and there are capable people in all three.”Sources close to Sanjay said he doesn’t attend stiffcollared “sarkari” events and his absence from the shouldn’t be linked to Sunil being dropped. However, he was present when Uddhav and six others were sworn in on November 28.While sources said the CM had quashed the dissent by Monday evening, other sources said Aaditya’s induction has created a flutter in Sena though none is willing to go on record.Sena MLAs from Mumbai Sunil Prabhu and Ravindra Waikar, both of whom skipped the swearing-in ceremony, are said to be miffed. Several Sena activists from Vidarbha are also said to be unhappy as the “ignored their region”.Earlier in the day, a Sena MLA from the rural heartland, on knowing that he was not to be sworn in as minister, rushed to Thackeray’s residence and sought an explanation from the CM, it is learnt."

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday expanded his over a month-old ministry by inducting 36 ministers, including his 29-year-old son Aaditya, while NCP leader Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy chief minister.Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari administered oath to 14 ministers from NCP, 10 from Congress and 12 from Shiv Sena at Vidhan Bhavan (state legislature) premises in south Mumbai.The expansion, which raised the strength of the state ministry to 43, came over a month after the Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power.The 36 ministers sworn in on Monday include 10 Cabinet and four ministers of state of the NCP, eight Cabinet and four MoS of Shiv Sena, and eight Cabinet and two MoS of Congress.The NCP now has 12 Cabinet ministers and four MoS, the Shiv Sena has 10 Cabinet ministers and four MoS while Congress has 10 Cabinet ministers and two MoS.Ajit Pawar was sworn in as deputy chief minister, while former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan and Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray were among the Cabinet ministers who took oath.Pawar was sworn in to the post for the second time in just over a month.Pawar had taken oath as deputy CM on November 23 after he rebelled against the NCP and joined hands with the BJP. However, he resigned on November 26, leading to collapse of the three-day Devendra Fadnavis government.Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan did not find place in Thackeray's ministry. There is speculation that he may lead the state Congress unit.BJP leaders - and Sena MP Sanjay Raut - skipped the ministry expansion ceremony.""This government has not fulfilled the expectations of Maharashtra's farmers. We don't feel like attending the ceremony,"" a BJP leader said.Another BJP leader said, ""When Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in at Shivaji Park last month, state BJP leaders, including Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, were present. There is no need to attend every cabinet expansion ceremony.""Raut's absence was attributed to his brother Sunil Raut, a Sena MLA, not finding a place in the ministry expansion.The Shiv Sena kept its senior leaders Ramdas Kadam and Diwakar Raote, who were ministers in the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government, out of the new council of ministers.Instead, it included allies Shankarrao Gadakh (of Krantikari Shetkari Paksh) as Cabinet minister, and Rajendra Patil Yedravkar (Independent) and Bachchu Kadu (Prahar Janshakti Party) as ministers of state.Senior NCP leaders Nawab Malik and Anil Deshmukh, who were ministers in the previous Congress-NCP government, also found place in the ministry.The two leaders were defeated in the 2014 Assembly polls, but emerged victorious in the state elections held in October this year.NCP leader and former Assembly speaker Dilip Walse Patil, former leader of opposition in the Legislative Council Dhananjay Munde and former LoP in Assembly Vijay Wadettiwar were also sworn in.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar were among those present at the swearing-in ceremony.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi ministry led by Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in on November 28.Balasaheb Thorat and Nitin Raut of Congress, Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai of the Shiv Sena and Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal of the NCP took oath along with Thackeray.The size of council of ministers cannot exceed 15 per cent of the total number of MLAs, which is 288 in the state. As a result, Maharashtra can have a maximum 43 ministers.The Shiv Sena last month joined hands with the Congress and NCP, its traditional adversaries, after its alliance with the BJP collapsed over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.The Shiv Sena has 56 MLAs, NCP 54 and Congress 44 members in the 288-member Assembly. The BJP has 105 MLAs."

LUDHIANA: Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday termed the Citizenship Amendment Act ""divisive and dangerous"" for the country, reiterating his stand that his government will not allow its implementation in the state.Addressing Congress leaders and workers during a protest march here, Singh urged people to unite against the ""draconian"" legislation and said his party would fight ""tooth and nail"" against it.""Indians should unite against BJP's divisive and dangerous attempts to destroy the nation's secular fabric with the draconian Citizenship Amendment Act,"" said Singh.""My government will not allow the implementation of the CAA in Punjab and the Congress will fight against it tooth and nail,"" said Amarinder Singh, who was joined by senior Congress leaders Asha Kumari and Sunil Jakhar.The CM said the BJP could not get away with its ""nefarious designs"" and pointed out that protests against the ""draconian Act"" were continuing in 16 states.He also read out the preamble of the Constitution, terming it India's foundation which, according to him, should not be disturbed.While constitutions were amended from time to time across the world, no one could tolerate tinkering with their basic structure, he said, adding that even the United Nations had termed the CAA ""discriminatory"".He also lashed out at the alleged manhandling of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi by police in Uttar Pradesh, saying it could not have taken place without CM Yogi Adiyanath's knowledge.""Aren't you ashamed of such actions,"" he asked Yogi Adiyanath, warning that the Congress ""would not forget this incident and tables would tun one day"".The chief minister said while the entire world was expressing concern over the ramifications of the legislation, ""those sitting in Delhi continued to be adamant, refusing to pay heed to the voice of the nation"".He also invoked Guru Nanak Dev, saying the Sikh Guru preached secularism by saying """" (nobody is a Muslim or Hindu, all are God's people).The CM said the protest march held in Punjab's economic heartland would help send the anti-CAA message across India.In an informal conversation with mediapersons later, Amarinder reiterated that his government would continue to oppose the Centre's attempt to ""destroy India's secular character and change the preamble of the Constitution"".Earlier, senior party leader and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal equated the alleged manhandling of Priyanka Gandhi by the UP Police with that of Mahatma Gandhi's removal from a train in South Africa.In a reference to the CAA, Manpreet said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to send Indians out of the country, the Congress ""will turn him out of India"".Noting that the BJP had secured a mere 39 per cent votes in the last Lok Sabha elections, he asserted that with the remaining 61 per cent supporting the opposition parties, the Modi government could not get away with the enactment of such ""black laws"".PPCC president Sunil Jakhar lambasted the BJP-led Union government for allegedly trying to implement the agenda which the ""goras"" (British) had failed to execute."

PATNA: Days after ally BJP’s ouster from power in neighbouring Jharkhand , JD(U) on Sunday began mounting pressure on the saffron party for a larger share of seats in the upcoming assembly polls in Bihar Allies JD(U) and BJP had contested 17 seats each in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, while remaining six seats (out of total 40) were given to the third ally Ramvilas Paswan’s LJP.“As per my understanding, there is no question of BJP and JD(U) contesting on equal number of seats in the assembly election. The seat-sharing formula of Lok Sabha cannot be justified for the state assembly polls— JD(U) is a bigger party in Bihar,” JD(U) national vice president Prashant Kishor told reporters.“Election will be contested with JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar as the face, hence the ratio of seat sharing between BJP and JD(U) cannot be 1:1. The basis of seat-sharing talks between BJP and JD(U) should be 1:1.4 or near to it. It may even be 1:1.3,” Kishor added.To justify his claim, Kishor pointed out that JD(U) and BJP had distributed seats during 2010 assembly election on the ratio of 1:1.4. “Moreover, even if the number of seats won by BJP and JD(U) in 2015 assembly election are taken into consideration, the ratio will come around 1:1.4,” he said.Kishor’s statement seeking more seats for JD(U) has created fresh ripples within NDA circles in Bihar, drawing sharp reactions from BJP leaders. BJP legislator Nitin Navin asked whether Kishor was authorised by JD(U) to speak on the issue of seat sharing. “It may be his personal opinion. Top leaders of BJP and JD(U) will sit together and discuss seat-sharing issues at the appropriate time,” Navin told reporters.Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI, “BJP believes in maintaining decorum, discipline and not to make any public statement (on seat sharing) which has only news value. All the decisions in the NDA related to election 2020 is a matter of discussion between our top leadership.”"

NEW DELHI: The controversy over National Population Register (NPR) refuses to cease. While opposition parties including Congress are opposing the Narendra Modi government's decision to implement it, the country had witnessed sharp differences within the Congress-led UPA government over the issue about eight years ago .On Friday, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi registered a strong protest against NPR calling it an attack on the poor people. Speaking in Raipur, he said, ""Whether NPR or NRC (National Register of Citizens), it is a tax on poor people of the country… Poor people will have to go to officers and show their documents and give bribe. They will have to give bribe if there is a slight mistake in their names. Crores of rupees will be pulled out of the pockets of the poor and will be given to the same 15 (rich) people. This is the truth. It is an attack on the people,"" he said.However, NPR was launched during the UPA rule in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks on November 26, 2008. The resident identity card programme was initially meant for the nine coastal states. However, under the then home minister P Chidambaram in 2010, the scheme was sought to be extended to the rest of the country.The home ministry sought Rs 6,700 crore to fund the programme, which was supposed to distribute cards using data-carrying chips, photographs and fingerprints of the holder.However, the then Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) chief Nandan Nilekani objected to the resident identity card scheme. UIDAI was in the process of collecting data for the government's Aadhaar project The two government departments were fighting over the use of biometrics and the issue of duplication of data.The home ministry maintained that the Registrar General of India (RGI) under it was mandated to collect data through the NPR. UIDAI claimed that it had also been authorised to do the same.Chidambaram sought clarity from then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh whether RGI or UIDAI would collect biometric data. The home ministry doubted the security of the data collected by UIDAI as it was not verified by a government servant.UIDAI had hired private agencies to collect data which was objected to by the home ministry.In a bid to resolve the issues, Manmohan Singh convened two meetings of senior cabinet colleagues. The first one was held on January 25, 2012. Besides Ahluwalia, the meeting was attended by the then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram, Nilekani and the then National Security Advisor (NSA) Shivshankar Menon.Two days later, a cabinet meeting was held to resolve the issues. It was agreed in the meetings that the purposes of home ministry-led NPR and UIDAI were different and, therefore, both would continue simultaneously.It was also decided that the two agencies would use the biometric data collected by each other. But in case of discrepancies or duplication, the data collected by NPR would prevail.But slowly and gradually while Aadhaar project got a major push, NPR was rendered to a secondary status.While the government approved Rs 6,649.05 crore for creation of NPR, it allocated Rs 8,962.06 crore for the Aadhaar project.Moreover, Pranab Mukherjee, as finance minister, wrote to the chief ministers of states and Union territories to speed up the roll-out of Aadhaar-enabled payments for various government schemes.The arrangement between UIDAI and NPR was explained by the then Union minister of state for home RPN Singh in the Lok Sabha on December 11, 2012.In a written reply, Singh said the UPA government had decided that enrolment for NPR would continue as envisaged. But, if in the course of enrolment, a person indicated that she or he was already enrolled for Aadhaar, the biometric data would not be captured by NPR. Instead the Aadhaar number would be recorded in NPR and the biometric data would be sourced from the UIDAI, he said.Singh further said, ""The demographic data for creation of NPR was collected in a separate schedule along with the first phase of Census 2011 ie, Houselisting and Housing Census 2010. Further, as per Indian Census Act , 1948 data collected under census is confidential and can be used only for statistical purposes.""NPR was a bone of contention between UPA ministers eight years ago and it is in the midst of raging controversy along with Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC."

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday accused the opposition ofand spoiling the atmosphere in the national capital by misleading people, asserting that the time has come to ""punish the 'tukde tukde' gang"".Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone of East Delhi Hub — the country's first transit-oriented development project, he trained his guns at the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, ahead of the assembly polls due early next year.The Congress has rejected the allegation levelled against the party by Shah.""The opposition led by the Congress created confusion about the Citizenship Amendment Bill (now an Act). Delhi saw people coming out on streets over it and the peaceful atmosphere of Delhi was spoiled after a long time.""I want to say it with a lot responsibility that by misleading Delhi and its people (on the Citizenship Amendment Act or CAA ), the opposition spoiled the peaceful atmosphere of Delhi,"" Shah said on the recent protests, some of which turned violent in areas such as Jamia Nagar and Seelampur.Exuding confidence about BJP's performance in the coming polls, he said the time is up for the Kejriwal government in Delhi and ""the lotus will bloom"" here too.""Should you not choose a government that will bring peace in Delhi. When the CAB was discussed in Parliament, no one was ready to tell anything... They started spreading confusion over it later and spoiled Delhi's peace. I want to say, the Congress-led tukde-tukde gang, who are responsible for Delhi's peace getting spoiled, time has come to punish them, people of Delhi should punish them,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the Left-leaning intellectuals opposing the amended citizenship law.Taking on Kejriwal, he said the AAP dispensation obstructedand urged people to choose a government in next election that will ensure peace in Delhi.""Kejriwal has not implemented Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat. He only wants to put his name on our pet projects,"" Shah said.The event organised by the Delhi Development Authority was also attended by Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Lt Governor Anil Baijal, East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir, North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari, and Delhi MLA O P Sharma.""Delhi, you gave (us) all seven BJP MPs, now time to give BJP MLAs (a chance) in the next polls for development of the national capital,"" Shah, also the BJP president, said.Shah also attacked previous Congress governments over what he alleged was their ""tardy pace of work"", and said the Modi government has brought a ""new work culture"".""Congress would take five years to conceive a project, next five to allocate budget, another five to lay foundation for those projects, and then it would forget,"" Shah alleged.""In Modi government, the foundation stone laying and inauguration happens in the same government and this East Hub project, work on which would begin very soon, is set to be completed in three-and-a-half years,"" the home minister said.Kejriwal is ""doing advertisements for projects"" instead of doing actual work, he said.""For 57 months, Kejriwal and his government did not do any work. And for last three months, they are doing ads,"" Shah said.Puri too attacked the Kejriwal government and alleged that the AAP dispensation had been ""creating roadblocks"" for various projects."

PUNE: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday took a dig at the Shiv Sena ’s former ally BJP and said NCP chief Sharad Pawar had taught him how to form a government with fewer MLAs.In the presence of Pawar, Uddhav said, ""Pawar has shown how to cultivate more sugarcane in less space. He has performed a miracle in politics by forming a government with fewer MLAs. He has taught us how to form a government with fewer MLAs.""Even if the BJP had more numbers, the Sena could defeat it with fewer MLAs, Uddhav added. He was speaking at the annual general body meeting of the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSl) in Manjari near Pune. The CM also referred to PM Modi’s speech at the VSI in 2016, where he had called Pawar his guide, saying that the Maratha leader had hand-held him and taught him during his early days as CM of Gujarat. ""I won’t say it was a mistake,"" Thackeray said.Thackeray noted that those who had shifted loyalties before the state elections and joined the BJP may now join the Maha Vikas Aghadi.BJP functionary Harshvardhan Patil of Indapur and Pawar’s ex-cabinet colleague Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil of Akluj were on the dias with Pawar and Thackeray. Both are board members of the institute. Patil had left Congress by blaming NCP for backstabbing him and fought the state election on a BJP ticket. Mohite-Patil's son Ranjitsinh joined BJP and campaigned for the BJP candidate in Madha during the Lok Sabha elections. ""Some leaders sitting on the dais have become our coworkers. Those who haven’t may work with us,"" he said."

RAIPUR: Congress has won seven of the 10 municipal corporations in Chhattisgarh , keeping up the momentum gained from victories in the Dantewada and Chitrakot assembly bypolls in the last three months.BJP — which had held complete sway for 15 years — ended up winning only one civic corporation. Congress won 1,283 wards while BJP bagged 1,131. As many as 364 Independents won, and Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) got only six.In the last civic body polls held in 2015, Congress had won six municipal corporations. The seven corporations where Congress will form boards this time are Raipur Durg , Ambikapur, Jagdalpur, Chirmiri, Raigarh and Bilaspur. BJP won Korba. Neither party could get majority in Rajnandgaon and Dhamtari.Congress, which was out of power in Durg for close to two decades, wrested it from BJP by winning 30 of the 60 seats. BJP could win only 16 while others bagged 14 seats.In Dhamtari, Congress and BJP are neck and neck with 18 and 17 seats while others won the remaining five. In former CM Raman Singh ’s native place of Rajnandgaon, Congress won 22 seats while BJP was a close second with 21. Elsewhere in the state, Congress won 19 of the 39 municipalities while BJP bagged 16.CM Bhupesh Baghel called it a “historic victory”. “The municipal poll results show that citizens have placed their confidence in the state government,” he said, calling it a “one-sided triumph” for Congress.BJP national vice-president Raman Singh accused Congress of misuse of power. “BJP put in tremendous effort but had to face defeat”. He alleged Congress deliberately ignored EVMs and went for paper ballot."

NEW DELHI: The occasional appearance of the peacock still adorns its sprawling lawns, the security in and around the building continues to be on its toes, but the occupant of one of Lutyen Delhi's most significant address has changed. The tall banyan trees at the 6 A, Krishna Menon Marg has seen history being made from the Atal era right through when he was bed-ridden due to his illness and finally witnessing Amit Shah making it his ""home"". Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in more ways than one an unique personality -- a bachelor Prime Minister, a champion of women's rights, a poet and an unapologetic follower of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which made him go to jail as well.Vinod Mehta, a former journalist who was very close to Vajpayee had recounted in his memoir 'Lucknow Boy', ""My relations with Vajpayee were good. Very good...He was leader of the Opposition and I often found myself sitting next to him at banquets. He didn't say much, but listened with interest. Like Ronald Reagan he loved jokes. He was not overly humble, but neither was he pompous. He knew his own worth and therefore did not need to prove anything.""When his government fell in 13 days, many in the opposition ranks would mock him as ""Prime Minister of 13 days"". His next tenure lasted for 13 months. While, Vajpayee never went on record to answer opposition's dig at him, he was well aware of the scoff he was subjected to. But one fine day, he told media while answering on the instability of the Government, after the 13 months ""Raj"" came to an end, that his next Government will be of 13 years and he will come to be known as the Prime Minister of 13 years. It clearly showed the man occupying the highest office of the country could take jokes cracked on him, so easily.Vajpayee's poetry and him using it in his public life was unparalleled. In many of his election rallies to Parliament speeches, he would recite poems he had written. Legends have it that when the BJP got just two seats in 1984 election, a heartbroken L.K. Advani took Vajpayee for a movie at Delhi's Golcha cinema. Years later, at a book release, Advani himself said after coming back that night Vajpayee had penned, ""Aao fir se diya jalaye"". The poem would go on to become one of the best remembered ones written by him.Ironically, when Advani was narrating the tale, Vajpayee was reduced to a vegetative state, lying in his 6 A Krishna Menon Marg residence, that hardly saw any visitors.Vajpayee in his pinnacle of power, when he was the Prime Minister in 1996, had joined a Rediff chat, a very new phenomenon in India at that time. With internet still in its early stages and no medium like Twitter available where politicians could directly talk to people, he chose to try that out. His aides Shakti Sinha and Kanchan Gupta reportedly helped him when he decided to engage in the chat.Vajpayee was a man who could take people along and rise above the narrow concept of partisan politics. Often referred to as ""Ajatshatru of Indian politics"", former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had fondly remembered Vajpayee to be too eager to help her in bringing Delhi Metro. This was quite unlike today's political scenario where the ruling Aam Aadmi Party accuses the Governor of working at behest of the BJP-led Union Government.When he died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the almost entire cabinet, walked during Vajpayee's final journey. The overpowering emotions visible in all political attendees, particularly from the non-BJP parties, was an evidence of the place he held in India's polity. Yet, his final years have been of a rather sorry state when he could barely recognise anyone.Even as Shah walked into the sprawling Krishna Menon Marg residence this year, making it the power centre of Delhi, Vajpayee's memories will forever be etched across every corner of that estate."

MUMBAI: When chief minister Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena expands his cabinet on December 30, controversial NCP partyman Ajit Pawar will be inducted as deputy chief minister. However, he may not take up the home portfolio, which already is with the Shiv Sena but which may be controlled soon by another NCP leader.If a senior NCP partyman is to be believed, Ajit Pawar was to be brought into the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s cabinet on November 28 itself, when Thackeray took oath as CM at Shivaji Park . However, NCP president Sharad Pawar decided it would be best to induct him at a later stage in view of Ajit’s “mistake” of joining hands with the BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis.Ajit had been sworn in as Fadnavis’s deputy on November 23 before the second Fadnavis-led regime collapsed in just 80 hours as Pawar’s ‘rebel’ nephew resigned following his inability to mobilize the support of NCP legislators to keep the government afloat.The NCP partyman said the party had the option of allotting Ajit the water resources department which he had held earlier, home, or finance and planning. “However, Ajit Pawar has informed the NCP leadership that he would prefer the finance and planning department and that he is not keen on either water resources or home,” he said.The NCP partyman said that along with Ajit Pawar, 36 new cabinet members – 13 belonging to the NCP, 13 to the Sena and 10 to Congress will be sworn in on December 30."

RANCHI: A day after the JMM, Congress and RJDP mahagathbandhan registered a landslide victory in the Jharkhand assembly polls, chief minister-elect and JMM working president Hemant Soren met governor Droupadi Murmu at Raj Bhavan and staked claim to form the 11th government in Jharkhand. Earlier in the day, Hemant was formally elected JMM Legislature Party leader, a party source said here.Soren is likely to meet Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Wednesday or Thursday.Accompanied by his father, Shibu Soren , younger brother Basant, AICC Jharkhand in-charge R P N Singh, RJD working president Tejashwi Yadav , the mahagathbandhan’s elected MLAs and a battery of party functionaries, Soren drove into Raj Bhavan at around 8.40pm and formally handed over the letter of support of 50 MLAs to Murmu, following which he was invited to form government. A Raj Bhavan communique later confirmed the developments.Soren said he would invite Sonia Gandhi, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi to the swearing-in ceremony. He also plans to invite Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, former UP CMs Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee Asked if he would invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had congratulated him in a Twitter post on Tuesday, Soren said: “Of course. If he takes time out to attend the ceremony, it will be very nice.” “We met governor madam and handed her the letter of support of 50 MLAs. The oath-taking ceremony will be held on December 29 afternoon at Ranchi’s Morhabadi Ground,” Hemant said after the meeting at Raj Bhavan. However, he did not specify how many ministers would take the oath with him on Sunday.The mahagatbandhan denied BJP a second consecutive term, winning 47 out of 81 seats. JMM won 30 seats, Congress 16 and RJD one. Babulal Marandi’s JVM-P, which walked out of the mahagatbandhan before the polls , also gave the unconditional support of its three MLAs to Soren on Tuesday .In Video: Swearing-in ceremony to take place on Dec 29: Hemant Soren"

NEW DELHI: If BJP and AJSU Party had fought as allies and not separately, they would still have fallen short of a majority but only just, winning 40 seats in the 81-member Jharkhand assembly. They would also have reduced the JMM-led alliance’s tally to 34 thereby becoming clear favourites to form the government, analysis of seat-by-seat vote share data shows.The BJP-AJSU combined vote share of 41.5% was six percentage points higher than the JMM-Congress-RJD tally of 35.4%. With a gap of that magnitude, you would generally expect a clear majority, but that is not what adding up AJSU and BJP votes in each of the 81 seats shows.If we assume that the partner that actually won more votes in each seat would have been the one to contest it and assuming a complete transfer of votes between the two parties (another big if), BJP would have won an extra 9 seats and AJSU another 4, taking their tallies to 34 and 6.On the other side of this equation, JMM would have lost 9 seats and Congress 4, reducing them to 21 and 12, respectively. RJD’s lone win would have been unaffected by a BJP-AJSU alliance.Interestingly, none of the seven seats won by Babulal Marandi ’s JVM (Prajantantrik), NCP, CPI(ML) and independents would have seen any change in the outcome even if BJP and AJSU had contested jointly. In six of these, the NDA tally would have crossed UPA’s but would have fallen short of the actual winner’s. In the lone seat won by NCP, since BJP did not contest, there would have been no change in the outcome.Of course, this is all based purely on arithmetic. The chemistry of a possible alliance, or a lack of it, could have yielded very different results from these.The data also serves to clinch the argument between the two estranged partners on what a fair seat-sharing arrangement would have been. There were a total of 8 seats on which the AJSU got more votes than BJP, including the two seats it won. In a fair arrangement based on relative strengths, therefore, BJP should have contested 73 seats and AJSU 8."

MUMBAI: Amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has said there are no detention centres in the state and Muslim citizens need not worry under his regime.He gave the assurance to a delegation led by some MLAs from the Muslim community who called on him on Monday.Talking to PTI, NCP MLA Nawab Malik, who was part of the delegation, said the chief minister assured that Muslims will not face any injustice in the state.The chief minister assuaged concerns of the community, saying the detention centre at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai was meant for foreign nationals involved in drug peddling cases, said Malik, whose party is an ally of the Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.Only 38 people can be kept there (Kharghar detention centre). It is meant for foreign nationals following their release from jail, before they can be extradited to their country of origin, Malik said quoting the chief minister.""People should not have any misunderstanding about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. My government will not allow rights of citizens from any religion or community to be hurt. I appeal for peace and harmony in the state,"" the NCP leader said quoting the CM.Maharashtra Home Minister Eknath Shinde , Industries Minister Subhash Desai , Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal, Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve, Shiv Sena MLA Abdul Sattar and Congress MLA Amin Patel were also present on the occasion.During a rally in New Delhi on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress, its allies and ""urban Naxals"" of spreading the rumour that Muslims will be sent to detention centres.""The citizenship law or the NRC have nothing to do with Indian Muslims. They have nothing to worry,"" Modi said at the rally.Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said his government had put up a proposal to set up a facility for temporary keeping of foreign nationals whose visas have expired.""Yes. Cidco (City and Industrial Development Corporation) was asked to provide a land (in Navi Mumbai) to set up a centre for those foreigners who are found living in India beyond the visa expiry period. It is wrong to call such a facility a detention centre,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of miles from Jharkhand Maharashtra logged the strongest reaction to BJP’s defeat in the tribal state. But even before Congress could give a reaction, Shiv Sena called the verdict a setback for BJP, losing state after state. NCP chief Sharad Pawar was more direct. “It is the defeat of BJP. Those who are leading the party will have to take responsibility for it, be it the PM or the party president,” he said.The quick reactions in Mumbai to developments in Ranchi gave the impression of a tectonic shift. The result of a small, 81-member assembly could hardly be a national story. But against the backdrop of BJP’s sweep in the 2019 LS polls in May, Jharkhand joined hands with Haryana and Maharashtra in suggesting that state polls are different and the opposition offers more effective alternatives than on the national stage.If Pawar found Jharkhand consequential enough for a national statement, it is because during 2014-19, states shadowed the Modi-steered Delhi picture and kept falling in BJP’s kitty with unerring regularity.A buoyant opposition believes pressure from the ground will not only hurt the Modi-led BJP with popular vote but also with partners. Sena bolting to the ‘secular’ camp, it is hoped, can force a reassessment among other parties. The perceived spectrum includes JD(U) of Nitish Kumar or southern outfits like YSRCP, or BJD of Naveen Patnaik — parties with an official or unofficial saffron tilt.Not all allies may be looking to jump the ship. But their red flag to NRC and CAA itself is a bold statement, marking that they are ready to speak out against the “Hindutva project” of BJP as against Modi 1.0 when they looked the other way.This is where a wily power player like Pawar spots a sign of “political realignment”."

RANCHI: The Jharkhand results on Monday delivered a morale-boosting victory for the opposition with the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance winning a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81, and another state slipping out of BJP’s hands after its big sweep in the Lok Sabha elections that returned Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a record second term. Hemant Soren of JMM is set to take over as chief minister, returning to the job he held for a year before BJP won in 2015. The oath ceremony will take place on Thursday.BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014, its decision to contest alone after failed negotiations with regional ally AJSU Party backfiring and the party ceding the status of “single-largest party” for the first time. The contrast to the sweep in the LS elections — BJP won 11 and AJSU one of Jharkhand’s 14 seats — a little over six months ago was astonishing.Till late in the evening, the JMM-led alliance had 47 out of 81 seats. While JMM had 30 seats, Congress had 16 and RJD one. JMM and Congress posted their best-ever shows. Soren, the working president of JMM, won from Dumka and Barhait seats in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana.The saffron loss seems to be the fallout of several factors. The break with AJSU Party may have proved critical as the vote share of the two parties — BJP (33%) and AJSU (8%) — suggests that they could have made a fight of it if the alliance had held. Incumbency woes returned to haunt BJP with chief minister Raghubar Das losing his own Jamshedpur East seat to BJP rebel Saryu Roy by a margin of over 15,000 votes.The nullification of Article 370 , the Ayodhya verdict and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act could not give BJP an edge. Besides Das, BJP state president Laxman Gilua too lost his seat. If the CM suffered from an image problem, his upper hand in government and party also had a negative fallout. The sidelining of rivals led to a dependence on Das and though BJP did not totally lose the development narrative, the lack of a regional ally and the coalescing of tribal sentiment behind the JMM-led alliance proved too strong to overcome.Coming on the heels of the unexpected post-poll loss in Maharashtra, the Jharkhand result means that BJP is out of office in another important state.After its Lok Sabha win, BJP has found the going tough in elections in states where it has been the incumbent, holding on to power in Haryana with the help of Dushyant Chautala’s JJP. In Maharashtra, BJP underperformed in terms of exit poll projections even though it won comfortably in alliance with the Shiv Sena only to face the desertion of its saffron twin.The seeming alienation of the tribal vote, accentuated by the split with the OBC-driven AJSU Party, appears to be a fallout of the misfired attempt to amend the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act. While the intent was to give tribals greater say in disposal of their lands, it was read as an anti-tribal move. JMM and Congress shrewdly exploited this perception and turned a key voter segment towards them.The Jharkhand result saw the opposition claim that BJP’s decision to raise “divisive” issues like CAA and a nationwide NRC has backfired. How such issues can play out in a national election cannot be easily determined, but in the immediate context, they failed to make up for incumbency and a ruptured alliance. BJP’s failure has provided an opportunity for Congress and other opposition parties to argue that there is a space for an anti-BJP narrative and smart alliances can work.Congress functionaries said issues of jobs, food security, agrarian crisis, among others, worked with voters. Congress in-charge RPN Singh said, “The verdict is also a referendum against BJP’s CAA-NRC, Ram temple, Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir versus jal, jungle, zameen in Jharkhand.”For the opposition, the key was the smooth manner in which seat-sharing was arrived at with Congress willingly accepting the junior partner’s slot. After some bargaining, Congress also agreed on projecting Hemant Soren as the alliance’s CM face. The alliance that had done so poorly in the Lok Sabha elections — even JMM’s pater familias Shibu Soren lost — bounced back with surprising vigour, taking on BJP and its heavyweight campaigners, PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah.While BJP’s use of “national issues”, articulated by Modi and Shah, has been questioned in the light of the results, there is a school of thought in the party that its numbers might have dipped even more if the party had gone local.In Video: We will work for the people of Jharkhand: Hemant Soren"

PATNA: Results of the assembly polls in Jharkhand sent ripples through the political waters of Bihar, the parent state out of which the tribal-dominated region was carved out in 2000, capping a movement that had continued for close to a century.Lalu Prasad's RJD, once formidable but down in the dumps for some time, erupted in joy over the triumph of the JMM-led alliance, in which it is a minor partner, as it kindled hopes of replicating the success in Bihar where assembly elections are less than a year away.At the party's state headquarters on the Birchand Patel Marg, RJD workers began distributing sweets no sooner than the trends started pouring in and chanted slogans vowing to help Tejashwi Yadav their young chief ministerial candidate for Bihar, who had been actively involved in electioneering in Jharkhand to power.The party relished the thought of being a part of the winning combination in the adjoining state, even though its own strike rate was far from impressive - winning only one out of the seven seats it had contested.Shivanand Tiwary, RJD national vice president exuberantly said ""why not"" when asked by reporters if the party would like to join the new government in Jharkhand.He termed the victory as ""defeat of the BJP's jingoistic politics"" and questioned its ""duplicity"" on the matter of National Register for Citizens, ""which has put the country on the boil"".""The BJP's official twitter handle says it has country-wide implementation of NRC on its agenda. So does its president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah . But, Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday dismissed it as something off the radar. Why is the PM lying before the nation?"" Tiwary asked.The Congress - an alliance partner of the RJD both in Bihar and Jharkhand - was also buoyed by the poll outcome in the neighbouring state.Leader of the legislative party Sadanand Singh, who has headed the Bihar Congress in the past, advocated ""all non-BJP forces, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar "" to heed ""the need for coming together to defeat the BJP"".Kumar, who is running a coalition government with the BJP, has been drawing opposition flak after his party voted in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which allegedly discriminates against Muslims.He has, however, attempted damage control by asserting that he is opposed to NRC as its ""combo"" with CAA was what made the new law troublesome.The BJP, which has been on a roll for quite some time and a section of its leaders desirous of putting an end to playing second fiddle to Nitish Kumar, appeared chastened and sought to downplay its defeat in Jharkhand by attributing it to ""local factors"".""The result of Jharkhand must be viewed with reference to local factors and the agony of people because of unfulfilled individual grievances. The state government worked really well but failed to communicate well to the public. The party will assess the whole situation and scenario in coming days.""The Jharkhand result will have no impact on Bihar because the demography and geography is completely different in both the states,"" Bihar BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said here in a statement.The NDA government is working hard towards the development of Bihar, and ""we are sitting pretty well to win the 2020 assembly election comfortably"", he added."

KOLKATA: Stating that democracy in India is under threat from the BJP-led government at the Centre, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday wrote to chief ministers and senior leaders belonging to opposition parties urging to them to unite and chalk out a plan to ""save the country"".Banerjee described the current situation arising out of protests in the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed NRC as ""serious"" and urged all the non- BJP parties to come together and rise against the ""draconian regime"" of the central government.Sources in the ruling TMC, of which Banerjee is the supremo, said that the letter was sent to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah among others.Her appeal to the opposition parties came on a day when BJP working president J P Nadda held a rally in the city and accused TMC of ""misleading"" masses on the Citizenship Amendment Act.At the rally, held in support of CAA, Nadda claimed that Banerjee has always prioritized politics over national interests and pro people policies.""Today, I write this letter to you with grave worries in my mind. The citizens of this country irrespective of caste and creed, particularly the woman and children, farmers, workers and members of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, OBCs and minorities are in the grip of fear and panic for the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed nationwide NRC. The situation is very serious,"" Banerjee's letter said.""Today, more than ever, we need to rise against this draconian regime in the united manner. I sincerely and honestly request all my senior leaders and all the political outfits to stand up against this in a concerted and united manner; let us create peaceful and meaningful opposition to these unholy efforts by the Centre and save Indias democratic soul,"" she added.Referring to the police crackdown in Jamia Millia Islamia University, Banerjee said ""The youths and students have risen against and are facing the barbaric and brute force of the Centre. The entire world is watching us. Let us all rise to save India of your forefathers and founders.""Let us all meet and chalk out a concerted plan to protest and save our democracy,"" the letter, which was made available to the media, said.She said protests are already being organised by opposition parties wherever they have a meaningful presence.""I appeal to all of you that at this juncture, let us all work together. Opposition unity must be on one platform. The ruling party is bulldozing this democratic movement by using state machineries and brute force,"" her letter said.Banerjee, who has been a strident critic of the BJP and resolutely against the CAA and the proposed NRC, said that leaders of opposition or not being allowed to visit disturbed areas.A TMC delegation was stopped at the Lucknow airport when they attempted to visit Uttar Pradesh, the letter added."

NEW DELHI: With Jharkhand too slipping out of BJP, the saffron party seem to be losing its political foothold in the country. Till March 2018, the party dominated India's map. It along with its allies controlled 76 per cent of the country's area and over 69 per cent of its population. But in the last one and a half years, the BJP has lost big states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. And with the recent loss, the area under BJP has steeply fallen. It now controls merely 34.73 per cent of India's area and 42.5 per cent of its population. Here's a look:"

NEW DELHI: All eyes are on Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is scheduled to address a rally on Sunday at Delhi's historic Ramlila Maidan, which has a history of more than 125 years and has seen it all during different times.As history tells us, in 1883 the British started using this deserted place as a shelter for their troops for a long time. The troops set up tents where they could rest after long duty hours.Later after the British grip on power loosened, children used this place (the area between Turkman and Ajmeri gates) for their recreational activities. However, the troops shelter remained side by side.After the British left, the locals started using this place to enact Ramlila, that too during the daytime as there was no facility for electricity then.Recalling an anecdote, 95-year-old Bashir Ahmed told IANS: ""I remember one event in 1945 when Mohammad Ali Jinnah came here to address a gathering. When he was addressing the people, some people close to the stage sarted shouting 'Maulana Jinnah Zindabad'. Jinnah reacted sharply to this and lost his cool and asked the crowd to stop giving him such epithet. Jinnah said he is only a politician and not a 'maulavi'.After this, Ramlila ground frequently began to be used as a venue for mass protest rallies.According to Wajid Ali, a 90-year-old local resident, ""Syama Prasad Mookherjee also held a massive rally in the winter of 1952 on the issue of Jammu & Kashmir. It was from here Mookherjee launched ' satyagraha ' for a longer fight against the government.""Elders residing in the area shared more such anecdotes associated with the historic protest venue.""Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru used this venue to address huge rallies in 1950s (1956, 57). The venue was also used by Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan for the massive rally, mother of all rallies as it is called, in 1975 against the alleged autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi,"" said another local resident.Rukhsana and her 85-year-old brother Anwar, who have seen through the ages, said: ""On 26 January, 1963, Lata Mangeshkar sang the soul-stirring 'Aye mere watan ke logon' at this historic grounnd in presence of Nehru, which made people cry.""In 1965, after the war victory over Pakistan, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri addressed a rally and gave the slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan'.Indira Gandhi, in 1972, celebrated the war victory over Pakistan and creation of a separate nation of Bangladesh at this very ground. The crowd was so massive that it was difficult for the security forces to manage. Even the roofs of the nearby houses were filled with people to hear Indira Gandhi.The famous line of poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar that '' (Vacate the throne as public is coming) was oft repeated from this historic Ramlila Maidan.Not only this, Britain's Queen Elizebeth, in 1961, had also addressed people here.Anna Hazare and Ramdev also used this very ground for their protests against the government on the issue of corruption in recent times.However, it was Atal Bihari Vajpayee who used this venue more than any other leader.As Prime Minister Modi on Sunday addresses his rally here, the place is again to be used a venue to sound the bugle for Delhi Assembly elections slated for early next year."

JAIPUR: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not against Muslims of the country and they need not fear as it does not pose any danger to their citizenship, the spiritual head of Ajmer Dargah Zainul Abedin Ali Khan said on Thursday.He said the government should constitute a high-power committee considering the sentiments of muslim community and submit a factual report after hearing their grievances so that the fear and myths shrouding to the new law are cleared.""The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not against Muslims living in the country. Any muslim living in the country need not fear as there is no danger to their citizenship. But, there is a need to clarify the fear and myth spread among Muslims in the country,"" the Dargah Deewan said.Referring to the Delhi police crackdown on students of Jamia Millia Islamia , Abedin appealed to the Centre to issue a guideline to police to not use force on students and not act in a way as if the pupils of the university are criminals.He also appealed the students of the university to not take law in their hands as they are the future of the country and their parents and family have high hopes from them."

NEW DELHI: A party with a majority has the mandate to deliver a stable government but must also carry along “others” who did not vote for it, former President Pranab Mukherjee said while addressing the second edition of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture here on Monday.“The Indian electorate has time and again conveyed to the ruling party that goes on to form the government that yes, they may be entitled to form the government with majority of seats won by them but they are also to take into consideration all those people who may not have voted for them. The mandate is to govern as a majority party with a stable government, but carry others with you,” Mukherjee said. He said no party or leader had won a 51% majority since 1951.In comments that come in the wake of protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act, Mukherjee said an “overwhelming majority” in the legislature should not be an excuse to do “anything and everything”. “It is also to be noted that every time a government has behaved on the contrary, the voter has punished the incumbent in the elections that follow,” he said.“Unfortunately, this message of the Indian electorate has never been clearly understood by political players. That is why we think we can do anything and everything when we have an overwhelming majority in the legislature. But that should not be the case,” the former President added.Mukherjee remembered Vajpayee as a “strident yet reasoned voice” in the opposition, and a “consensus seeker while successfully heading the first coalition government for a full term” who “deftly managed to navigate issues in Kashmir, talks with Pakistan and the second nuclear test in Pokhran”.The former President also pitched for raising the number of Lok Sabha constituencies from the present 543 to 1,000 and for a corresponding increase in the Rajya Sabha's strength, arguing that India had a “disproportionately large size” of electorate for elected representatives."

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday urged every household in Jharkhand to contribute at least one brick and Rs 11 for construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, while addressing an election rally in Bagodar, which votes on Monday. The chief minister’s call comes a month after Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site.He said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was responsible for ushering in Ram Rajya . “In one sweep, the PM removed Article 370 in Kashmir. Today, you can go to Kashmir, Ladakh, Jammu, to the land of Ma Vaishno and Baba Amarnath and buy land. If someone has given you that right, it is PM Modi,” he said.He said after abrogation of Article 370, there was no loss of life, despite fear-mongering by Congress, RJD, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and CPI(ML).Commenting on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Yogi said India has never been biased towards anyone on the basis of caste or community, but the situation is the opposite in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “Minorities in these countries were thrashed and thrown out, their women exploited, their properties looted. They came to India looking for refuge and the government has granted them citizenship,” he said, adding opposition parties who were opposing this bill were speaking the language of Pakistan.“They are objecting to sheltering poor and harassed people and speaking in support of illegal immigrants who are looting your rights. Should we accept Pakistan’s language? Should these parties get your votes,” he asked, adding if someone has no respect for Ram, one cannot be friends with them,” he said.Seeking votes for BJP, Yogi Adityanath said parties like Congress, RJD, CPI(ML) and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha only worked for themselves. “They instigated terrorism and Naxalism. These parties were in power for decades after Independence, but could do nothing to help the poor and marginalised,” he said."

MUMBAI: BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Friday wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking immediate implementation of the ""historic"" amended Citizenship Act in Maharashtra He also urged Thackeray to clarify his government's position after Congress leader and minister Nitin Raut pitched against implementing the law in the state.""The Congress is opposed to the amended Act and we will not let it be implemented in Maharashtra ... I think Uddhav ji will completely cooperate with us,"" Raut had said earlier today.The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) was approved by the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha this week, and became an Act afteron Thursday night.The Act paves the way for granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who have migrated after facing religious persecution in their respective country.""As you are aware, the historic Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed by both the Houses of the Parliament. It should be immediately implemented in Maharashtra as well once it comes in effect in the rest of the country after the President gives assent to it,"" Shelar said in the letter sent to Uddhav Thackeray.Shelar, who represents the Bandra West assembly constituency, said the law is in the interest of the country.He condemned the Congress for opposing implementation of the law in the state and said its position on the issue has created confusion among the people of the state.The former Maharashtra minister also said the Congress is exhibiting ""arrogance"" by pitching against the implementation of the law.""Hence, you should clear the government's stand on the issue,"" Shelar demanded in the letter.Meanwhile, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said the Congress's view was contemptuous of the country's Constitution and challenges the rights of the Parliament.""This act is a historic step taken by the BJP to protect the human rights of those minority community members persecuted on religious ground in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.""Instead of supporting the step, the Congress is opposing it, which is shocking,"" Bhandari said in a statement. Shiv Sena attacks CentreThe Shiv Sena has attacked the Centre, saying it brought the new citizenship law to show it is the sole saviour of Hindus and asked what kind of politics it is playing by inviting uncalled for pain after the move caused violence in the northeastern states.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, which supported the bill in the Lok Sabha, but stayed away from voting on it in the Rajya Sabha, made the critical remarks in the editorial of its mouthpiece Saamana.The Article 370 of the Constitution, that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was revoked in August this year.Add to that, there is now violence in the northeastern states. What kind of politics the government is playing by inviting the uncalled for pain? asked the BJP's former ally which is now heading a three-party government in Maharashtra with the Congress and the NCP.After the Shiv Sena staged a walkout before voting on the bill in the Rajya Sabha, Union Home Amit Shah sought to know the reason for the party's overnight change in position on the legislation.Countering, the Shiv Sena alleged those who forgot what was discussed in a close-door meeting should not question what led to its change in the position on the CAB.The Sena was apparently referring to the BJP allegedly not keeping its word of sharing the chief ministerial post in Maharashtra on rotational basis -- an arrangement it has been claiming was discussed in a close-door meeting of top leaders of the two parties ahead of the October 21 Assembly polls.The Shiv Sena later snapped its ties with the BJP and formed government in the state with the help of the NCP and the Congress, its ideological opponents."

NEW DELHI: A day after Parliament approved the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, two non-BJP states — Punjab and Kerala — on Thursday vowed not to implement the legislation. This came even as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee called a meeting of her MPs and MLAs on December 20 to draw up Trinamool Congress’s strategy on CAB.“Terming the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) as a direct assault on India’s secular character, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said his government would not allow the legislation to be implemented in his state,” the CM’s office said in a statement.Singh said his government “would not let the legislation rip apart the secular fabric of the country, whose strength lies in its diversity.”Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the bill would not be implemented in Kerala, as hundreds of students of a college in in Kozhikode took out a protest rally and burnt copies of the bill and an effigy of Union home minister Amit Shah The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) too protested against the CAB.While asking people to oppose the bill, Vijayan claimed the law is a rejection of secularism and BJP had made it clear that its main political plank is communalism. “The Act is unconstitutional.. Citizenship Amendment Bill will have no place in Kerala and it will not be implemented in the state,” Vijayan said."

GUWAHATI: Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday stood up for the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) and various indigenous groups protesting against the, saying the spiral of violence since Tuesday was the handiwork of ""a negative force that has infiltrated groups of peaceful protesters"".""There is a negative force behind the violence; we are in the process of identifying this force,"" Sonowal, a former president of Aasu, told TOI. ""I know that vandalism and violence are not ingrained in the Aasu DNA. Neither Aasu nor any other indigenous group is involved in violence.""A police officer claimed that in almost every instance of arson in Guwahati over the past two days, the perpetrators were groups of men dressed in black and with their faces covered. ""These people join protest rallies in small numbers, about 20 to 30 of them in each group. They pose as peaceful protesters, shouting slogans and marching. As soon as they cross a police post, they turn violent and set fire to vehicles that they seem to have identified earlier,"" the officer said.Sources said the chief minister, who retains the home portfolio, carried out a police reshuffle on Thursday with a clear brief that those behind the violence must be isolated from peaceful protesters. At least three unnamed organisations are said to be under watch.""We will take all steps to ensure that lives and property are protected,"" Sonowal said. ""Additional forces are arriving from other states to back up our police.""Guwahati police commissioner Deepak Kumar is among the top officers who have been replaced.

BENGALURU: With a cabinet expansion on the anvil, some BJP MLAs made a beeline to Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's residence lobbying for a ministerial berth on Thursday.Though the MLAs maintained that they were not in the race, they said they were capable enough to take up the responsibility.Soon after winning 12 of 15 seats in the recent bypolls that helped the ruling BJP secure majority in the Assembly, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said cabinet expansion will be taken up and those disqualified MLAs, who made it to the assembly in the bypolls, will get preference.As the Chief Minister is likely to visit Delhi next week to discuss the cabinet expansion and allocation of portfolios,Vijayanagar MLA Anand Singh, Hukkeri MLA Umesh Katti and Yellapur MLA Shivaram Hebbar called on him at his residence.According to party sources, they pitched for a cabinet berth and discussed their choice of portfolio.Speaking to reporters after meeting Yediyurappa, Hebbar said he has been assured that he would be given a cabinet berth.""It has been left to the Chief Minister's discretion to decide who should be made minister and which portfolio to be allotted,"" Hebbar said.There were speculations that Katti was aspiring for the post of deputy chief minister.When asked about this, Katti said, in a lighter vein, ""I want to be either chief minister or a minister.I don't aspire for the post of deputy chief minister. It all depends on high command's decision,"" Katti said.""Being an eight-time MLA, I aspire for the post of Chief Minister. Earlier also I aspired for the post and continue to do so in future as well,"" he quipped.Bijapur MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal too said he was ready to take up any responsibility given to him by the party leadership though he made it clear that he is not an aspirant for the cabinet berth.According to party sources, cabinet rejig may be carried out besides cabinet expansion.Amid reports that the BJP high command is mulling over doing away with the post of deputy chief ministers, deputy chief minister Govind Karjol said he always stood by the party leadership's decision.""I will adhere to whatever decision the party leadership takes,"" Karjol told reporters at Kalaburagi."

MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar turned 79 on Thursday and scores of party leaders and workers from across Maharashtra thronged the city to greet him on his birthday.At a function held at the Y B Chavan Centre, Pawar asked the party's rank and file to work for the betterment of every person in the society.The event was attended by Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil, senior party leaders Chhagan Bhujbal, Praful Patel, Ajit Pawar, Dhananjay Munde , Shiv Sena leader and state minister Subhash Desai and others.""We are committed towards the betterment of the last person in the society...towards the youngsters. We should work for them,"" Pawar said at the event.The party handed over cheques worth Rs 80 lakh to Pawar and the fund will be used for facilitating education of the children of farmers who committed suicides.Pawar also said that Rs 50,000 would be deposited as assistance in the accounts of wives of the farmers who committed suicide.The Maratha strongman recalled that his and his mother's birthday fall on the same day, and she taught him to rise from failures while working in public life.Speaking at the event, Patil said Maharashtra runs on the ideology of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.""Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had shown what is self- pride to Delhi (apparent reference to Mughals). Now, Pawar Saheb has shown what is self-pride to Delhi (the central government),"" Patil said.Earlier in the day, NCP Lok Sabha member and Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule took to Twitter to extend good wishes to him.""Dear Baba, you are a constant source of energy for us. You gave us the bright legacy of ideology and also the strength to tread on it...Baba, boundless birthday greetings to you. Wishing you long healthy life,"" she tweeted in Marathi.NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik also posted a message on the micro-blogging site to wish Pawar.""Birthday greetings to the architect of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, president of Nationalist Congress Party Honourable Shri Sharadchandra Pawar Saheb,"" Malik tweeted.Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat also tweeted a message wishing good health and long life to Pawar.The NCP patriarch, born on December 12, 1940 at Baramati in Pune district, is credited for the party's return to power in the state along with the Congress and their new ally Shiv Sena by forming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government last month.The NCP was virtually staring at an existential crisis in the run-up to the Maharashtra Assembly polls, held in October this year, as several of its leaders jumped the ship to join the BJP and Shiv Sena.The Pawar-led party, however, won 54 seats - 13 more than its 2014 poll tally - in the elections and later went on to form government in the state after the Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP.The NCP has credited Pawar for playing a pivotal role in improving its tally of seats and formation of the MVA government."

In its design its grave implications, this flawed legislation is antithetical to the spirit of the freedom movement and violative of the soul of our nation,"" Sonia said in the statement.In the statement, she also reiterated Congress' determination to be relentless in its struggle against what she alleged was the BJP's ""dangerously divisive and polarising agenda""."

MUMBAI: A meeting on portfolio allocation among the three partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra ended on Tuesday evening with the issue of who gets the home and urban development ministries unresolved as both Shiv Sena and NCP have staked claim to the two departments. However, the other departments will be allocated on Wednesday or Thursday, a senior Congress leader said, with the two contentious ones remaining with CM Uddhav Thackeray until the issue is settled.According to the Congress leader, the agreement reached between the three parties is that revenue will be allotted to the Congress, finance and planning to the NCP and housing to the Sena. At Tuesday’s meeting between Uddhav, Congress’ Balasaheb Thorat and NCP’s Ajit Pawar, the three leaders were unable to reach a consensus owing to the claims to the home and UDD portfolios . However, Thackeray said that leaving aside the dispute around those two departments, a decision on the remaining departments could be taken, the Congress leader said.“Decision-making was delayed as both Sena and NCP staked claim to the home and urban development portfolios. As there was a lack of consensus, it was decided to take a decision on these portfolios at a later stage, while the remaining departments will be allotted on Wednesday or Thursday,” the leader saidAccording to the agreement so far, the Congress will get energy or industries, water resources or public works, medical education, labour and the woman and child welfare department. If water resources is not allotted to Congress, it will be given to NCP, along with public health, agriculture, cooperation and school education.If industries is allotted to Congress, Sena will get energy, transport, social justice, environment, higher and technical education and the MSRDC, along with public works if it is not allotted to the Congress, the leader said. The Aghadi government has been at the receiving end over its failure to allocate portfolios despite the CM having been sworn in a fortnight ago. Bureaucrats too have expressed displeasure over non-allocation of departments."

BENGALURU: Last May, BS Yediyurappa had to step down as chief minister within 56 hours of being sworn-in after Supreme Court gave him a day to prove his majority in the assembly. This July, he became chief minister after a dramatic vote count in which the JD(S)-Congress government collapsed after 17 MLAs of the ruling combine defected to BJP.Yediyurappa needed this big bypoll victory to legitimise his rule as in the last year and half it often looked as if he had lost his touch. The new spelling of his name (it was earlier Yeddyurappa) has obviously brought him good luck as BJP on Monday swept the polls winning 12 of the 15 seats. It must be particularly satisfying to him that it has resulted not only in the humbling of his rivals but also in the resignations of Siddharamaiah and Dinesh Gundurao from leadership roles in Congress. That the H D Deve Gowda family has drawn a blank in its heartland of Mandya must be particularly gratifying.The 76-year-old Lingayat strongman’s ‘Man of the Match’ performance has once for all quelled all rumours of the BJP leadership planning to ‘retire’ him. This strong performance strengthens him and he will now have a fairly free hand in running the state as the earlier appointment of three deputy CMs was seen as an attempt by the BJP high command to rein him in.It is widely believed that it was Yediyurappa’s promise to make the disqualified MLAs ministers after their victory that turned the tide for BJP. They worked extra zealously to return to the assembly as their entire political careers were at stake.Said political analyst M N Patil: “What remains to be seen is two things: One, how he handles them in the cabinet and how he handles the growing frustration among loyal party leaders and ministerial aspirants. The second aspect would be the most critical from now on.”"

BENGALURU: It was supposed to be retribution for betrayal as the Congress and the JD(S) tried to make a case against the disqualified MLAs, seeking punishment for their rebellion. Voters though rejected that argument and handsomely rewarded the turncoats.Reports suggest the two opposition parties are so shell-shocked, they are yet to come to terms with their defeat. However, many functionaries say their parties failed to convey the message effectively to voters.“They walked away with victory despite the fact that the BJP violated democratic principles by encouraging defections,” said former speaker KR Ramesh Kumar, who had disqualified 17 MLAs from the Congress and the JD(S) just before the fall of HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in July. “The defectors were opportunistic but we probably did not expose their true colours.”Thirteen disqualified MLAs, who paved way for the BJP to come to power through mass resignations, contested as saffron party candidates and 11 of them romped home. The Congress retained only two of the 12 seats it held, while the JD(S) lost all three.Factions within the Congress and the failure of the JD(S) to find a plausible narrative are among other factors responsible for the debacle. The BJP, on the other hand, was rewarded for its effective communication. Its star campaigner, chief minister BS Yediyurappa, convinced people that they were voting for stability of the government and the nightmare of coalition politics would return to haunt them if they delivered a fractured mandate.“A senior BJP leader had criticised our government and had termed it ‘intolerable’. As if to endorse him, enlightened voters from all 15 constituencies backed the ‘holy’ and ‘stable’ government. My hearty congratulations to them,” Kumaraswamy said in a sarcastic tweet.Yediyurappa’s promise that he would make disqualified MLAs ministers if they win also appears to have paid off since people voted as if they were choosing their ministers, not mere representatives of their constituencies. Voters apparently did not mind that their legislators had imposed an unwanted bypoll on them by defecting to the ruling party.“Our efforts brought an end to the coalition government that was formed unethically. People rewarded us for that effort,” said K Sudhakar, Congress disqualified MLA from Chikkaballapura who won on the BJP ticket.It is also evident from the sizeable margin of victory with which the disqualified MLAs were re-elected that their individual popularity among constituents helped the BJP sweep the bypolls.Byrathi Basavaraj for instance won by massive margin of over 63,000 votes in KR Puram, Bengaluru, while K Gopalaiah won by a margin of over 54,000 votes in Mahalakshmi Layout, Bengaluru. These are only a couple of instances of the popularity the rebels enjoyed in their respective constituencies."

MUMBAI: Leader of opposition and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis claimed on Saturday that it was NCP leader Ajit Pawar who approached him to form a government in Maharashtra.In a stunner amid deadlock in government formation in the state and while talks between non-BJP parties were at an advanced stage, Fadnavis and Pawar were sworn in as CM and deputy CM in a hush-hush ceremony early morning on November 23, the government lasting only 80 hours.Speaking to a news channel, Fadnavis said Ajit Pawar had assured him of support of all 54 NCP MLAs.""He made me talk to some MLAs who told me they wanted to go with the BJP. Ajit Pawar also told me he had discussed it with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar .""""Ajit Pawar approached us and said the NCP doesn't want to go with the Congress.

BENGALURU: The high turnout of voters for the bypolls, barring the four constituencies in Benglauru Urban, has triggered a debate on whether it will help or hinder the ruling BJP.The BJP insists the high turnout puts it in an advantageous position. Functionaries say people turned out in large numbers to ensure stability for the next three-and-half years. Equally, the Congress and the JD(S) feel the high turnout in rural constituencies is an indication of anti-incumbency against the BJP.The 15 seats which went to polls on Thursday registered an average 66% turnout as per reports from the Election Commission. That is 5% less than the average voter turnout of 71% in the 2018 assembly polls, the highest since 1952. But the percentage in 11 seats outside Bengaluru stood at 78%.The BJP, for which these elections are crucial, is seeing the higher voter turnout as a positive sign . “It appears that voters from all sections of society, including educated ones, have come to polling booths in huge numbers with a resolve to end the political uncertainty in the state,” rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa told TOI. “We think it will benefit us and there should not be any doubt about it.”Tourism minister CT Ravi echoed similar views, saying the high turnout indicates people want stability. On this count, he said, the BJP has the advantage.BJP says the high turnout in Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Hirekerur, Ranebennur and Vijayanagara constituencies will favour the BJP because of the BS Yediyurappa factor. “In these seats, Lingayats are a majority and obviously they want Yediyurappa to continue as CM,” a BJP functionary said.The Congress has adopted a cautious view. KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao said the numbers cannot be “deciphered”. “It is only when we get numbers from each booth, can we comment,” Rao said.However, a senior Congress functionary claimed the high turnout indicates underlying anger of voters against the disqualified MLAs. “As we observed during campaigning, there is a lot of anger against the disqualified MLAs and I think they have expressed it by voting in large numbers,” he said. He attributed the high turnout in constituencies in the Old Mysuru region to anger of the Vokkaliga community against the BJP for toppling the HD Kumaraswamy-led Congress-JD(S) coalition."

KOLKATA: In a veiled attack on the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said ""politics of divide and rule"" would do no good to the country, which is currently facing an economic slowdown.Speaking at a programme here, the TMC supremo asserted that it was time to address economic woes in the country, instead of harping on ""Hindu-Muslim"" issues.""Unemployment and poverty have reached sky-high levels. At a time like this, I don't know if harping on Hindu-Muslim issues will yield any positive result,"" she said.The chief minister urged people to work together for peace and prosperity.""Nobody knows what will happen to the banks tomorrow. There is uncertainty everywhere. This never happened before. Let us work together for peace, prosperity and unity. Dwelling on religious matters will not bring the desired outcome,"" she insisted.The TMC boss also claimed that industrialists in the country feel intimidated by central agencies - the CBI, the IT department and the ED.""Many of them have left Indian shores due to this (intimidation). Rahul Bajaj had the guts to speak out. But I feel he has been put under scanner since then,"" she said.Veteran industrialist Rahul Bajaj recently said that India Inc was afraid of criticising the Centre's policies. He found support in Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw who said the government treated India Inc as ""pariahs"" and doesn't want to hear any criticism of the economy.Slamming West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar over alleged delay in clearance of bills, she said there was a ""parallel administration running in the state"".""I am sorry to say this ... The House got adjourned as bills were not signed. We are fighting, and we will fight this out,"" she added."

MUMBAI: A day after he took over the reins of the state, the bureaucracy in Mantralaya was keen to hear what new CM Uddhav Thackeray had to say. At the end of a brief interaction with him, the bureaucrats felt that he was an accidental CM no doubt, but also that his thought process was clear, and he was careful but open to new ideas for providing a result-oriented administration.All along, the top babus had believed that Devendra Fadnavis would be back in power, and he did return, but only for a brief period. Subsequently, Thackeray was installed as CM, resulting in an uneasy calm in the bureaucracy. “Since Uddhav Thackeray is a Shiv Sena leader, there were misapprehensions about him and about how he would deal with the bureaucrats given the Shiv Sena’s style of functioning. However, after his first every meeting with IAS officers, he has been much appreciated,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI.Bureaucrats had a firsthand experience of Uddhav’s sense of humour when he observed that it was difficult for him to believe that he was CM of Maharashtra. “Is it real, have I become CM of Maharashtra? I can’t believe it,” Thackeray told the bureaucrats.Bureaucrats who have interacted with him since he took over said that he was friendly, forthcoming, informal and yet firm. “Thackeray has a charming personality, and his dress sense is impressive because he does not look like a traditional neta,” the senior bureaucrat said.Another bureaucrat said that during his interaction with Uddhav, he found that the new CM’s knowledge of several subjects was quite sound. “When he discussed the plight of farmers affected by unseasonal rain, he had complete information on the number of farmers, funds released so far and total funds required,” he said.Thackeray made it clear to the bureaucrats that since the government was using taxpayer money, all should be careful. “Our commitment is to the people of the state. Please ensure that when officials submit any file to the CM, it is a legal proposal, otherwise responsibility will be fixed on erring officials,” he said.Asked about the difference between Fadnavis and Thackeray, most bureaucrats felt it would be difficult to compare since the two had different qualities. “Thackeray is more forthcoming, and his mind is open. Fadnavis is a good listener. We worked with him for five years, but few bureaucrats were able to understand his mind,” he said. During the meeting on the agrarian crisis, Thackeray felt it was the responsibility of the department to bring in innovative ideas to alleviate concerns of farmers. In his introductory remarks, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said at the meeting that the bureaucracy was highly competent and professional and was committed to achieve the CM’s goals."

NEW DELHI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar asserted on Tuesday that an alliance with the Shiv Sena was ""not difficult"", compared to a tie-up with the BJP, and said his nephew Ajit Pawar had rebelled against the party as he was ""totally unhappy"" with the way the talks were going on with the Congress in Maharashtra Seen as the architect of the alliance between the avowedly secular Congress-NCP and the Shiv Sena, an aggressive proponent of Hindutva for decades, Pawar said there was ""perfect understanding"" among the ideologically diverse allies and expressed confidence that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government would complete its term.Speaking about his talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief told NDTV that he conveyed to the PM that it would not be possible for his party to work with the BJP.""For us, it was not difficult to work with the Sena as compared to the BJP. That was not the route we could have taken,"" he said.Asked about Ajit Pawar's decision to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), before a lack of support from NCP MLAs forced him to return to his party, the senior Pawar said, ""He (Ajit) came back from that discussion between us and the Congress and he was not very happy. He was totally unhappy. In that connection, he ultimately took that extreme decision.""In an early morning development on November 23, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn-in as the Maharashtra chief minister and Ajit Pawar as his deputy.""But he (Ajit) realised that it was not the correct decision and that is why he came early morning the next day, saw me and just withdrew from all this,"" Pawar said.He, however, added that his nephew had a sizeable following in the NCP, but declined to comment on whether Ajit Pawar would get the deputy chief minister's post in the new government in Maharashtra."

RANCHI: Setting a 2024 deadline for completing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the country, Union home minister and BJP president Amit Shah on Monday declared at poll rallies in Jharkhand that ""each and every infiltrator will be expelled before the next general elections"".Speaking at Chakradharpur and Baharagora, Shah trained his guns on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who was also in the state on Monday to campaign for his party. ""Rahul baba says, 'Don’t expel them. Where will they go, what will they eat?’ I want to ask him, are these immigrants his cousins? Let Rahul baba say whatever he wants to, I assure you the BJP government led by Narendra Modi will implement NRC across India, and all infiltrators will be thrown out before we come to you to seek votes the next time,"" he said, referring to the next Lok Sabha polls.Shah said national matters like uprooting terrorism and Naxalism, and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya were as important as local issues in the Jharkhand elections. Harping on the NDA government’s response to crossborder terrorism, he said, ""Many jawans from Jharkhand are involved in protecting our borders. During the 10 years of the UPA government, anyone from Pakistan could enter the country and trigger blasts. Our jawans were beheaded. Under the BJP government, we avenged Uri and Pulwama by entering Pakistan and destroying terror camps.""The BJP chief also raised the Article 370 and Ayodhya issues and accused Congress of deliberately keeping these pending for 70 years. ""Would you like to see a huge Ram temple built in Ayodhya?"" he asked at both the rallies, receiving huge applause. ""For 70 years, they sat on these issues just because of vote-bank politics. Modiji scrapped Article 370 and J&K became a part of the country forever,"" he said as crowds cheered.Targeting opposition parties, the home minister said JMM working president Hemant Soren had entered into an alliance with the Congress 'only to grab power’. ""The Congress was opposing the movement for a separate state when Guruji (JMM president Shibu Soren) was fighting for it. When the Congress was in power, it fired upon the students agitating for a separate state and attacked them with batons.

MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar has said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proposed ""working together"" but he rejected the offer.Pawar said he made it clear to Modi that it won't be possible for him to work together with the PM.""Modi had offered me to work together. I told him that our personal relations are very good and they will remain that way but it is not possible for me to work together,"" Pawar said in an interview to a Marathi TV channel on Monday.Pawar dismissed reports that Modi government offered to make him India's President. ""But there was an offer to make Supriya (Sule) a minister in the Modi-led cabinet,"" he added.Supriya Sule is Pawar's daughter and a Lok Sabha member from Baramati in Pune district.Pawar had met Modi in Delhi last month amid dramatic developments over government formation in Maharashtra.PM Modi has always praised Pawar and made it a point not to launch a vicious attack against him during the state election campaign.came last month when he was speaking on the occasion of the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha. PM Modi said other parties, including the BJP, should learn from the NCP on how to adhere to parliamentary norms.In 2016, when Modi visited the Vasantdada Sugar Institute in Pune on an invitation from Pawar, he had praised the NCP chief as an example to others in public life.""I have personal respect for Pawar. I was the Gujarat chief minister that time. He helped me walk by holding my finger. I feel proud to pronounce this publicly,"" PM Modi had said.Pawar also said not swearing in Ajit Pawar when Uddhav Thackeray took oath as CM on November 28 was a ""conscious decision"", prompted by the NCP leader's sudden support to Devendra Fadnavis, who became CM only to quit three day later after Ajit Pawar resigned as deputy CM.over a month after assembly poll results were declared on October 24.""When I came to know about Ajit's support (to Fadnavis), the first person I contacted was Thackeray. I told him what happened was not right and gave him confidence that I will crush this (Ajit's rebellion),"" Pawar said.""When all in NCP came to know my support was not there for Ajit's action, those five-ten (MLAs) who were with him, there was pressure on them,"" he said.The NCP chief said he is not aware if anyone in the (Pawar) family spoke (to Ajit Pawar to make him rethink his decision to back Fadnavis). ""But all in the family felt what Ajit did was wrong,"" he said.""I later told him what he did was unpardonable. That anybody (doing so) will have to bear the consequences and you are no exception,"" he said.""At the same time there is a big section (in NCP) which has 'asthaa' (faith) in him... He gets things done,"" Pawar said."

CHAKRADHARPUR/BAHARAGORA: BJP chief Amit Shah on Monday set a 2024 deadline for implementing the hugely divisive NRC across the country, asserting ""each and every"" infiltrator will be identified and expelled before the next general election.Notwithstanding the admission by some BJP leaders in West Bengal that apprehensions over the NRC had cost the party dearly in the recent bypolls there, the Union home minister told poll rallies in neighbouring Jharkhand that the nationwide exercise will be conducted despite reservations voiced by opposition parties.""Today, I want to tell you that before the 2024 polls the NRC will be conducted across the country and each and every infiltrator identified and expelled.""Rahul Baba (Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ) says don't expel them. Where will they go, what will they eat? But I assure you that before the country goes to polls in 2024 all illegal immigrants will be thrown out,"" Shah told election rallies in Chakradharpur and Baharagora.Shah said national issues like uprooting terrorism, naxalism and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya were as important in the Jharkhand elections as local matters like development.Raking up the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri mosque dispute once again, the BJP president alleged the Congress made attempts to thwart the hearing of the case in the Supreme Court.""Congress leaders would tell the Supreme Court that there is no need for hearing the Ram Janmabhoomi case. With your (people's) backing, we submitted that it be taken forward, and the result is that the apex court has ruled that only a Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya,"" he said.He also attacked the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance, which is crossing swords with the BJP for electoral laurel in Jharkhand.The BJP leader also gave credit to the state's BJP government for ""uprooting"" the Maoist menace and for bringing in development.""When Congress was in power, it fired upon students agitating for Jharkhand state and attacked them with batons. Now Hemant Soren (JMM leader) is sitting in the laps of the same Congress so he can become the chief minister,"" he said.Referring to the ""vikas ki Ganga"" flowing in Jharkhand because of the ""double engine"" growth the Centre and the state governments had ushered in together, Shah said the Modi government built AIIMS in Deoghar, and it will now construct an airport there and also in Bokaro, Dumka and Jamshedpur.About 20 lakh farmers have benefited from the crop insurance scheme, he said.Within five years, the Narendra Modi government and Raghubar Das dispensation uprooted naxalism and paved the way for the state's development, he said.He said Raghubar Das provided a ""zero corruption"" government and gave the state political stability. The Das government is the first in Jharkhand's history that will complete its full term in office.""Rahul Gandhi is in Jharkhand today. I challenge him to give an account of what Congress governments have done for Jharkhand during 55 years of their rule. We will also give an account of what we have done in five years,"" he said.Targeting the opposition alliance, the BJP chief said, ""Parties that sell poll tickets, exploit adivasis, had opposed creation of Jharkhand and indulged in corruption involving millions and billions of rupees cannot take the state forward.""In Video: 2024 deadline for NRC, all infiltrators to be expelled by then: Amit Shah"

MUMBAI: Amid the flutter caused byafter she removed her party's name from her Twitter bio, Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Monday said she was not leaving the party.Patil dismissed reports in a section of media which claimed that she may quit the BJP.In the October 21 state assembly elections, Pankaja Munde , who is the daughter of late party stalwart Gopinath Munde , lost to her cousin and NCP rival Dhananjay Munde in a bitter contest from Parli seat in Beed district.""The BJP leaders are in touch with Pankaja Munde. She is introspecting after her defeat but it does not mean she is leaving the BJP,"" Patil told reporters here.He also refuted Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut's claim that many leaders were keen on joining the Uddhav Thackeray-led party.""The accidental government that has come up in Maharashtra is spreading such baseless news. She may be having good family relations with Thackerays but it does not mean she is joining the Sena,"" Patil said.Pankaja Munde removed all details from her Twitter bio, including the word 'BJP' and description of her political journey, on Monday, a day after creating a flutter with her social media post on her ""future journey"" in view of changed political scenario in Maharashtra.Also, in her three recent tweets posted on November 28, she congratulated Maharashtra's new chief minister Uddhav Thackeray but not the government formed by the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.She was a minister in the earlier Devendra Fadnavis-led government.She remained present in all core committee meetings of the state BJP unit held before the formation of the new government led by Sena chief Thackeray.In her Facebook post on Sunday, she invited her followers to Gopinathgad on December 12 on the occasion of her late father's birth anniversary.Gopinathgad is a memorial of Gopinath Munde in Beed.""Looking at the changed political scenario in state, there is a need to think and decide the way ahead. I need time for some 8-10 days to communicate with myself. Our future journey need to be decided against the backdrop of current political changes,"" she wrote in her Facebook post in Marathi.""What to do next? Which path to be taken? What can we give to people? What is our strength? What are expectations of people?

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday expressed hope that Devendra Fadnavis , as leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra assembly, would not repeat the mistakes which he committed while being the state's chief minister.Attacking Fadnavis again over the hush-hush ceremony in which he was sworn in as chief minister on November 23 but had to quit 80 hours later, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said the BJP has lost a face having mass appeal.It claimed that people have drifted away from the BJP.""The current support that the BJP has (of its own MLAs and Independents) is unlikely to remain with the party. Whatever is happening to the party is the outcome of its previous deeds,"" the Sena said.Maharashtra BJP legislature party leader Fadnavis was on Sunday named leader of opposition (LoP) in the assembly.""Fadnavis should remember he has gone down in history as a person who was illegally sworn in by keeping everybody in the dark and without having majority,"" the Sena said.He was on that (chief minister's) post for only ""80 hours"". If he wants to get rid of that image, he should go by rules to work as leader of the opposition and take tuitions from senior BJP leader and former LoP Eknath Khadse, the Sena said in sarcastic remarks.""Fadnavis should maintain the dignity of the leader of opposition's post and not repeat the mistakes which he made earlier as chief minister of Maharashtra,"" it opined.The Marathi daily noted that the central BJP leadership decided to continue with Fadnavis as the party head in the Maharashtra Assembly, but did not follow the same in other states.""In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, BJP's Shivraj Singh Chouhan was the chief minister for many years, but when the party lost to the Congress, he was not made leader of the opposition in the MP Assembly,"" it pointed out.Similarly, Vasundhara Raje was also not made LoP in Rajasthan after the BJP lost elections in that state, it said.""But, what could be the secret behind Delhi backing Fadnavis despite the results (where BJP got 105 seats in 288- member Maharashtra Assembly)?"" the Sena wondered.It is now a fact that the Assembly polls' mandate was not for the BJP. Despite that, Delhi supported Fadnavis to take oath as chief minister (with the support of NCP's Ajit Pawar), but the government collapsed in three days, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.""And now the BJP made him leader of the opposition when people of the state voted for a change,"" it added.The Sena also took a dim view of the objections raised by Fadnavis during the Maha Vikas Aghadi government's floor test on Saturday.When the House assembled on Saturday, Fadnavis alleged the Assembly session was not being held as per constitutional norms. He also objected to the appointment of NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil as the pro-tem Speaker of the Assembly.The swearing-in of ministers of the Uddhav Thackeray- led government was also not done as per the constitutional norms, he alleged.However, Walse Patil rejected his claim, saying the session was being held as per Governor's nod.The BJPP MLAs walked out before head count began in the 288-member House.""The kind of drama Fadnavis did during the new government's floor test was not good. He made a ridiculous statement that he works as per rules. He should then explain under what rule he objected to the floor test on Saturday,"" the Marathi daily said.The Sena also said that the appointment of Congress leader Nana Patole as Speaker of the Assembly was a ""tight slap on the face of the BJP"".Patole had earlier quit the Congress and won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket. However, he returned to the Congress in December 2017 citing differences with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Fadnavis.""Patole was the first BJP Lok Sabha member who revolted against Prime Minister Modi, saying the latter does not allow party MPs to speak,"" the Sena claimed.He came back to the Congress and became Speaker of the Assembly. Now, Patole will decide whether Fadnavis should speak or not in the House, the Sena said in taunting remarks."

MUMBAI: Congress and NCP may have joined forces with Shiv Sena on the latter’s promise that it will commit to secularism, but just a day after clearing the floor test, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in the assembly that he would never abandon Hindutva.Addressing the special session of the House, the CM said, “I am still with the ideology of Hindutva which cannot be separated from me.” In contrast with Thackeray’s statement, the preamble of the Sena-NCP-Congress common minimum programme reads: “The alliance partners commit to uphold the secular values enshrined in the Constitution. On contentious issue of national importance as well as of state importance especially having repercussions/consequences on the secular fabric of the nation, the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress will take a joint view after holding consultations and arriving at a consensus.”The four-page document bears the signatures of Thackeray, NCP’s Jayant Patil and Congress’s Balasaheb Thorat.In reiterating his commitment to Hindutva, Thackeray also took a swipe at Devendra Fadnavis, hinting at that the latter didn’t keep his “promise” to Shiv Sena. “To keep a promise is also part of my Hindutva. I have been following my Hindutva yesterday, today and will continue to do so in future as well,” Thackeray said.The barb came against the backdrop of Fadnavis rejecting Thackeray’s claim after the assembly poll results that BJP had promised Sena a rotational chief ministership. Sena and BJP contested the October 21 polls together, but the saffron allies fell out bitterly over Sena’s demand for splitting the post of chief minister for equal terms. Of 288 seats, BJP won 105, Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44."

MUMBAI: Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ' haste to attain power and ""childish comments"" sank the BJP in Maharashtra and the latter became the opposition leader.With the coming together of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, what has happened in Maharashtra is acceptable to the country as well, Raut claimed in his column 'Rokhthok' in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana'.In a veiled attack on the central BJP leaders without naming anyone, he said Maharashtra did not bow down to the ""mob-rule"" like functioning of Delhi.What is significant is that Uddhav Thackeray came to power by dethroning the powerful ""Modi-Shah hold"", remarked Raut, who is the executive editor of 'Saamana'.He also expressed confidence that ""this government (of Sena-NCP-Congress alliance) will survive for five years.""""I find it amusing that the people who dubbed Ajit Pawar's tie-up with Fadnavis as a 'scripted' plan of Sharad Pawar, are now bowing before the NCP chief after formation of the (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government,"" Raut said.Ahead of the Assembly polls, Fadnavis made ""childish comments"" like there would be no opposition party left in the state, the era of Sharad Pawar was ending and Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi would be main opposition.""But he (Fadnavis) himself became the opposition leader,"" the Rajya Sabha member quipped.Fadnavis said he would come back, but his haste to attain power sank the BJP within 80 hours, he commented.""Over-confidence and his (Fadnavis') reliance on Delhi-based senior leaders destroyed his politics. The developments of last month look like a new script of the film 'Sinhasan' (throne),"" Raut said.He was referring to the 1979 Marathi film of the same name, which was loosely based on late author Arun Sadhu's novels 'Sinhasan' and 'Mumbai Dinank'.Raut further said the Maharashtra governor's office played the role of a ""villain"" in the 80-hour-long government of Fadnavis and NCP leader Ajit Pawar.""Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari once told me he would not do anything beyond the Constitution's framework. But he later administered oath to Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar in a haste. The order from the 'top' (apparently referring to the Centre) seems to have played a bigger role,"" he said.Ajit Pawar's ""desperate act"" (to support the BJP) brought the Sena, NCP and Congress closer and cemented their alliance, he said.It also created pressure on other NCP MLAs, who rebelled, and as everyone went back to Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar also returned, he said.""Had Sharad Pawar not taken the initiative, this alliance would not have materialised,"" Raut stated.Everyone in the Congress was doubtful of joining hands with the Shiv Sena. It was Sharad Pawar who told Sonia Gandhi that late Sena supremo Bal Thackeray had cordial relations with former prime minister Indira Gandhi, he said.The Sena did not field its candidates against the Congress in the state Assembly polls held after the Emergency in the country, Raut pointed out, adding that his party also supported the candidature of Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee for the President's post.""The Hindi-speaking community in Mumbai also votes for the Sena, hence the party continued to win elections of the city civic body. Sharad Pawar also informed this to Sonia Gandhi,"" the Sena leader added."

MUMBAI: The three-day old Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government headed by Uddhav Thackeray won the confidence motion in the legislative assembly 169-0 after BJP and its supporters staged a walkout on Saturday.Four MLAs abstained from voting, which was conducted as an open poll-members had to stand up and state their name if they wanted to vote for the motion.Before the vote, former CM Devendra Fadnavis of BJP questioned the legality of the assembly session, Friday's appointment of new pro tem speaker Dilip Walse Patil and even Thursday's oath-taking by ministers.As soon as business of the house kicked off, BJP members created a ruckus, alleging that the MVA swearing-in was unconstitutional as it was not in accordance with the prescribed format. Sena leaders raised slogans invoking Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, besides shouts of """". The opposition countered with """".Congress MLA Ashok Chavan moved the motion seeking the vote of confidence and was seconded by Sena's Sunil Prabhu and NCP's Nawab Malik and Jayant Patil.The motion had no trouble sailing through the house with 169 votes as BJP walked out in protest, questioning the validity of the session over the points raised by Fadnavis. The former CM also said BJP members had not received notice of the floor test before 1am.All the issues were dismissed by pro tem speaker Dilip Walse Patil. ""All the rules have been followed,"" Walse Patil said. ""This is not a new session but continues from the oath-taking on Wednesday as the house was not prorogued. The trust vote was conducted as per the SC order."" Walse Patil, however, refused to comment on the oath taken by chief minister Thackeray and ministers. ""It had happened outside the assembly house so I cannot comment over it as it is not in the purview of the house,"" the pro tem speaker said.MNS's Pramod Patil, MIM MLAs Mohammad Ismail Abdul Khalique and Farooq Shah, and CPM MLA Vinod Nikole neither voted in support of the MVA not against it. Khalique did congratulate Uddhav on becoming the CM and assured his cooperation.It was for the first time that Thackerays were in the house as members: Uddhav as chief minister and his son, Aaditya, as the elected member from Worli.Uddhav, wearing saffron headgear like all other Shiv Sena members, arrived in the assembly five minutes before start of business. He shook hands with all senior politicians seated in the first row and gave a hug to Fadnavis before walking to his seat. Aaditya was seated in the second row, just behind his father, while other ministers and senior politicians from his party, the Congress and NCP occupied the first row.Mallikarjun Kharge of Congress, MP Supriya Sule of NCP, former Union minister Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and other senior politicians viewed the proceedings from the gallery of the lower house.Sena functionaries Milind Narvekar and Harshal Pradhan were seen in the administrative officer's box of MVA.CM Thackeray, in his first address to the house as he replied to the motion, thanked all members and the people of the state. ""I was under pressure and reluctant as I was not aware and not experienced about the behaviour to be followed inside the house. After all, I am a man of the battleground. However, after coming across this system, I feel that my battleground is much better than this. I will not fight now as I am not a person who would fight with empty benches (opposition benches). I like to fight from the front. Unfortunately, they (BJP) are not an enemy but the political opposition,"" he said."

MUMBAI: NCP has emerged the biggest beneficiary in the negotiations within the Maha Vikas Aghadi for ministerial berths with a tally of 16. It will also get the deputy CM's job. Shiv Sena will have 15 members in the cabinet, including the CM. Congress settled for 12, besides the speaker's post.A Congress politician privy to the three-party negotiations said on Saturday that after the speaker's post was allotted to Congress, CM Uddhav Thackeray agreed to grant an additional berth to NCP from Sena's quota. ""The aim was to keep BJP out, but in the process Congress ended up being the biggest loser,"" he said. ""We were insisting on the deputy CM's and the speaker's posts, but now will have to be satisfied with only the speaker's post.""In the first meeting with senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel and AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge in New Delhi a fortnight ago, NCP and Shiv Sena agreed that Congress would get the Maharashtra assembly speaker's post and 12 ministerial berths, including that of a deputy CM.In a subsequent meeting, NCP objected to the proposal to create two posts of deputy CMs, as was being discussed at the time. Then, it was agreed that Congress would be given speaker's post provided it gave up its claim on deputy CM's post. For well over 15 days, there were several rounds of talks on the issue of two deputy CM posts - one each for Congress and NCP - while it was decided that speaker's post would go to Congress.On Thursday, Congress submitted to NCP and Shiv Sena that it was not keen on the speaker's post but would not give up its claim on deputy CM's post. ""NCP leaders led by Ajit Pawar made it clear that there will be no compromise and there will be only one deputy CM in the government, and the post will be for NCP,"" the Congress leader said. ""They said speaker's post will be given to Congress.""Congress was left with little option but to accept the speaker's post. "" When it was clear that there was no scope for compromise, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi approved the candidature of former MP Nanabhau Patole for speaker,"" the Congress leader said. Congress has to figure out how not to upset two former CMs Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan, who will need to be given posts of significance, in keeping with their standing."

MUMBAI: The NCP is yet to decide who from the party will be the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra , its state unit president Jayant Patil said on Saturday.The deputy chief minister's post has come the NCP's way as per the power-sharing formula in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government, while the Congress has got the Assembly Speaker's post.Patil's remark comes in the wake of the Congress also pitching for an additional deputy chief minister's post for itself even if that meant letting go the Assembly Speaker's post to the NCP.However, sources in the Congress said the party will have to remain content with the Speaker's post as there will now be only one deputy chief minister in the Thackeray government,""The deputy chief minister will be from the NCP. But Pawar Saheb will decide who will be hold that post. That decision is yet to be taken. Why are you in a hurry?"" Patil told reporters.Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar seconded Patil.""I will take whatever responsibility the party will give to me,"" Ajit said when asked if he would like to be the next deputy chief minister.Meanwhile, party sources said the deputy chief minister's post could go to Ajit Pawar. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister on Thursday alongwith two ministers each from the Sena, NCP and Congress."

RANCHI: At least 18 political leaders with significant clout in their respective constituencies have switched parties after being denied assembly poll tickets in Jharkhand - a record in the state's 19-year history.Putting behind their political ideologies, several leaders including three former state Congress chiefs have switched over to rival camps in the run-up to the polls.While Pradeep Kumar Balmachu joined the AJSU Party, which nominated him from Ghatshila seat, Sukhdeo Bhagat moved to the BJP and secured a ticket from Lohardaga . Another ex- Congress chief, Sarfaraz Ahmad, is contesting the polls from Gandey segment on a JMM ticket.Former BJP chief whip Radhakrishna Kishore took everyone by surprise when he joined the AJSU Party to contest the polls from Chhatarpur, which he had won in 2014.Terming the crossovers as ""politics of selfishness"", state Congress spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said, ""These leaders have betrayed common people. They are worse than chameleons. No morality, no principles, no ethics ... Their only objective is to get tickets to satisfy their lust for power.""His BJP counterpart Pratul Shahdeo said the saffron party maintained ""checks and balances"" before taking any leader in its fold and allotting tickets.""Our agenda is nationalism and development. And not all leaders have been given tickets. Former ministers Samresh Singh (who had his own party-Jharkhand Vananchal Congress) and Girinath Singh (ex-RJD member) joined the BJP, but were not given tickets.""Just coming to the party does not guarantee a ticket,"" Shahdeo emphasised.Among others who deserted their parties are ex-RJD MLA Janardhan Paswan, who secured the saffron party's nomination from Chatra seat, and JMM MLA Jai Prakash Bhai Patel, who is in the fray from Mandu on a BJP ticket.Former health minister and Independent MLA Bhanu Pratap Sahi has also joined the BJP to contest the polls on the party's ticket from his sitting constituency Bhawanathpur.JMM General Secretary Suprio Bhattacharya said the ""defectors lacked discipline and ideology"".""What matters to them is personal aspiration and not political ideology. The parties they have joined should think twice before nominating them for assembly polls,"" he said.Those that quit the saffron party, include former minister Baidnath Ram, who pocketed the JMM ticket from Latehar, and sitting MLAs Tala Marandi and Phoolchand Mandal.Marandi quit the saffron party a few days ago to join the AJSU party, which promptly gave him its ticket to contest from the Borio seat, while Mandal secured his JMM nomination from Sindri constituency.Kushwaha Shiv Pujan Mehta, who won the Hussainabad segment as a BSP candidate in 2014, is fighting from the seat on an AJSU Party ticket.Deosharan Bhagat, the chief spokesperson of AJSU Party, said leaders often gave in to pressure from their ""support base"" and switch sides.""This (switching parties) is against the country's democratic ideals. However, some of them take the plunge owing to pressure from their support base. It remains to be seen if will be able to enjoy the same clout having switched parties,"" he added.Meanwhile, around 11.02 per cent polling was recorded till 9am on Saturday in the first of the five-phase elections that began in 13 Jharkhand assembly constituencies.The voting commenced at 7am and will end at 3pm, Election Commission officials said."

PUNE: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said Pakistan was indulging in a ""proxy"" war as it had realised that it cannot win a ""conventional"" one.The path of the ""proxy"" war chosen by Pakistan would only lead to its defeat, he added.Singh was speaking at the passing out parade of the 137th course at National Defence Academy in Pune.Pakistan had realised right from 1948 through the wars in 1965, 1971 and 1999 that it could not win against India in any conventional or limited war, the minister said.""It has chosen a path of proxy war through terrorism and I can tell you with full responsibility that Pakistan will not get anything but defeat,"" he said.India always had cordial and friendly relations with other countries, Singh said, adding that the country never had any extra-territorial ambitions but if provoked, it would not spare anyone.""We are committed to the sovereignty and security of the people of the country. But if someone runs terror camps on their soil or is involved in an attack, we know how to give a befitting reply,"" he asserted.The Indian Army is not only capable of protecting the borders of the country, but is also capable of taking action across the borders, he said.""The 2016 surgical strike in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and airstrikes in Balakot in 2019 are examples of India's military capabilities,"" he said.Speaking about how terrorism has become a global threat, Singh said, ""We have seen attacks like 9/11 in the US and 26/11 Mumbai attacks. The Indian Army, CRPF and police forces have time and again foiled attacks by the enemy state.""Apart from terrorism, there is a need to tackle cyberwar and tactics that aim to spread ideology which is full of hatred, he added.The world has witnessed that the Indian Army showcases utmost professionalism during any humanitarian crisis or in the event of a threat to global peace, Singh said.Addressing the cadres, he said, ""When you become a part of the Indian defence system, you also resolve to safeguard the Indian Constitution. Resolving to protect the Constitution is a common thread that connects military leadership to civilian leadership.""Singh assured that apart from working on deployment, the government is also working on defence development and diplomacy.""Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, the government is emphasising on defence diplomacy and as a part of it, India has exposed Pakistan on all forums on the issue of terrorism and it (Pakistan) has been isolated at the global level,"" he said."

MUMBAI: So the remote control will still exist. It is from Matoshree-the five decades-old residence of the Thackeray family-that new chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will control the state's affairs. He isn't moving with family, bag and baggage, to Varsha, the CM's official residence at Malabar Hill , though he'll head there for key meetings and his office will be on the sixth floor of Mantralaya.It was in the late 1960s, when Uddhav was in school, that Bal Thackeray moved with his family to a plot in Kalanagar in Bandra East. The Shiv Sena was born in Thackeray's Ranade Road, Dadar, home on June 19, 1966, but it was the bungalow he built on the Bandra plot that emerged as a formidable power centre over the next few decades, drawing top political personalities, the creme de la creme of Bollywood, the best among Indian-and Pakistani-cricketers and, of course, a seemingly endless flow of Shiv Sainiks.In the late 1960s, the then Congress CM VP Naik, known as the Sena's patron-in-chief, had allotted land near the Mithi river in Bandra East for the setting up of a residential colony of artists, writers and others from the city and state's cultural sphere. Thackeray was allotted one of the plots as cartoonist and editor of Marmik weekly.Matoshree, as the Sena founder named the bungalow after his mother Ramabai, initially had a single storey but later grew three storeys tall. Thackeray's wife Meenatai planted the tulsi outside this home soon after the family moved in; when the bungalow was renovated in the mid-1990s, Thackeray made it clear the basil plant was ""not to be touched"".It was on Matoshree 's terrace that Thackeray famously sipped beer and chomped chana with his pal, Bollywood legend Dilip Kumar, before the actor angered the Tiger by accepting the Nishaan-e-Pakistan, the country's civilian award; it was in his ground-floor meeting room that Thackeray received the city's worried luminaries when they visited him in 1993 to urge him to call an end to communal violence following demolition of the Babri Masjid; it was here that an equally worried L K Advani arrived (as Union home minister) in 1999 to request the boss of angry Sainiks to rein them in after they had smashed the BCCI office at Churchgate to protest against the touring Pakistan cricket team; and it was the few steps leading up to its main door that an unlikely visitor, Javed Miandad, climbed one afternoon in 2005 for a chat with the ""Hindu Hriday Samrat"".Though the place was always special to Sainiks who trooped in day in and day out and made a beeline, especially on Guru Purnima every year to seek their 'Saheb's' blessings and pay obeisance to Meenatai who played the magnanimous, maternal host, Matoshree's clout was best underlined soon after Sena came to power in 1995, when Enron official Rebecca Mark made it a priority to see the owner of the house and made Sena CM Manohar Joshi-a stickler for timing-wait, impatient and fuming, in his CM's office in Mantralaya. Thackeray, with his cartoonist's outlook, also ensured its toilet made it to the national headlines after a certain Michael Jackson used it in 1996.After Bal Thackeray's death in 2012, the Sena's biggest concern has been the waning of Matoshree's influence. Uddhav was happy that BJP president Amit Shah came calling before this year's Lok Sabha elections to stitch up the saffron alliance, but none of the top BJP leaders lined up after the Vidhan Sabha results to make peace with him when he was publicly voicing his sense of ""betrayal"" over what he called the ""promised"" sharing of the CM's post.By choosing to stay on in Matoshree, thus, Uddhav is doing more than sticking to his comfort zone, where wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas are at hand to offer their support-as is Balasaheb's room where the son paid homage after being sworn in on Thursday. He's also sending out a message that Matoshree is still very much a place to reckon with-the good old Tiger's lair, unexpectedly now equipped with the CM's chair."

MUMBAI: After a colourful swearing-in ceremony and relatively calm first day in office, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray faces his first test, the confidence vote, on Saturday.The vote will take place under new pro tem speaker Dilip Walse Patil , the NCP veteran having replaced BJP's Kalidas Kolambkar in a sudden cabinet move on Friday.Saturday will also be the day nominations are filed for the speaker's election to be held on Sunday. The assembly is taking up the vote of confidence a day before the speaker's election and governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's address to the joint session of the legislature.The role of Dilip Walse Patil, an ex-assembly speaker, will be key in the confidence vote on the Aghadi government as he will decide whether there should be a voice vote or polling. ""If he is convinced that a majority of members are in favour of the motion, it can be passed without polling. However, if a majority asks for polling, he will have to put it to vote.""BJP was taken by surprise by the move to replace Kolambkar, who it had thought would preside over the special session for the trust vote.Sena has 56 MLAs, NCP 54, and Congress, 44. Another 12 from smaller parties and Independents supported the Aghadi when it staked claim. The pro tem speaker has a casting vote in case of a tie.In Video: Maharashtra: Maha Aghadi faces crucial floor test today"

BENGALURU: Senior Congress leader G Parameshwara on Friday hinted at the possibility of his party once again having an alliance with JD(S) if the ruling BJP failed to garner the required number of seats in the December 5 bypolls to remain in a majority.His remark comes days after the regional party patriarch H D Deve Gowda's cryptic remark in this regard sparked speculation.""After the bypolls, as we feel - if people don't elect the disqualified legislators, naturally BJP will lose majority and the government will fall.In such a situation both our parties (Congress and JDS) can form a government or President's Rule may be imposed and then mid-term polls may be announced, Parameshwara told reporters in Tumakuru.To a question on Deve Gowda's comments, he said there may be a possibility of Congress and JD(S) forming the government once again. ""This is what we have to understand from his statement.""""Two parties will have to form a government. Either JD(S) and BJP should form a government or JD(S) and Congress like in the past will have to form one, he added.Parameshwara, who is a former state Congress president, had functioned as the deputy chief minister in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government headed by H D Kumaraswamy.Gowda in a cryptic remark made in the context of the by-polls had recently said Congress President Sonia Gandhi's decision after the election should be watched out for, leading to speculation about the possible coming together of the two parties once again,if the situation arose.Gowdas son Kumaraswamy too had said there would be a stable government in the state after the bypolls, but not necessarily that of BJP.""Lets see what happens on December 9 (bypolls results date),"" he had said.The ruling BJP needs to win at least six seats in the bypolls to 15 constituencies to remain in a majority in the 224-member assembly, which would still have two vacant seats — Maski and R R Nagar.The Congress and JD(S),who had run a coalition government for 14 months and contested Lok Sabha polls in alliance, have parted ways after the collapse of the Kumaraswamy ministry in July, following the rebellion by 17 MLAs, and are contesting the bypolls independently.However, in what is perceived as JD(S)' softening stand on the BJP, Gowda — not wanting mid-term polls — had earlier said he wants the Yediyurappa-led government to complete its term as it would give him time to build his party.JD(S) had also run a coalition government with the BJP in 2006 and under a rotational chief ministership arrangement, Kumaraswamy had helmed the state for 20 months, before it collapsed.Among 15 constituencies going to the bypolls, 12 were held by Congress and three by JD(S),whose coalition government collapsed due to rebellion by the disqualified MLAs.With winning a majority of seats being crucial for the government's survival, BJP has fielded 13 of the 16 disqualified legislators who joined the party as its candidates from their respective constituencies."

CHENNAI: The DMK is likely to sign up poll strategist Prashant Kishor , who is working with West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , to help it script a successful formula for the 2021 assembly election.Sources said the DMK is looking at the option against the backdrop of Rajinikanth's imminent entry into politics, and the 'chatter' about the superstar and MNM leader Kamal Haasan coming together for the assembly poll.While chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Kamal and Rajinikanth are believed to have consulted him, Kishor may opt to work with DMK chief M K Stalin, sources said. ""The DMK's slender victory margin of 8,000 votes in the Vellore LS poll and its defeat in the Vikravandi and Nanguneri weigh on Stalin's mind,"" said a source. Kishor, who now heads Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) and is a member of Janata Dal (United), shot to fame after he strategized for Narendra Modi in the 2014 general elections, then as Citizens for Accountable Governance'. There were indications three months ago that all was not well in DMK's OMG, the party's strategy and tech team headed by K Sunil, a former colleague of Kishor.Earlier this week, DMK leaders confirmed that Sunil tendered his resignation. Party sources said Stalin was keen on retaining Sunil while trying to get Kishor on board. But Sunil chose to end his contract after working for Stalin.Stalin had hired Sunil at the end of 2014 after DMK’s disastrous performance in the Lok Sabha elections. The J Jayalalithaa juggernaut had swept the polls, winning 37 of the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu. Sunil worked with DMK for the 2016 assembly election and later left and rejoined Stalin for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the DMK won 38 of the 39 seats.""Political parties in TN now understand that brand building of politicians by poll strategists is essential in a changing political scenario that is now all about data science, technology and branding,"" said a poll strategist who did not want to be named. Kishor and Sunil co-founded CAG. The two later broke up and chose different paths. A 500-strong I-PAC contingent has been camping in Tamil Nadu to assess the ground reality, check the pulse of Tamil voters and prospects of the key players. Kishor had told TOI in August that if an opportunity presented itself - ""one that excites me"" - he would consider working in Tamil Nadu."

One evening in October 1966, a round-faced, portly man dressed in white plonked himself on one of the benches that draw a neat ring around Shivaji Park in central Mumbai. He was not out for fresh air, but for a ringside view of a rally organised by Shiv Sena , a new sons-of-the-soil outfit launched by a former cartoonist, Bal Thackeray . As Thackeray launched into a tirade against migrants flocking to Mumbai in his first speech, the man on the bench, Sharad Pawar, a Congress activist from Baramati, listened intently.Not that Pawar, who started out as a Youth Congress worker and looked up to YB Chavan as his icon, agreed with what Thackeray said. He stuck to his party's stand of ""unity in diversity,"" but knew the ex-cartoonist was not a man to be ignored. Pawar had, in fact, first met Bal Thackeray before the Sena was formed; Thackeray's father, Prabodhankar, was a public figure who routinely attracted visitors at his Dadar residence, and Bal had developed a reputation of his own with his brushstrokes. So an acquaintance was in place.After the inaugural Sena rally, the two travelled in different directions politically as the Sena-Congress bonhomie of the late 1960s and early 1970s - forged in their shared opposition to Communists in the city's mill heartland - ended. But a personal rapport endured, developing into a familial bond that has now enabled the late Sena founder's son Uddhav to take over the reins of the state with Pawar as mover of a three-party coalition.Bal Thackeray always referred to Pawar as ""Sharad babu"" in person, though in a clear separation between the personal and the political, he dubbed him a ""maidyacha pota"" (a sack of flour) in speeches. Their families dined together and looked after each other. When Pawar's daughter Supriya was barely a year old, the then Congress leader and his wife Pratibha once had dinner at the Thackerays' new home, after which Pawar said he'd drive back to his hometown in Pune district. Thackeray tried to dissuade him: it was late and Supriya was small, so he urged his ""dear friend"" to stay back and leave in the morning. Pawar however insisted on going, and by Thackeray's own admission, he was anxious and stayed awake until he'd confirmed over phone that the Pawars had reached safely.When Pawar, as NCP chief, decided to nominate Supriya to the Rajya Sabha in 2006, the Sena chief rang him up and told him he was annoyed because he'd heard the news from someone else. Pawar tried to explain that there was no way he could get Sena-BJP votes for her as they had their own candidates, but Thackeray persuaded BJP not to put up a saffron alliance candidate against her. ""I've known Supriya as a child, and she's played with my children since she was six months old. How could I not see to it that she enters the RS unopposed?"" Thackeray asked.Pawar played a key role in getting Sena to back Congress' Pratibha Patil and Pranab Mukherjee for President, and at the time of the Sena patriarch's final illness in 2012, it was Pawar who often gave Uddhav strength.This time, the barrier between personal and political has been breached, and Supriya Sule 's tweet on Thursday showed the extent of the warmth. ""Maa Saheb and Balasaheb -missing you so much today. Both of you should have been here today. They treated me with so much love and affection more than a daughter! Their role in my life will always be special and memorable!"" Supriya wrote."

Sena founder Bal Thackeray's son Uddhav assumed the top post as head of the newly minted Maha Vikas Aghadi of Sena, NCP and Congress at 6.40pm on Thursday at a grand ceremony at Shivaji Park , a location redolent with symbolism for Sena. It was here that the party held its first rally and where its first CM was sworn in more than two decades ago; Bal Thackeray was also cremated on this very ground.- two from each of the parties - were sworn in as ministers. From the Sena, close Uddhav aide Subhash Desai was sworn in along with Thane strongman Eknath Shinde. Both were ministers in the former BJP-led government.

""I take this oath after offering respects to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and in the memory of my parents Balasaheb and Meenatai Thackeray,"" he said. After his oath, Uddhav touched his forehead to the floor, as though to salute the crowd, in a gesture reminiscent of his father.Although Thackeray had extended an invitation to PM Narendra Modi , he skipped the function against the backdrop of the bitter split between BJP and Sena over the CM's post. However, former CM Devendra Fadnavis was present along with BJP leader Chandrakant Patil. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi stayed away.However, a battery of senior, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Kapil Sibal, Ahmed Patel, Abhishek Singhvi and Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath.

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray, sworn-in on Thursday as the 18th Chief Minister of Maharashtra, faces the biggest test of his life as the leader of an ideologically divergent alliance that took charge at a time of momentous political changes in the state.An ace photographer, he is the third Sena Chief Minister, after Manohar Joshi and Narayan Rane (both in 1990s), and the first member of the Thackeray family to hold the top post in the country's richest state.Thackeray, 59, otherwise considered an affable, mild- mannered politician, displayed combative traits of his father, Sena founder Bal Thackeray, in dealing with one-time senior ally BJP on the demand for rotational chief ministership just after assembly poll results were announced on October 24.He stood his ground and refused to budge on the issue of splitting the chief ministership, a stand that eventually led to the collapse of the three-decade old saffron alliance.After outmaneuvering the BJP, Thackeray will now have to prove his credentials as a leader who can navigate a new political path with ideologically different parties like the Congress and the NCP, partners in the Sena-led ruling coalition, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA).Though in politics for long, Thackeray has never contested an election or held a public post and it will be interesting to watch how he learns the ropes of governance in a state which is an economic powerhouse and home to the financial capital of the country.The Sena, a party identified with Hindutva politics and ""anti-Congressism"" since its inception, has entered a new phase where it will have to chart out a new course under Thackeray in the changed political scenario.Born on July 27, 1960 in Mumbai, Thackeray studied at Balmohan Vidyamandir and later graduated from the JJ School of Arts, where photography was his main subject.Besides being a published author, he is also a professional photographer whose work has appeared in various magazines and has been showcased at numerous exhibitions.Thackeray largely lived in the shadows of his legendary father before coming on his own after being appointed the Sena working president in January 2003.Thackeray formally took over as the chief of the Sena, founded in 1966 to fight for the rights of Marathi people, after his father died in 2012.Known for his passion for photography, he started out in the advertising field by setting up an agency called 'Chaurang'. Thackeray specialises in aerial and wildlife photography.He has two photo books to his credit, 'Maharashtra Desh' (2010) on the forts of the state, and 'Pahava Vitthal' (2011) on the Pandharpur wari (on pilgrimage to the temple town of Pandharpur).'Maharashtra Desh' is full of breathtaking aerial shots, providing a glimpse into the cultural fabric, physical beauty and historical perspective of this wondrous state.A few years ago, he organised an exhibition of his photographs and Rs 10 lakh collected from their sale was donated for farmer causes.Like former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who started out in politics by helping his mother Indira Gandhi, Thackeray began assisting his father at a time when the firebrand Sena patriarch was aging and the party's sphere was expanding.He focused on strengthening the organisation and encouraged cadres to take up issues of farmers in the suicide- prone districts of rural Maharashtra.Thackeray sought to make the Sena, known for street politics and aggressive stand on issues of public interest, more acceptable to people outside its core voter base.After completing his journey from 'Matoshree', the Thackeray home in suburban Bandra , to 'Varsha', the CM residence in south Mumbai, the Sena leader will have to reinvent himself, according to political observers.He will now have to display flexibility and political acumen to deal with new-found allies and keep the coalition government going for five years, they said.""Despite being in government, the three parties are independent entities and would want to expand their respective political base,"" the observers said.""A political affairs committee would be needed to identify constituencies where the Sena and the Congress-NCP are in direct contest with each other and prevail upon the local leadership to work out an arrangement where political base of the three parties remains unaffected,"" a senior Congress leader said.While Thackeray has shown political sagacity and maturity till now, he will also have to deal with an aggressive BJP in the opposition knowing very well the former ally will try to make functioning for his government difficult, the observers said.""Uddhav will have to keep his flock of MLAs together,"" they said.Over 20 years ago, Thackeray was seen as a 'reluctant' politician, living a cosy life with his wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya (now an MLA) and Tejas at 'Matoshree'.But now that he has taken plunge into governance and managing a disparate coalition, a slew of challenges await Thackeray, who will be one of the most closely watched politicians in the country in these media-driven times.Since the Sena leader is currently not a legislator, he will have to get elected either to the legislative assembly or the council within six months of taking oath.In Video: Uddhav Thackeray takes oath as Maharashtra chief minister"

NEW DELHI: Calling attention on the snooping scandal involving Israeli spyware Pegasus , senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Thursday alleged in the Rajya Sabha that top leaders of the government had full information about it.In a scathing attack, the veteran Congress leader said that the government had procured Pegasus as part of an organised plan and used it illegally.He alleged that home minister Amit Shah had a few months back met senior executives of Facebook which owns WhatsApp and discussed about Pegasus at length.""I demand that the government shares the minutes of the meeting in the House. The minutes prepared by both, government and Facebook, be shared so that the government does not mislead the House by editing it,"" Digvijaya Singh said.The Rajya Sabha member urged IT and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to share all the information related to the snooping scandal. He said the minister should not keep it secret citing national security.In case the government hid the information related to citizens' fundamental rights and privacy, the Congress MP said, a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) must be set up to investigate the issue.He termed the issue as sensitive and sought the support of political parties for forming the JPC.Digvijaya Singh posed some serious questions to the government and sought answers. He asked the government if WhatsApp had given the list of persons affected by the Pegasus spyware and if the government had data-sharing arrangement with messaging service firms like WhatsApp.He claimed that Pegasus cannot only be used for hacking of phones but also to plant videos, documents and messages."

BENGALURU: The BJP’s misadventure in Maharashtra could impact the party’s bypoll prospects in Karnataka , some saffron party leaders fear. Leaders say it could have a negative impact on voter sentiment, especially in the three constituencies of Belagavi — Gokak , Athani and Kagwad — where voters share a close connect with Maharashtra.“The drama in Maharashtra has proved the BJP is no different from any other party and that it will go to any extent to secure power. This has disappointed party supporters,” said a BJP functionary.The party is already under pressure to ensure victory of the 13 disqualified Congress and JD(S) MLAs — now their candidates — who are facing a backlash in their constituencies. The party is also riddled with internal rebellion over giving tickets to the rebels, ignoring party loyalists.The Congress though is upbeat with developments in Maharashtra. Congress leader and former MP VS Ugrappa feels it is a blessing in disguise for the party. “The way MLAs are being purchased and democratically installed governments are being toppled, people are fed up. I think these things will weigh on the minds of voters,” he said.But political analyst Harish Ramaswamy said Maharashtra’s politics will have no bearing on the bypolls. “The average voter is not bothered about what happened in Maharashtra or what is going to happen in other places. She will be more concerned about his constituency. So I don’t think it will have an impact,” Ramaswamy said.Meanwhile, in Mysuru, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda said the new alliance in Maharashtra will change political dynamics in the country. He said the Shiv Sena ’s, NCP and Congress combine will hopefully complete a full term and script a new chapter in Indian political discourse.The BJP-led government at the Centre has been taking unilateral decisions and misusing central investigating agencies like the I-T and ED to target the opposition leaders, he said. On the backdrop of such actions, the Maharashtra experiment gains importance.Gowda also hinted at major political changes in Karnataka after the bypolls but said it all depends on the moves Congress president Sonia Gandhi makes. “.. what happens after election results, the supreme leader is Sonia Gandhi, what she will decide everybody in the Congress has to accept. We have to see what happens after results are out,” Gowda said.He said although the JD(S) did not ally with the Congress for the bypolls, both have the common goal of defeating the defectors. The comment is significant since he had recently said the BS Yediyurappa-led government will complete its term."

MUMBAI: Close friends say he never loses cool during a crisis. Devendra Gangadharpant Fadnavis did display equanimity when addressing a presser in Mumbai on Tuesday after the BJP brass instructed him to resign as CM in the wake of Ajit Pawar 's somersault.As the presser drew to a close, a mediaperson wanted to know if Fadnavis' 'Mr Clean' image had been dented because he became CM for a second term scarcely for 78 hours. ""No way,"" he said. But a section of state BJP may find some merit in the question. A day after he stepped down, there were whispers in the city BJP headquarters that he ought to have handled the crisis with greater tact and sagacity. Some think he gave too long a rope to Sena in a bid to keep the saffron regime going and failed to pacify Uddhav Thackeray. Some said he ""deliberately"" denied nominations to cabinet colleagues. Others are of the view he shouldn't have joined hands with Ajit.Footage showing Fadnavis shaking hands with Ajit after the two were sworn last Saturday sent the mercury soaring in the RSS headquarters in Nagpur, it is learnt, as the Sangh looks at Fadnavis as a good “Swayamsevak” who treads with caution.But a BJP functionary said Fadnavis had kept party bigwigs in the loop during talks with Ajit. “The SC ruling thwarted Devendraji’s plan . It is futile to point an accusing finger at him,” he said. He further said the BJP high command will not hold any grudge against him. “Fadnavis has been a good CM. He diligently followed every instruction given to him by party bosses.”A party veteran said, “It would be unfair to call him the fall guy, though partymen need a sacrificial lamb after a defeat.”"

PUNE: All eyes were on Supriya Sule ascousin Ajit Pawar and Shiv Sena 's Aaditya Thackeray , and greeted Devendra Fadnavis and all the MLAs entering the hall to take oath at the special session of the Maharashtra legislative assembly in Mumbai on Wednesday.Sule has been occupying centrestage in the NCP with her father, Sharad Pawar, over the past few days after Ajit's short-lived rebellion last Saturday. She was all along with the senior Pawar during the hectic closed-door meetings with the Congress and Sena leaders at a Mumbai hotel. Then too, she had taken it upon herself to wait in the hotel lobby and greet the leaders on their arrival, even accompanying them right till the elevator and guiding them to the meeting room.Sule took the lead in organising the ""We 162"" gathering of MLAs of the Agahdi, on a day when the three parties staked claim to form the government. Simultaneously, she was also working to persuade Ajit to drop his rebellion.On Saturday, however, she was the first to confirm Ajit's rebellion through her WhatsApp status which read: 'Party and family splits'. She followed it up the next day with another emotional status: ""Who do you trust in life. Never felt so cheated in life. Defended him, loved him. Look what I get in return.""With Sule thus leading from the front, many felt that the internal dynamics within the NCP have changed and that she has emerged as the heir apparent to the senior Pawar. Speaking to reporters during his first press conference after Ajit's rebellion, Pawar had refuted the charge that Sule's growing clout may have acted as a trigger for Ajit's unrest. Supriya is a Rajya Sabha member and is not interested in state politics, Pawar had stressed.Senior NCP leaders with whom TOI spoke also asserted that the perception that Sule has emerged bigger than Ajit is not true. ""Ajit has a lot of clout among the party cadre. Yes, his rebellion may have failed, but that does not mean it has eroded his support base within the party,"" said one leader.Another NCP leader said, ""Remember, Ajit has vast administrative experience and a solid hold on the cooperative sector. The brother and sister are not in any kind of race, at least currently.""Among the string of 16 tweets that Sule released on Wednesday, along with pictures of the MLAs she had greeted, the one with Ajit was striking: ""Dada (Ajit) has been elected with highest number of votes. We, the 'brother and the sister', met before he took the oath. Let this meeting usher in joy for all of us."""

Though her remark was expunged from the record, it triggered a protest by opposition members.The moment occurred when Raja cited a statement of Godse on why he killed Mahatma Gandhi during a discussion on the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill and Thakur interrupted, remarking whether the MP will not offer the right examples while speaking on the subject of patriotism.Immediately, the opposition members protested while BJP MPs were seen asking her to sit down. Speaker Om Birla said he hasn't allowed her remark in Hindi to go on record. Later, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi, said her mic was not on. ""She made the objection when Udham Singh's name was being taken. She has explained this and told it to me personally,"" he said."

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray , chosen unanimously as leader of the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, will be sworn in as chief minister at Dadar's Shivaji Park at 6.40pm on Thursday. While initially there was talk that he would have two deputies - one each from the Congress and NCP - according to the formula worked out at a meeting of the front on Wednesday, there will be only one deputy CM, from NCP. Congress will get the post of speaker, but at the cost of its claim for the second deputy CM it had demanded.Along with Thackeray, NCP's Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, Congress' Balasaheb Thorat and Sena's Eknath Shinde , too, will be sworn in as cabinet members. Ajit Pawar and Patil are frontrunners for the deputy CM's post, though a final call will be taken by NCP president Sharad Pawar and Ajit may not be sworn in on Thursday. According to reports, notwithstanding the banner of revolt raised by Ajit, when he joined the Fadnavis-led government as the BJP leader's deputy last Saturday, a majority of NCP legislators on Wednesday demanded that he should be appointed deputy CM in the Aghadi government.According to senior NCP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Praful Patel, in addition to Thackeray, ""one or two legislators"" from Congress, NCP and Sena will be sworn in on Thursday. ""The event will be big, but the number of cabinet members being sworn in will be small. We propose to expand the cabinet after December 3,"" Patel said after the Aghadi meet.Senior NCP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Praful Patel confirmed the agreement reached at the meeting was that Congress would get the speaker's post, while the deputy CM and deputy speaker would be from NCP. ""All the posts, whether it is the CM, speaker, deputy CM or deputy speaker, will be for the entire term of five years,"" Patel added.According to a senior Congress leader, Thorat had proposed that the swearing-in ceremony should be small, with only one member of each party should be sworn in. However, NCP took the view that since the event was being organised at the iconic Shivaji Park, as many members should be inducted into the state cabinet as was possible at the function. NCP proposed that at least five members from each party should be inducted, but later the three parties reached a consensus on ""one or two members from each party"" being sworn in at Thursday's event.The Aghadi meeting on Wednesday was attended by Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, KC Venugopal, Thorat and Ashok Chavan, Sena leaders Thackeray, Subhash Desai and Eknath Shinde and NCP netas Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare.There was delay in taking decisions on crucial issues at the meet owing to differences over the number of members to be sworn in on Thursday, sources said. NCP, the sources pointed out, had expressed reservations on the appointment of former CM Prithviraj Chavan as the speaker and instead proposed the name of KC Padvi, also of Congress. But Congress took objection, saying that it was the internal matter of the party who it wanted to have as speaker and that NCP should have no objections over the nomination of Prithviraj Chavan. Praful Patel said a consensus had been reached on sharing of portfolios as well as state-run corporations and boards. ""Once the swearing-in is over, we will finalise all the nominations,"" he said.Besides Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil, NCP is likely to nominate Dilip Walse Patil, Hasan Mushriff, Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik, Rajesh Tope, Anil Deshmukh, Dhananjay Munde and Jeetendra Awhad for ministerial posts, while Congress is likely to nominate Ashok Chavan, Prithviraj Chavan, Vijay Wadettiwar, Satej Patil, Yashomati Thakur, KC Padvi, Vishwajeet Kadam, Sunil Kedar and Varsha Gaikwad.In Video: Preparations underway ahead of Uddhav Thackeray's swearing-in at Mumbai’s Shivaji Park"

MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray 's son Aaditya, the first elected representative from the Thackeray family, may act as the 'shadow CM' instead of being part of the cabinet led by his father, sources said.A Sena functionary said that two persons from the same family occupying cabinet berths could affect the image of the party, so Aaditya may not take up a cabinet position though he will be very much a part of the top team in the party and in the Sena-led government. Keeping Aaditya away from the cabinet could also be beneficial from the party point of view, the functionary said, as the 29-year-old Thackeray scion could facilitate talks and solve issues at the organisation level. He could also visit various districts to interact with the party cadre across the state, said the functionary.Aaditya was elected from the Worli constituency and took oath as a debutant legislator along with other MLAs at Vidhan Bhavan on Wednesday.Apart from Eknath Shinde, who will be sworn in today, contenders for ministerial posts from the Sena include MLAs Sanjay Rathod and Ashish Jaiswal from Vidarbha, Dada Bhuse and Tanaji Sawant from Marathwada, Gulabrao Patil and Dadaji Bhuse from North Maharashtra, Shambhuraj Desai and Prakash Abitkar from Western Maharashtra, Pratap Sarnaik (in addition to Shinde) from the Thane-Palghar belt.Other contenders are Anil Parab, Ravindra Waikar and Diwakar Raote from Mumbai.In Video: Will provide stable government to Maharashtra: Aaditya Thackeray"

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Pragya Thakur , whose controversial remark during a debate in Lok Sabha triggered a furore, claimed that she was referring to Udham Singh and not Nathuram Godse DMK leader A Raja was referring to a statement made by Godse during the discussion on the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha when Thakur interrupted him and made the remark.Speaking to ANI, Thakur later clarified that her remarks were meant for Udham Singh and not Godse.""This was not for Nathuram Godse. I interrupted him when he named Udham Singh. Then the Speaker asked me to sit down and I obeyed. However, A Raja continued his speech and spoke about Nathuram Godse in the same way. I did not interrupt him then,"" said ,Thakur while explaining the turn of the events.The DMK leader, however, claimed that Thakur had interrupted him while he made a reference to Godse's statement in which he had said that he had held grudge against Gandhi for 32 years before finally deciding to assassinate him.Raja had in said in the lower house that security should be based on threat perception and not because of political reasons while asking the Home Minister to revisit the Bill which seeks to withdraw SGP cover from persons other than Prime Minister.Thakur had courted controversy this year when she described Godse as a 'patriot' and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not made it clear that such statements would not be tolerated by the party."

NEW DELHI: Union Home minister Amit Shah informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi violated norms of Special Protection Group (SPG) 1,892 times since 2015.Replying on the SPG Amendment Bill 2019, Shah said that during the past five years, Rahul Gandhi did not inform SPG in 247 tours he conducted out of Delhi.On compromising highest security given by the government, Shah revealed that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi went on 99 foreign tours since 1991. Out of 99, she did not seek SPG cover on 78 such tours. Similarly, she violated SPG norms on 349 occasions since 2015.On Congress Interim President Sonia Gandhi, the home minister said that 600 times the party supremo did not inform about her visits to SPG officials.The home minister was of the view that the government has not withdrawn any security from the Gandhi family. ""The fact is that we have. We have also provided them ambulance and advance security liaison team all over India on the basis of present threat perception. However, when the Director Intelligence Bureau tried to communicate the change (in security) to Rahul Gandhi, the intelligence chief could not meet him,"" said Amit shah.On Shah's sensational revelation on Gandhi family's big compromise of SPG security cover, the Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary alleged that government is targeting Gandhi family and an attempt is being made by the Home minister to malign the image of Congress leaders.However, Shah told Adhir Ranjan that he never intended to reveal such information in the House but when opposition parties compelled him to reveal the truth, he was forced to provide the facts and figures relating to violation of SPG norms by the Gandhi family.In Video: SPG was made a status symbol: Amit Shah defends removal of Gandhi family’s elite protection cover"

MUMBAI: Maharashtra will have a chief minister from the Shiv Sena after 20 years, with party chief Uddhav Thackeray set to take oath of the top post at a public ceremony here on Thursday.Thackeray, 59, will be sworn in as the chief minister in an evening ceremony at the sprawling Shivaji Park, where his father and Sena founder Bal Thackeray addressed his famous Dussehra rallies.The last Sena man to occupy the CM's chair was Narayan Rane in 1999, after Manohar Joshi, who in 1995 became the first Sena CM.Thursday's swearing in ceremony follows days of dramatic political developments, which included a three-day government formed by unexpected support from NCP leader Ajit Pawar, who has since returned to the Sharad Pawar-led party fold.There is speculation that Ajit Pawar, who was present at a party meeting here on Wednesday after meeting the NCP chief on Tuesday night, may be inducted in the new cabinet.A special session of the 14th state Assembly was held here on Wednesday where oath was administered to 285 newly- elected members by pro tem Speaker Kalidas Kolambkar who was appointed to the post by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari Legislature secretary Rajendra Bhagwat said a decision on the date for Speaker's election will be taken after the Cabinet meeting, following the swearing-in of Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.NCP MP Supriya Sule greeted her party MLAs Ajit Pawar and Rohit Pawar at Vidhan Bhawan entrance.The newly-elected members could not take oath earlier even one month after the results of the Assembly polls were announced due to dramatic political developments in the state.The state remained under President's rule for 13 days between November 12 and 23 after no political party was able to form a government.The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked Koshyari to appoint a pro tem speaker and ensure all elected members of the House are sworn in on Wednesday itself by 5 pm.The BJP-led government, which was formed with the support of NCP leader Ajit Pawar on November 23, collapsed on Tuesday afternoon, after Pawar stepped down as deputy chief minister and Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister.The resignation of Fadnavis came a day after the Sena-led alliance paraded 162 MLAs in an unprecedented show of strength at a luxury hotel here Monday night indicating that the numbers were stacked heavily against the BJP.The alliance, which is expected to have a Common Minimum Programme(CMP), was stitched after hectic parleys involving Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.Once being the only second chief minister in Maharashtra to complete the full five-year term, Fadnavis now holds the dubious distinction of being the CM with the shortest tenure of four days in the last 59 years.The 'Maha Vikas Aghadi' comprising the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, has rallied behind Uddhav Thackeray, who is not a member of the state legislature.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed the BJP made ""barbaric attempts"" to retain power in Maharashtra but the state's people foiled it, marking the beginning of a change in the country's politics.Raut said it will not be surprising if the Shiv Sena forms government at the Centre after having installed its chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) in Maharashtra.Raut, who addressed the media regularly over the past one month as he took the BJP head-on, aggressively putting forth his party's side, also said that he would not be holding regular press briefings from Thursday and revert to his work pertaining to the Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana'.The Rajya Sabha member is also the executive editor of Marathi daily 'Saamana'.Asked who all will be invited for Thackeray's oath- taking ceremony on Thursday, he said, ""My responsibility will be lesser now. I will not speak to you (media) tomorrow onwards...I will start doing my original work in Saamana...all these decisions will be taken by the new chief minister.""Senior Congress leaders including Ahmed Patel met Sharad Pawar at his Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai on Wednesday to discuss issues pertaining to Maharashtra's ministerial council and oath-taking ceremony.Uddhav Thackeray along with wife Rashmi met Koshyari at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday.The Bombay High Court on Wednesday raised security concerns over the swearing-in ceremony of Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister at Shivaji Park, and said holding such events at a public ground should not become a regular feature.""We do not want to say anything about tomorrow's ceremony...we are only praying that nothing untoward happens,"" the court said while hearing a plea on whether the Shivaji Park was a playground or a recreation ground."

NEW DELHI: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said security of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul and Priyanka has not been withdrawn but changed to 'Z-plus' with ambulance.Replying to the debate on the SPG (Amendment) Bill, he asserted that the BJP does not carry out any action with a vindictive approach and it was the Congress which took many such decisions in the past.He said that the security cover has in fact been increased for the Gandhi family.""Impression is being created that the SPG Act is amended to withdrew security from the Gandhi family. This is not the fact. Security of the Gandhi family has not been withdrawn but changed to 'Z-plus' with advance security liaison and ambulance that will be given across the country,"" he said.The bill was passed amid a walkout by the Congress.Several opposition members also wanted changes in the bill which were defeated by voice votes.According to the amendment, the SPG will now protect the prime minister and members of his immediate family residing with him at his official residence.It will also provide security to former prime ministers and their immediate family members staying with them at the residence allotted for a period of five years from the date on which they cease to hold the office.In his reply, Shah also said when the SPG security cover was withdrawn from former prime ministers Chandra Shekhar , IK Gujral and Manmohan Singh , but no one uttered a word.The SPG amendment bill has been brought days after the government decided to withdraw the SPG security of the Gandhi family and replaced it with the 'Z-plus' security cover by the CRPF.The home minister said security is given to anyone on the basis of threat perception and there is no politics involved in it.""This government wants to provide security to every political party and is already providing the same. But political leaders can't be given equal security as provided to the prime minister of the country,"" he said.Shah said after 2015, Rahul Gandhi has in fact travelled 1,892 times in India and 247 times abroad without informing the SPG.""Members of the Gandhi family have travelled abroad on many occasions without informing the SPG. Instances like this has happened about 600 times."" he said.He said Sonia Gandhi had travelled 50 times in Delhi, 13 times in various parts of India and 29 times abroad without informing the SPG.Priyanka Gandhi had travelled 339 times in Delhi without taking the SPG cover, 64 times in different parts of the country and 94 times abroad, he said.Shah said the director of the Intelligence Bureau personally went to meet former prime minister Manmohan Singh and conveyed to him about withdrawing SPG cover and assured him that after threat assessment, there was no need for the SPG.""Manmohan Singh Ji himself asked Director IB to do what he feels is right. There's no point of not responding to his letter,"" he said.The home minister said the IB Director sought time from the members of the Gandhi family to inform them about the decision of withdrawal of SPG coverage but was told ""whatever you want to do, please go ahead"".Shah said post threat-assessment, protection was removed for family members of IK Gujral and Narasimha Rao among others.""No one made a noise... I want to assure that no security has been reduced. Instead, it has been increased. Why do you need the SPG cover,"" he asked.""Congress needs to learn to accept the people's mandate. They are not in power anymore,"" he said.He said the SPG is formed by jawans from the CRPF, the BSF and several other security agencies.""The SPG will not just care about the prime minister's physical security, but also cover his office, his health and communications among other things,"" Shah said.Without taking anyone's name, he said the person concerned used to go for late night bike ride in the capital at a speed of 100 km per hour.Replying to Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke the SPG protocol during Gujarat assembly polls when he took a seaplane ride from the Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad, Shah said the SPG assessed the seaplane and one SPG personnel accompanied the prime minister.Modi took that risk to promote tourism and not to enjoy unlike people driving motor cycle late night at 100 km per hour.Earlier, initiating the debate, Shah said the SPG was formed on the 1985 recommendations of the Birbal Nath committee and then a law was enacted in 1988.However, various amendments were brought in 1991, 1994, 1999 and 2003 which diluted its purpose, he said, adding that the government is working to make the SPG more efficient and to rule out any negligence.One of the amendments brought family members of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, which included Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka, under the SPG cover, he said.Participating in the debate, Manish Tewari (Congress) said that ""whenever such negative steps were taken, the country had to bear the brunt.""He said in spite of repeated threats, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was not given security.Inadequate security, he said, led to the former prime minister's assassination.""If the former prime minister was given security rising above bureaucracy then he would have been sitting with us in this house,"" Tewari said.Satya Pal Singh (BJP) said that SPG cover should be provided only to Prime Minister and not to anyone else.A Raja (DMK) claimed the amendment was being undertaken for political reasons.Security should be based on threat perception, he said, adding political leaders have been assassinated for political reasons. He also asked Shah to revisit the SPG (Amendment) Bill.Sudip Bandyopadhyay (Trinamool Congress) said that the government should review the CRPF security being provided to various persons including political leaders.He further said that while West Bengal Governor has CRPF security, the Chief Minister goes around like a common citizen.K G Madhav (YSRCP) and Rajiv Ranjan Singh (JD-U) said that security should not linked to social status but must be based on threat perception.P R Natarajan (CPI-M) said that law making should be undertaken to settle personal vendetta and urged the Home Minister to withdraw the Bill.In Video: SPG was made a status symbol: Amit Shah defends removal of Gandhi family’s elite protection cover"

MUMBAI (MAHARASHTRA): As Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is set to become chief minister of Maharashtra , party leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said that one shouldn't get surprised if his party comes to power in Delhi too.""I am saying this from the first day that we will form the government. I have said that our 'Suryaan' will land safely on the sixth floor of Mantralaya. But they everyone was laughing at us. But now our 'Suryayaan' has landed safely (maine kaha tha,'hamara surya yaan mantrale ke chhate manjil par safely land karega',tab sab hass rahe the. Lekin hamare surya yaan ka safe landing hogaya)"", Raut said.""People shouldn't be surprised if ""Suryayaan' Sena lands up in Delhi (aane wale samay mein agar ye surya yaan delhi mein bhi utre toh aapko aashcharya nahi hoga),"" he said.He said while referring 'Suryayaan' as a leader from his party.Responding to a question on Ajit Pawar, Raut said: ""The chief minister will take oath tomorrow. The role of Ajit Pawar is clear. When he took oath on Saturday as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, I said that he will return. I have also said that one would have to take 100 years to understand.""Fadnavis resigned as Maharashtra chief minister on Tuesday afternoon merely three days after he took oath in a controversial turn of events.Later, the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and staked claim to form the government in Maharashtra. Shiv Sena announced that Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as the chief minister of the state on November 28."

PUNE: ""Vastad sagle dav shikavto pan ek dav kayam rakhun thevto (a wrestling coach teaches his disciples all the tricks of the game but keeps that one trick to himself)."" This was the top post on 'Fakta Sharad Pawar Saheb', the Facebook page of Pawar's followers, on Tuesday. It came soon after Pawar's nephewthe Devendra Fadnavis government.What the senior Pawar achieved by overseeing the downfall of the three-day-old government in the state is not limited to establishing that he is the undisputed boss of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and that he has the ability toof the saffron parties. His winning, chess-like moves during the fluid political situation in the state gave him the opportunity to reclaim his credibility.He has been a rebel himself; it was a rebellion by him that dented his credibility early on in his political career when he became chief minister of the state at the age of 38. Now, it is the quelling of the rebellion by his nephew which may help him regain the ""trust factor"" that has been missing from his brand of politics. For many years now, Pawar has been dubbed the ""unpredictable politician"". ""When he says yes, he means no,"" his critics say.When Ajit took oath as deputy chief minister on Saturday morning, the suspicion that he may have done so on the directives of his uncle lingered throughout the day. This despite the senior Pawar tweeting that assuming office was Ajit's personal decision.Such has been the apprehension about the NCP chief that a senior Congress leader said that he had conveyed to the party high command his niggling doubt that Pawar would double-cross them. The Congress had, therefore, taken time to come on board with the NCP and Shiv Sena.The Congress politician cannot be blamed for harbouring doubts about Pawar. In his five-decade-long political career, Pawar has switched parties in the quest for power and, when needed, even amended his stand on issues.Pawar broke away from the Congress in 1999 while questioning Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin. But he joined hands with the same party later in a post-poll alliance and even gave public speeches justifying how, according to Indian tradition, a daughter-in-law becomes part of the family, irrespective of her origins. In the run-up to the 2014 assembly polls, he vehemently campaigned against the BJP, terming it a ""communal party"". But after the election results, he offered the BJP unconditional outside support, scuttling the Sena's chances of driving a hard bargain for ministerial berths in the government. This time around, he has cast the NCP's lot with the Sena, arguing that the need of the hour is to keep a ""non-secular"" party like the BJP away from power.Pawar has sometimes offered justifications for his moves and even his critics have occasionally endorsed his change in stance and strategy, but nothing has helped erase the ""unpredictability"" stamp on him. Late veteran journalist Govind Talwalkar, who witnessed the 1978 political coup by Pawar, had written in 'Maharashtra Times' a decade ago that Pawar did not backstab Vasantdada Patil as was made out by the media, including himself.He said the rebellion was enacted by Pawar after a green signal from Y B Chavan and that he (Talwalkar) was witness to the entire backroom drama. But coming 25 years later, Talwalkar's ""revelation"" did not help improve the perception about the political coup.This time around, Pawar has remained true to his word given to the Sena and the Congress. He was at the forefront of countering 'Operation Lotus' and was able to make his nephew fall in line. This may help him regain that elusive trust but it comes when the Maratha strongman is set to celebrate his 80th birthday next month (December 12) and after over 50 years in politics. And yet, there are several who still say they can't predict what he has up his sleeve next."

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: BJP's costly misjudgment of Ajit Pawar's promise to deliver the numbers has earned the party criticism, coming on top of an almost replica fiasco in Karnataka in 2018.In 2018, the Karnataka polls saw BJP fall short by seven MLAs and led to a bid to rope in opposition legislators, with B S Yediyurappa being sworn in as CM only to resign. In both cases, the Supreme Court ordered a floor test under the pro tem speaker, and the two (BSY and Devendra Fadnavis) resigned instead of seeking the trust vote. Coming just after the under-par performance in Maharashtra and Haryana and ahead of the tough Jharkhand match, questions will be asked about whether BJP was right in trusting Junior Pawar's claim that he had the numbers. Though Fadnavis said the plan was that of the state unit, the party brass is very much in the line of fire.BJP may have underestimated NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar, perhaps because the latter, who had in an ideology-agnostic manner offered unconditional support to BJP in 2014, did not come around this time. He gave a clear impression he was opposed to a deal with BJP after a bitterly-fought poll where he and Fadnavis had targeted each other.Internally, the leadership will argue it had to explore all means to avenge Sena's betrayal and to stop Maharashtra from falling into rivals' hands. And that sitting on the sidelines, even when Ajit appeared as a partner, while ally-turned-foe Sena walked off with the trophy, would also have made BJP a sorry sight.Yet the tactics, though they failed, reflect the thinking of the BJP brass to make a bold push for power even when numbers were dicey. The tactics failed in Karnataka in the first instance but worked in the longer run. In Maharashtra, the large gap between BJP's 105 to the majority mark of 145 will, however, make a change in assembly numbers more difficult.BJP sources say the party's initial plan was to accept the fallout of Sena's bickering and sit in the opposition. It felt the party would be the ultimate beneficiary as the three parties will run into inevitable difficulties in handling demands and conflicting interests in several regions of the state.Before he quit, Fadnavis said at a presser at the Sahyadri guest house: ""Ajit Pawar has submitted his resignation to me and now we don't have a majority. We are not into horse-trading. After this presser, I shall meet the governor and submit my resignation too."" Fadnavis said Ajit had cited personal reasons for his inability to continue with BJP. Ajit, he said, had extended support unconditionally and only he would be able to answer why he withdrew support.Fadnavis spoke of the sequence of events that led to BJP forming an alliance with Ajit, from Sena's first presser where it claimed ""other options were open"" to its demand for the CM's post for 2.5 years. ""The mandate was clearly for the Mahayuti but BJP secured the most seats, becoming the single largest party. Its strike rate of 70% was much better than Sena's 42%. It was clear the people's mandate was for BJP,"" he said.Seeing the numbers, Sena saw it as an opportunity and used it as a bargaining chip, he alleged. Even Amit Shah made it clear there had been no decision on sharing the CM's post, he added.Criticising Sena, Fadnavis said: ""We waited for them to hold discussions with us, but they who would not step outside Matoshree. They climbed several steps to hold discussions with Congress-NCP but not with us."" Sena, he said, has become so desperate for power that it has accepted the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, who is strongly opposed to the idea of Hindutva. ""The Sena is with Congress-NCP and no longer with us,"" he said.in the state because even Sena-NCP-Congress could not form government on account of ideological differences. ""How long should President's rule continue in a progressive state like Maharashtra? It was then that Ajit offered us support and we started discussions and formed the government,"" he said.On the manner in which the government was sworn in, Fadnavis claimed since President's rule was revoked, there could not be a vacuum as it could have led to a law and order situation, hence the early morning oath-taking.Asked if Ajit extending support to BJP was a strategy of Sharad Pawar, he said the question would need to be posed to Pawar himself."

BENGALURU: The bypolls in Karnataka are not being fought on political issues alone. A host of senior leaders across parties are freely invoking religion, community and sentiment.Caste politics was on full display in five constituencies — Gokak, Athani and Kagwad in Belagavi district and Hirekerur and Ranebennur in Haveri district — where chief minister BS Yediyurappa campaigned over the past few days. They are all Lingayat-dominated constituencies.Addressing rallies, Yediyurappa, a Lingayat, openly invoked religious sentiment, saying his future lies in the hands of the community. He also gave a clarion call to the community to back the BJP. His controversial statements have drawn flak from the opposition, who lodged a complaint with the Election Commission. Yediyurappa’s supporters believe that invoking religious sentiment will help the cause of the BJP.But it’s not BJP leaders alone. The JD(S), dubbed a Vokkaliga party, is also reportedly invoking sentiments of the community in KR Pete, Hunsur, Mahalakshmi Layout and Yeshwantpur constituencies, saying “Vokkaligara swabhimana” (Vokkaliga pride) is at stake.A fortnight ago, HD Kumaraswamy, former CM and the face of the JD(S), openly admitted that he was under extreme pressure to field a Vokkaliga in Mahalakshmi Layout, but he finally picked a Lingayat. While Kumaraswamy claimed it was to maintain his party’s secular credentials, political observers believe the party is trying to woo Lingayats in the constituency.“The caste factor cannot be negated in any election,” said one local BJP leader. “This time too, all parties are making concerted efforts to woo Vokkaliga and Lingayat [the two dominant communities] voters.”And caste may have the final say, trumping development and the issue of turncoats. In Ranebennur and Hunsur, where the Kuruba community is dominant, the Congress appears to be banking on its Ahinda ( Kannada acronym for backward castes, minorities and dalits) prowess.Legislature party leader Siddaramaiah’s stature in the Kuruba community is evident with even the BJP candidate from Hunsur and the former CM’s nemesis, AH Vishwanath, praising Siddaramaiah in order not to antagonise the community.The only exception, perhaps, is Shivajinagar, Bengaluru, where the battle is more on religious lines with the BJP fielding a Hindu and the two other parties banking on Muslim candidates."

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis of the BJPafter three days as chief minister, and by evening Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had expressed gratitude before a meeting of Mahavikas Aghadi legislators for having been given the chance to be the next head of government in the state.“I am grateful to the leaders of the NCP, Congress, Samajwadi Party, PWP and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana for joining hands with the Shiv Sena,” he said. “We were associated with the BJP, but it has betrayed us. Now, political parties which were against us for more than three decades have shown confidence in us. We are thankful to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, too, for extending support to the Shiv-Sena-led government. They have unanimously expressed confidence in my leadership.”Addressing the meeting of legislators, both NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Thackeray promised that they would provide a clean, transparent and result-oriented administration. They said their administration would satisfy all sections of society.Thackeray also launched a frontal attack against Fadnavis and accused him of misleading the public about the promise of chief ministership made by him and BJP president Amit Shah.“In my opinion, he is telling lies,” Thackeray said. “The BJP had given certain commitment to the Shiv Sena before the Lok Sabha polls and now after the assembly election he declared that no such assurance was given. Further, he alleged that the Shiv Sena has surrendered to Sonia Gandhi and these days Uddhav Thackeray is moving out for an alliance with the Congress and NCP. It’s all falsehood. I heard Fadnavis’s comments during the media briefing, I will reply to them at an appropriate time.”At the first meeting of the Mahavikas Aghadi, NCP state unit president Jayant Patil proposed the name of Thackeray as the chief minister. It was seconded by Congress state unit president Balasaheb Thorat. Immediately after the meeting, Patil, Shiv Sena politician Eknath Shinde and Thorat staked claim with the governor to form the next government.“We submitted to Raj Bhavan that Uddhav Thackeray has been elected as the leader of the aghadi and that he should be invited to for m the gover nment,” Thorat said.Thackeray said that as head of the Shiv Sena he very rarely visited the council hall but now he would need the blessings and cooperation of all sections to lead a three-party government.“We will not take revenge, but if someone is coming in our way, we will take him on. Our commitment is for providing a clean, result-oriented administration and a cultured Maharashtra,” Thackeray said.Thackeray also recalled father Bal Thackeray’s comment when Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule was contesting the Lok Sabha election for the first time from Baramati. At the time, the Shiv Sena had declared that it would not put up a candidate against her. “I will also have blessings of Sharad Pawar and all senior politicians,” he said.Sharad Pawar recalled his long association with Bal Thackeray. “We had differences on several occasions but it never had an adverse impact on personal relations. I always admired the qualities of Bal Thackeray. He was a different kind of leader. Had he been alive, he would have been the happiest person to see his son sworn in as the CM of Maharahstra,” he said.Paying glowing tributes to Bal Thackeray, Pawar said he was one politician who gave an opportunity to the poorest of the poor. “I still remember how he nominated Aurangabad leader Chandrakant Khaire to contest the Lok Sabha election. A man with no political background, Khaire was elected to the Lok Sabha for five consecutive terms. I am sure, like his father, Uddhav will also be just to people from all walks of life,” Pawar said."

MUMBAI: Over a month after the state assembly results were declared, Maharshtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has called for a special session of the legislative assembly on Wednesday, which will begin at 8am, to administer oath to the 288 newly elected members of the assembly.On Tuesday, the governor appointed Kalidas Kolambkar, BJP MLA from Wadala, as the pro tem speaker. He is the senior-most MLA who has won the assembly elections for eight consecutive terms.Sources said that with the Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP alliance staking claim to form the government late on Tuesday, it is likely that a show of strength of the combine's MLAs will be seen inside Vidhan Bhavan premises.Kolambkar was appointed on the directions of the Supreme Court, which ordered a floor test on Wednesday.The apex court ordered a floor test for the Devendra Fadnavis government , and asked the governor to appoint a pro tem speaker and ensure that all elected members of the House are sworn-in by 5pm on Wednesday itself.""Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has called a special session of the legislative assembly on Wednesday. The session would begin at 8am for the oath-taking ceremony of the 288 members,"" said the official. Congress legislators Balasaheb Thorat and KC Padvi had also been shortlisted for the post.The tenure of the previous Vidhan Sabha lapsed on November 9 and in the absence of any party to form a government due to lack of a majority, the state remained under President's rule for a period of 13 days between November 12 and November 23.""We are happy that the political crisis in the state has come to an end. It was a month since we were elected but not sworn in. People from our constituencies were coming to us with their problems but we had no authority to take any action. Now we can start working in our constituencies,"" said a first-time MLA from Vidarbha.Among the newly elected legislators who will take oath on Wedneday are Yuva Sena leader and Uddhav Thackeray's son Aaditya Thackeray, NCP leader Sunil Tatkare's daughter, Aditi Tatkare, and Congress functionary Baba Siddiqui's son Zeeshan Siddiqui."

PUNE/MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: A morning meeting between uncle and nephew at a Mumbai hotel on Tuesday put the Sena-NCP-Congress combine back on course to form the government in Maharashtra Hours later, the nephew, Ajit Pawar , submitted his resignation to BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis , who stepped down as chief minister in the afternoon. By evening, the Maha Vikas Aghadi officially named Sena president Uddhav Thackeray for the top job.""He (Ajit) met 'saheb' (Sharad Pawar) in the morning following which the developments took place. I don't exactly know what triggered him (sic). I was myself unaware and everything was decided between him and saheb,"" Ajit Pawar's son Parth told TOI.Ajit's sudden rebellion had shaken the close-knit Pawar family, but they were told that Sharad Pawar would deal with the matter directly, said a family friend. Only Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule and grandnephew Rohit made emotional appeals on social media.Sources indicated that Pawar's wife Pratibha was keen on a reconciliation with Ajit.In September, when Ajit quit as MLA in the wake of the ED case against him, Pawar had dismissed talk of the resignation being the result of a family dispute. ""There is no political or family dispute. Our family has a tradition of sitting down and deciding everything. I am the family head, my word is final,"" he had said.Over the past couple of days, Pawar sent delegation after delegation of senior NCP leaders to meet Ajit and mount pressure on him against making any move that would hurt the party. They tried to convince him that his decision to ally with BJP was not in his own interests. ""We had a prolonged meeting with Ajit. We told him to reconsider and return to the party fold. He assured us that he would apply his mind. Three hours later, he resigned,'' senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal told TOI.Sunil Tatkare and Hasan Mushriff were the first NCP leaders to meet Ajit after he was sworn in as deputy chief minister on November 23. This was followed by another meeting with Tatkare and state NCP chief Jayant Patil on Monday. However, with Ajit taking a firm stand, the NCP leaders had given up hope that he would return to the party.On Tuesday, Praful Patel convinced Ajit to meet senior NCP leaders once again at his residence. At the meeting NCP leaders told Ajit that his decision to join hands with Fadnavis had embarrassed Sharad Pawar and the entire Pawar family. Soon after this meeting, Ajit met senior Pawar at the hotel.Having virtually run the party after his uncle settled into the ""elder"" role, Ajit has a good grip on the organisation and is popular among party MLAs. The issues he had raised before his rebellion - that Sena should concede rotational CM considering that it had just two more MLAs than NCP; that Congress was seeking an inordinate share; and that NCP along with BJP could provide a stable regime than a three-party Aghadi - found resonance among the ranks.However, things did not go his way due to a combination of factors. First, he did not expect his uncle to put up the kind of resistance he showed. Senior Pawar was opposed to signing a deal with BJP immediately after a poll in which he and Fadnavis had targeted each other.Second, many NCP MLAs had won against heavy odds and did not wish to take risks such as disqualification. Third, the reverence for Pawar trumped their loyalty to Ajit. And, fourth, the emotional appeal from within the family and pleas for reconsideration by sympathetic colleagues not to split the party deterred him. It also shows that BJP did not act on a lark when it decided to team up with Ajit. The party had banked on his fabled goodwill among the ranks, but he failed to deliver."

MUMBAI: Uddhav Thackeray will be chief minister of Maharashtra as the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi of Shiv Sena , NCP and Congress is all set to form its government after, in yet another unexpected turn in the state's relentless post-poll political drama, CM Devendra Fadnavis and deputy CM Ajit Pawar handed in their resignation letters to governor B S Koshyari on Tuesday.The resignation of Ajit Pawar at 2.30pm, followed by that of Fadnavis, made it the most short-lived government in Maharashtra, having survived for just 80 hours after the swearing-in of the top two leaders at 8am on Saturday. It also rendered unnecessary the floor test mandated by the Supreme Court on Wednesday, though the session of the state assembly will begin on Wednesday with all the MLAs taking oath.At a meeting of the newly minted three-party coalition in the evening at a hotel in Nariman Point, Uddhav Thackeray was unanimously elected leader of the Aghadi, paving the way for his anointment as CM. After the meet, Eknath Shinde of Sena, Jayant Patil of NCP and Balasaheb Thorat of Congress headed to Raj Bhavan at 9pm to stake claim. Thorat and Patil are frontrunners to be Uddhav's deputies.Uddhav, 59, will be the first member of the Thackeray family to be the state's CM. He will be sworn in as CM at Shivaji Park (as the Sena had earlier declared) at 6.40pm on Thursday, the Aghadi's prime mover-in-chief and NCP president Sharad Pawar said at the meeting.Fadnavis said BJP did not have the numbers after Ajit Pawar submitted his resignation. Ajit Pawar, who had promised numbers to BJP so that it could reach the majority mark of 145 in the 288-member House, resigned saying he was not in a position to continue with the government.The Supreme Court order in the morning set the tone for the day's developments with Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis giving up their posts. The Supreme Court ordered the Fadnavis government to prove its majority before 5pm on Wednesday in a televised show of strength, with the pro tem speaker presiding over the floor test.The resolution appointing Uddhav as Aghadi neta was moved in the evening by NCP's Jayant Patil, who said ""Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray will be the front's leader"". Thanking ""Soniaji along with all the others"", Uddhav said in his address to leaders and legislators of the three parties that he remembered his father Balasaheb on this occasion and added that the threeparty coalition of parties with disparate ideologies would give a new direction to India. ""I will also go to meet my motha bhau (elder brother) after we have formed the government,"" Uddhav said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comment in the poll campaign that the Sena president was his younger brother. Uddhav also said his would not be a vindictive government but one that secures the people's interests.Uddhav is not a legislator, so he will have to be elected to the legislative assembly or council within six months. His son Aaditya Thackeraywas elected from Worli this time, which means the father-son duo will be in the state legislature together."

MUMBAI: When Sharad Pawar addressed a rain-soaked rally in Maharashtra's Satara during campaigning for the October 21 Assembly polls, few thought that the 79- year-old would be the driving force behind the new government.With the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress all set to assume power in Maharashtra, the patriarch of this unlikely anti-BJP combine is the one left smiling, having outwitted stalwarts from the BJP camp.Having brought his party out of a virtual existential crisis ahead of the Assembly polls, Pawar's efforts suffered a setback, albeit momentarily, when nephew Ajit Pawar shocked him by aligning with the BJP to form the government.That regime lasted just 80 hours, before Ajit quit as deputy CM citing personal reasons, leaving Devendra Fadnavis , into his second stint as the CM high and dry. Within hours, Fadnavis also quit, paving way for the non-BJP combine to assume reins of the state.With the NCP hit by multiple desertions ahead of the Maharashtra polls, Sharad Pawar assumed charge of the campaign and traversed the state. His efforts paid off, with the party winning 54 seats, 13 more than its 2014 tally in the 288- member House.A dauntless Pawar was instrumental in stitching the unlikely alliance with rival Shiv Sena to form a government in the state to keep the BJP away from power.Pawar has been a defence minister, opposition leader in the Lok Sabha and three-time Maharashtra chief minister in a career spanning 52 years in electoral politics.He was a member of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and the Lok Sabha for seven times each.At 27 he was already a legislator in the Maharashtra Assembly, and at 38 he managed to pull down the Congress government in the state.Pawar shot to fame in 1978 when he dislodged the then Vasantdada Patil dispensation in the state to form a government with the Janata Party. He was only 38 at the time and is Maharashtra's youngest chief minister till date.He went on to become chief minister of the state two more times, from June 1988 to June 1991 and from March 1993 to March 1995.Pawar served as defence minister from June 1991 to March 1993.He parted ways with the Congress in 1999 over party president Sonia Gandhi 's foreign origin issue and formed the NCP the same year. The Congress and NCP came together after the 1999 Assembly election in Maharashtra to form government in the state.Pawar became Agriculture minister in the Manmohan Singh government 2004 and served in that capacity over the next 10 years.A powerful minister in the Manmohan Singh government, he derives much power from his sugar-exporting constituency in Pune district.He is one of the few politicians to enjoy support from parties across regions and ideologies.Often accused by his rivals of encouraging dynastic politics, Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule is a three-time MP from Baramati, the NCP's stronghold.Pawar's grand nephew Rohit got elected from the Karjat-Jamkhed seat.Apart from politics, Pawar has been associated with cricket bodies including the International Cricket Council and Maharashtra State Wrestling Association."

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be the first member of the Thackeray family to become Maharashtra chief minister.Uddhav is set to lead the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress alliance government, called Maha Vikas Aghadi, in Maharashtra.This is also the first time that the Shiv Sena, a regional party founded in 1966 by Uddhav's father Balasaheb Thackeray, is joining hands with the Congress and the NCP.After he becomes chief minister, Uddhav will have to seek election to the Maharashtra Assembly or the Legislative Council within six months.Uddhav has never contested an election and is not a member of either of the House of the state legislature.His son Aaditya became the first member of the Thackeray family to contest an election when he won from the Worli assembly constituency last month.Uddhav may choose to contest an election after getting one of the party's MLAs to resign. His son Aaditya could also resign from the Worli seat to pave way for his father.In the assembly elections, the BJP won 105 seats and Shiv Sena 56, while the Congress-NCP combine won 98 seats in the 288-member assembly.Uddhhav, born on July 27, 1960, took charge of the party after his father passed away in 2012.He started his political journey when he began handling the daily business of the Shiv Sena's mouthpiece Saamna.He openly criticised the administrative skills and working style of Narayan Rane , who was the Sena chief minister of Maharashtra in 1999 and his spat led to Rane's resignation. Rane was expelled from the party as well.Uddhav led the Shiv Sena to a massive victory in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections in 2002.In 2003, he was made the party working president. After a fallout between him and his cousin brother Raj Thackeray in 2006, the latter went on to form the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena Uddhav's son, Aaditya, is president of the Yuva Sena"

MUMBAI: In the changed political dynamics in Maharashtra after the resignation of Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister, the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine has decided to elect Uddhav Thackeray as its leader to stake claim for government formation, a senior Sena leader said on Tuesday.Shiv Sena is the second largest party in the state Assembly with 56 MLAs, after the BJP which won 105 seats, and entitled to be invited by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to stake claim for government formation after BJP's Fadnavis announced his resignation.""Uddhav Thackeray will be elected the leader of the three parties to stake claim for government formation at the evening meeting scheduled to be held in a city hotel. The three parties - Sena, NCP and Congress - will then submit a joint statement to the governor to stake claim for government formation,"" the Sena leader said.Most of the issues among the Sena, NCP and Congress have been sorted out, a senior NCP leader said.""I don't think the three parties would need any more time to stake claim for government formation,"" he said.A senior official from Vidhan Bhavan said that with Fadnavis announcing his decision to quit, there was no need to hold a floor test in the Assembly on Wednesday, as directed by the Supreme Court.""Instead, the governor may invite the second largest party - Shiv Sena - to stake claim for government formation,"" he said.The governor will require a joint statement from the Sena, NCP and Congress along with signatures of their MLAs.The Sena's 56 MLAs along with the NCP and Congress' 54 and 44 legislators, respectively, would take the combine's tally to 154 in the 288-member House, where the majority mark is 145.Three days after he was sworn in, Fadnavis on Tuesday announced his resignation, saying the BJP no longer has majority after his deputy, NCP's Ajit Pawar, quit citing ""personal reasons"".Ajit Pawar, who only last week crossed over to the BJP camp and was sworn in along with Fadnavis in the early hours of Saturday morning, resigned earlier in the day.Fadnavis made the announcement ahead of the floor test his government was supposed to face on Wednesday as per the Supreme Court's directions.The BJP and the Sena fought the last month's Assembly polls in an alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively.The Sena, however, broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post."

MUMBAI: NCP leaders Jayant Patil , Dilip Walse Patil, Sunil Tatkare and Chhagan Bhujbal tried to persuade Ajit Pawar to reconsider his decision three days after he revolted and was sworn in as deputy CM in the Devendra Fadnavis government, but he has not shown any signs of relenting.“We had a prolonged meeting. We tried to persuade him to reconsider his decision in the larger interest of the party and return to NCP, but there was no response. But we are hopeful,” Bhujbal said. Walse-Patil said the meeting was useful.Since Ajit joined the government, over a dozen NCP leaders have urged him to reconsider his move. “We do not know why he took the decision, particularly when we were to stake claim in collaboration with Shiv Sena and Congress. It was decided to offer him the post of deputy CM,’’ an NCP leader said.NCP MP Sunil Tatkare met Ajit, followed by Hasan Mushriff, state NCP chief Jayant Patil and Bhujbal. Ajit’s aide Dhananjay Munde said he too felt Ajit should reconsider his decision.On November 23, Ajit submitted a letter to Raj Bhavan, stating he was leader of the NCP legislature party and had the support of 54 legislators. Ajit said he was supporting Fadnavis, following which Fadnavis was invited to form the government. A day after Ajit took over, the NCP legislature party sacked him as its leader and appointed Jayant Patil in his place.“I have come to the conclusion that Ajit, who has been removed from his position (as NCP legislature party leader for joining hands with BJP) has no legal right to issue a whip to MLAs,” Sharad Pawar said. “I take responsibility (to ensure) that your membership of the House will not become null and void. People who have acquired power illegally have to be removed now,” he said, without naming anyone."

DALTONGANJ: Mounting a blistering attack on the Congress-JMM-RJD alliance in Jharkhand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday alleged that their ""self-seeking"" past governments were driven by the ""lust for power"" and exploited the mineral-rich state's resources while neglecting its people.He also accused the previous Congress governments at the Centre of procrastinating resolution of the Kashmir tangle and the vexed Ayodhya dispute.""This election is a contest between those who serve and those who loot. The Congress has problems, we have the solutions. They have accusations, we have the report of the work we have done. They have empty promises, we have the proof of development,"" Modi told a poll rally in Daltonganj, his first ahead of the state assembly elections.The Prime Minister asserted the BJP was committed to the five principles of social justice -- stability, good governance, prosperity, respect for all and security.Naxalism flourished under the non-BJP governments due to political instability, he said.""Governments were made through the back door. There were alliances of self-seekers who were driven by the lust for power (satta bhog) and exploited the resources of the state.""They had their eyes on the riches found beneath the surface of the earth and cared little for those living on the earth. How would it then have been possible to give electricity, roads and water to people? Set up industries?"" he said.Modi said it was for the first time since the creation of Jharkhand in the year 2000 that the BJP government led by Raghubar Das had completed its full term.The Das government, he said, worked day and night to end corruption and set up institutional mechanisms for greater transparency in governance. He said the BJP government worked hard to end naxalism and crime.Raising the issue of forest rights of tribals, the Prime Minister asserted,"" The BJP is committed to protecting your right to 'Jal, Jungle, Jameen' (water, forest and land).He said a district mineral fund has been set up by the Centre to ensure that the benefits from resources mined in tribal areas reach the people there. Jharkhand has received Rs 5,000 crore from that fund, the Prime Minister said, adding steps were being taken to fast-track settlement of forest rights claims.Urging people to vote the BJP to power for a second successive term, the Prime Minister said the 'double-engine' growth of Jharkhand became possible because the party was in power both at the Centre and in the state.""We sent funds and brought pressure on the previous BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh for speeding up construction of houses for the poor but to no avail. But since the advent of the Yogi Adityanath government, UP is at the top in building dwellings for the poor,"" he said.Elaborating on the benefits of 'double-engine' growth, the Prime Minister said apart of the gas connection given to poor families under the 'Ujjwala Yojana' by the Centre, the Jharkhand government had provided second gas cylinders to 33 lakh households in the state.Under the 'Kisan Samman Nidhi' scheme, the Jharkhand government has given an additional Rs 25,000 to the targeted beneficiaries apart from the funds made available by the Centre, the Prime Minister said.""The benefits of double-engine growth are many. There is continuity of development ... no political games are played,"" he said.The Prime Minister said states like West Bengal, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where BJP's rivals were in power, were not being able to reap the fruits of central government schemes because of impediments created by the state governments.The Prime Minister also raked up the hugely divisive issues of repeal of special status granted to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.""The Congress follows the policy of procrastination so that it can keep collecting votes. The party kept the issue of article 370 pending. We had promised a resolution and we fulfilled it.""The Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya had lingered for decades. The Congress could have resolved it, if it so wanted, but it chose to hurt the society, the country to protect its vote bank. See, today the dispute stands resolved,"" he said.The Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the principle of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat', asserting unity was in the larger interest of the country.He also recalled how the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had created Jharkhand and set up a ministry to exclusively handle the welfare of tribals.""For 50 years, there was no ministry of tribal affairs to look after the interest of adivasis. There was an OBC commission but it lacked constitutional status. We ensured that constitutional status was bestowed on the Commission,"" Modi said, as he sought to reach out to the vast tribal electorate of Jharkhand."

NEW DELHI: Indicating stringent action against the Congress MPs who stormed the Well of the Lok Sabha to protest against the swearing-in of the BJP-led government in Maharashtra, Speaker Om Birla on Monday said such behaviour is ""unacceptable"" and will not be ""tolerated"".As soon as Congress MPs Hibi Eden and TN Prathapam entered the Well of the House carrying a big black banner that read 'Stop murder of democracy', the speaker warned them to go back to their seats.After his warnings went unheeded, the Speaker ordered marshals to remove the two lawmakers.Other Congress members joined in and resisted their eviction from the House. They were seen jostling with the marshals, prompting the Speaker to adjourn the House till noon.Underlining that the House should function and it should not be adjourned as it sends a wrong message in the public, Birla said, ""I am hurt by whatever happened in Parliament today. Such behaviour is unacceptable and won't be tolerated.""""I never want to adjourn the house, I always tried my best that House should function by taking everyone on board,"" he said.This is the first time in the 17th Lok Sabha with Birla at the Chair that the House was adjourned.Sources in the Lok Sabha secretariat said as Speaker named both members during proceedings of the House, they both stand suspended.Manhandling of marshals by Congress MPs has not gone well with the Speaker and he is very angry over the unruly behaviour of both members and is considering stringent action.Both MPs have refused to apologise for their conduct and the Speaker is contemplating what should be the quantum of their punishment, sources said, adding that their suspension for five years is also under consideration.In Video: LS Marshals tried to push Congress members forcefully, manhandled women too: MP Hibi Eden"

NEW DELHI: The Congress protested vociferously both inside and outside Parliament on Monday against the political developments in Maharashtra as it stalled proceedings and accused the BJP of ""murdering democracy"" in the state.While Congress president Sonia Gandhi led the protest by party MPs near Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament complex, party leader Rahul Gandhi led the charge in the Lok Sabha where he dubbed the developments in the state a ""murder of democracy"".The protests led to a commotion inside the Lok Sabha, where party MPs Hibi Eden and TN Prathapam entered the Well carrying a black banner which read 'stop murder of democracy'. This led to their suspension after the speaker named them.The party protested strongly both in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, forcing their adjournment for the day without carrying out any business.Sonia Gandhi led the party MPs near Mahatma Gandhi's statue, setting the tone for the protests. Congress leaders, including Ahmed Patel , Anand Sharma and Adhir Ranjan Choudhury, raised slogans and held placards criticising the BJP and demanding ""justice"".Rahul Gandhi refused to ask a supplementary question during the Question Hour, saying there was no point in doing it as ""democracy has been murdered in Maharashtra"".The Congress also termed the Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar government ""illegal"" and ""illegitimate"".In a dramatic development on Saturday morning, BJP's Fadnavis took oath as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar of was sworn-in as his deputy on Saturday morning.The move jolted the Congress, the NCP and the Shiv Sena, who were giving final touches to government formation in the state, but rattled the NCP the most due to Ajit Pawar's rebellion. In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, the BJP is the single largest party with 105 MLAs, followed by the Sena (56 MLAs), the NCP (54 MLAs) and the Congress (44 MLAs).Congress' youth wing IYC also staged a demonstration near the Parliament House, against the BJP-led Centre over alleged ""illegal and undemocratic"" manner of government formation in Maharashtra.Carrying their protests forward, opposition parties including Congress, NCP, TMC, DMK and Left parties, will boycott the joint sitting of both houses on Tuesday commemorating ""Samvidhan Diwas"" in the Central Hall of Parliament that will be attended by President Ram Nath Kovind.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the BJP of disregarding the Constitution in Maharashtra and repeating the ""game"" it played in Karnataka.The Congress had accused the BJP of poaching MLAs to form government in Karnataka earlier this year.""TV is showing that the BJP is disregarding institutions and Constitution in Maharashtra to repeat the game it played in Karnataka,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.The Congress general secretary said, ""12,000 farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra. For them, no help came from the BJP government's pocket. Have we reached the stage of open kidnapping of the mandate?""The Congress also said its alliance with the NCP and Shiv Sena had the support of 154 MLAs and the BJP will get a ""befitting reply"" in the floor test.The assertion came minutes after the Supreme Court said it will give its order on the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine's plea against the governor's decision to swear-in Fadnavis as chief minister.Asserting that the Constitution was ""trampled upon"" in Maharashtra, Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said an ""illegitimate government"" of the BJP and Ajit Pawar was formed.""We requested the Supreme Court that a floor test be ordered immediately so that it is proven that the majority is with the alliance formed for Maharashtra's development -- Congress-Sena-NCP. We showed the affidavits of 154 MLAs that clearly prove that the alliance has the majority,"" Surjewala told reporters, asserting the number will go up when other ""MLAs are freed from BJP's jail"".""The combine believes that the people's mandate and democracy will win in Maharashtra. The BJP, Ajit Pawar and all such forces that have trampled upon democracy, kidnapped the mandate and insulted constitutional institutions will get a befitting reply in the floor test, when Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar will be shown the door by MLAs for not having majority,"" he said.""We believe that the process will begin on Tuesday,"" Surjewala, flanked by senior Maharashtra Congress leaders Prithviraj Chavan and Mukul Wasnik, said.Chavan said some NCP MLAs had signed at ""two places"", but the first signatures were taken without permission.""Now they have given individual affidavits. There is no way but to go for a floor test. The only thing is that we want it in 24 hours and that the procedure followed in Karnataka and Uttarakhand should apply here as well,"" he said.""Why do they need time? Will horse-trading be allowed? We request the SC to order a floor test immediately. We hope that the court will give its verdict and a floor test will be ordered on Tuesday itself after the oaths of MLAs,"" the former Maharashtra CM said.Surjewala said ""contract killing of democracy"" by the BJP has also become ""contract killing of honesty and accountability"".Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the government's move of issuing a notification on Monday to close probe in nine cases of alleged corruption in irrigation projects in Maharashtra, was the ""most brazen, shameful act of conspiracy and corrupt practice"", to put together a government ""by hook or crook""."

NEW DELHI: Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday condemned the ""reprehensive conduct"" of the two Congress lawmakers who clashed with marshals in Lok Sabha , saying that the house is a place for debating and discussion and not for unruly behaviour.""We want to make our position clear. We condemn the reprehensible conduct of the two Congress members on the foot of the house. The speaker appealed to them to remove the big banner which they erected to obstruct members from asking questions and ministers from replying to it. But they did not listen,"" he told reporters at a press conference here.""We again requested them and read out the rules. Thereafter, the behaviour they did with marshals is for all of us to see. We totally condemn this behaviour of Congress MPs and the senior leadership of Congress who did not do anything to prevent this unruly behaviour on the floor of Lok Sabha,"" Prasad said.The Union Minister urged all political parties to respect the sanctity of the Parliament while adding that the Speaker holds the power to take action.""Lok Sabha is a place for debate and questioning. You cannot convert it into a place for unruly behaviour. Action will be taken by the Speaker. We expect political parties to ensure that the sanctity, serenity and the great tradition of the Lok Sabha and Parliament are restored properly,"" he said.The Lok Sabha was earlier adjourned till 2 pm following a scuffle between the Congress lawmakers and marshals stationed in the Lower House broke out after Speaker Om Birla ordered the security officers to escort the Congress MPs, who were vociferously protesting in the well against government formation in Maharashtra, out of the house.Birla repeatedly urged Congress members TN Prathapan and Hibi Eden to get rid of the big banner they were carrying in protest and warned them to invoke Rule 373 under which they will be sent out of the house.Unfazed by Speaker's warning, the two Congress members refused to let go the banner, following which the marshals were called in to escort the leaders out of the house. However, instead of abiding by Speaker's order, the two Congress MPs pushed the marshals and refused to leave the premises.Following the unwarranted chaos, the Speaker adjourned the house till 12 noon. When Lok Sabha reassembled, the house was again adjourned till 2 pm. Ultimately, the Lok Sabha was adjourned till 2 pm tomorrow after a continued uproar over Maharashtra issue in the house.According to Rule 373, the Speaker, if, is of the opinion that the conduct of any member is grossly disorderly, may direct such member to withdraw immediately from the House, and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the day's proceedings.A member named by Speaker cannot take part in the day's proceedings.Congress MPs and along with leaders of other political parties began protesting on the floor of the House as soon as the day's proceedings commenced.Earlier today, Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi led the party's protest in Parliament premises over the manner in which government had been formed in Maharashtra.In a surprise development, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn-in as the state's Chief Minister for the second time while NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath as his deputy on Saturday morning."

NEW DELHI: Maintaining that the BJP had the support of all 54 NCP MLAs to form a government in Maharashtra, the Centre on Monday asked the Supreme Court for two to three days to file a reply to the plea against the governor's decision to invite Devendra Fadnavis to become chief minister.The Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP has filed a plea against Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari's decision to swear in BJP leader Fadnavis as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.The Centre told a bench comprising Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna that the governor had in absolute discretion invited the largest party to form government on November 23.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court the Maharashtra governor is not supposed to conduct a roving and fishing inquiry to ascertain which party has numbers to form government.The question is, he said, can a party come and seek the court's intervention to hold floor test within 24 hours.Mehta said the governor was cognizant of the facts and the situation after poll results that had led to President's rule being invoked in the state.The apex court, after perusing Koshiyari's letter inviting Fadnavis, said it has to be decided whether or not the chief minister enjoys support on the floor of house.The solicitor general explained that the governor had invited Shiv Sena , BJP and NCP for government formation and President's rule was imposed only after they failed.As the hearing began on Monday morning, Mehta submitted letters of the governor and Fadnavis as asked by the bench on Sunday.The apex court said it is not considering the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress' combine's plea that they be invited to form government in Maharashtra."

PUNE: Members of the Pawar family on Sunday made an emotional appeal toto put family before power.“Power comes and goes... only relationships matter,” Supriya Sule said in a social media post, a day after Ajit unexpectedly pledged support to BJP and was sworn in as deputy CM. His move came hours after Shiv Sena , NCP and Congress cobbled together a government-formation plan. At least for a few hours, it upended all political calculations. Sule put out a post on social media, which read, “Who do you trust in life... never felt so cheated in my life... defended him, loved him... look what I get in return.”In a series of social media updates on Sunday, Sule said Saturday was one of the toughest days of her life, and vowed to come out stronger. “These are difficult times for us as a family, but at the same time there were many people who came out in our support; many who reached out to us in this difficult time. I am thankful to all of them,” she stated.A hopeful Sule told TOI that the party leadership was making efforts to reach out to her cousin. The Baramati MP also expressed admiration for her father, party chief Sharad Pawar. “He may win, he may lose, but Sharad Pawar is fighting this battle like a real Maratha warrior, against every odd (sic), be it Modi-Shah’s brute power, traitors within his family or his own age and health... haven’t heard of this level of determination,” she stated.“We are very confident that we would still serve the people of the state better... honesty and hard work never go to waste. That path is harder, but it sustains in the long term,” Sule said. In another post on social media, Rohit Pawar, Sharad’s grandnephew, urged Ajit to reconsider his decision."

RANCHI/ DALTONGANJ: Police, paramilitary forces and BJP candidates are awaiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s visit on Monday. While the BJP candidates are hoping that the Prime Minister’s presence at public meetings in Jharkhand ’s Palamu and Gumla will turn the votes in their favour, the security personnel are busy grappling with the heightened threat perception surrounding Modi’s security at the two venues — Chiyanki airport and proposed site of Gumla airport — following two attacks in Latehar and Palamu that left six dead, including four policemen, since Friday night. The Maoists have owned up to the attacks late on Sunday.While the state police top brass along with SPG officials went over the security arrangements, Naxals upped their ante on Sunday by putting up poll-boycott threat posters in some villages in Barkagaon near Hazaribag, located 170 km from Palamu and 190 km from Gumla."

RANCHI: Congress on Sunday headlined its 40-page manifesto for the Jharkhand assembly elections with a promise to raise job reservation for OBCs from 14 to 27%, provide employment to at least one member of every household and institute a separate Sarna (religious) code for tribals.“This is not just our poll announcement, but a commitment to our people. If we come to power, our government will work to implement these in tandem with our alliance partners,” UP Congress leader RPN Singh, who is the party’s Jharkhand in-charge, said in the presence of state president Rameshwar Oraon and others.“All vacant positions in government departments shall be immediately filled and a policy to convert contractual workers into permanent ones will be introduced. To those whom we can’t give jobs, we will pay unemployment allowance,” he added.Oraon said the tribal population’s long-standing demand for a separate Sarna code would be fulfilled if Congress came to power.Congress’s push for higher OBC reservation is being seen as an attempt to blunt BJP and its disgruntled ally Ajsu-P’s attempts to get the first-mover advantage on this issue. Union home minister Amit Shah had announced at a rally in Lohardaga last week that a commission would be set up to review OBC quota, based on the population demographics in Jharkhand.Congress’s manifesto also promises farm-loan waivers and repeal of Land Acquisition Act amendments brought by the Raghubar Das government."

Sometimes one wants to become this, sometimes one wants to become that, but it is true that I never had the desire to enter politics, nor I ever thought about it,"" he said.He said but now that he is a politician, ""I keep thinking how I can work for the welfare of the country.""The thought that had he not joined politics, what would he be doing never crosses his mind, Modi said.""Now, wherever I am, I should live life to the fullest and I should wholeheartedly work for my country ... I have now dedicated myself for this purpose only,"" he said.Responding to a question on whether he gets time to watch television and read books, he said he was always fond of reading.He had little interest in watching films and he watches very little TV.""I used to read books. But these days I am unable to read and due to Google, the habit of reading has deteriorated because if you want to seek a reference, then you immediately find a shortcut.

KOLKATA: With Amit Shah 's pitch for a nationwide NRC exercise and the recent Ayodhya verdict having received mixed reactions from various quarters, the November 25 bypolls to three Assembly seats in Bengal will be a litmus test for the TMC and the BJP, ahead of 2021 state elections.It will be the first electoral contest between the two parties since this year's Lok Sabha polls, which saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the main opposition in the state, with 18 of the 42 seats in its kitty, just four less than that of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC).Two of the three Assembly constituencies - Kharagpur Sadar and Karimpur - fell vacant post general election as the sitting MLAs contested and won Lok Sabha seats.bypolls were necessitated in Kaliaganj following the death of Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy.Congress nominee Dhitashree Roy, also supported by the CPI(M), will take on TMC's Tapan Deb Sinha and BJP's Kamal Chandra Sarkar in Kaliaganj.In Karimpur, vacated by MLA Mahua Moitra after emerging victorious from Krishnnanagar Lok Sabha seat, the CPI(M)-Congress candidate Gholam Rabbi is contesting against BJP's Jay Prakash Majumdar and TMC's Bimalendu Singha Roy.Prem Chandra Jha of the BJP will take on Chittaranjan Mandal of the Congress-CPI(M) alliance and Pradip Sarkar of the TMC in Kharagpur Sadar Assembly seat - vacated by MLA Dilip Ghosh after winning Medinipur Lok Sabha seatThe results will be declared on November 28.Chances are likely that the saffron party's masterstroke in Maharashtra and Haryana, along with the NRC proposal and the tabling of Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, would cast a shadow on the November 25 bypolls.The Ayodhya verdict, which cleared the way for construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site, might also have political ramifications, ahead of the 2021 polls.On the back foot since the NRC in Assam left out over 19 lakh people, most of them reportedly Hindus, the Ayodhya verdict has provided the BJP in West Bengal fresh ammunition to polarise the electorate.For the BJP, the challenge is to live up to its performance in the parliamentary polls, whereas the TMC will try hard to regain its lost political ground.The bypolls will also decide if the Congress and the CPI(M), which have come together after three years, will remain relevant in state politics.The Congress had bagged two seats while the CPI(M) drew a blank in the Lok Sabha polls this year.As the BJP increased its tally from two seats in 2014 to 18 seats in 2019 by bagging 40.5 per cent votes, the TMC witnessed a slump in its number of seats - down from 34 in 2014 to 22 this time.""We are confident of winning all three seats in the bypolls. The people of West Bengal have made up their mind to defeat the TMC in 2021 Assembly polls in the state,"" BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said.According to a section of state BJP leaders, the party's failure to win majority in Maharashtra and Haryana Assemblies, with a resurgent Congress putting up a good show in the northern state, might have not gone down well with its ranks in West Bengal.""In the Lok Sabha polls, we had swept Haryana and Maharashtra. But in less than six months, the Assembly poll results showed that Narendra Modi as the prime minister remains unchallenged at the national level, but the same cannot be said for the state leaders.""We are a bit apprehensive that something similar may happen in West Bengal,"" a senior state BJP leader said on the condition of anonymity.Karimpur and Kaliaganj seats have a sizeable Muslim and Dalit population. Most of the Dalits in the two seats are descendants of refugees, who fled to India during Partition and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.The exclusion of a large number of Hindus from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in neighbouring Assam is also a point of concern for the saffron party, which has promised to carry out the exercise in Bengal, if voted to power in 2021.""The panic that followed the NRC exercise in Assam has taken the winds out of the BJP's sails to an extent. So to counter the narrative of the TMC on the issue, we have come up with the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, by which all Hindu refugees will be accorded citizenship.""It remains to be seen which narrative gets accepted in Karimpur and Kaliaganj,"" the BJP leader said.The Lok Sabha election results, earlier this year, showed that the BJP was ahead in Kaliaganj and Kharagpur Sadar, while the TMC in Karimpur.In Kharagpur Sadar, which has a very high non-Bengali population, the Ram Mandir issue is expected to help the saffron party consolidate Hindu votes.However, rebel BJP leader Pradip Kumar Patnaik, who has formed the BJP Bachao Committee and is fighting as an Independent, could also play a spoiler for the saffron camp.The TMC, through its mass outreach campaign 'Didi ke Bolo' (Tell Didi) over the last three months, hopes to revive much of its ground lost to the BJP.""The people of West Bengal, in the last five-six months, have understood that the BJP is a communal and divisive force. In the bypolls, we will win all three seats.""Apart from local issues and rural distress caused due to the Centre's economic policies, we have highlighted the BJP's malicious plans to impose NRC in the state, which will turn legal citizens into refugees,"" TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said.The CPI(M)-led Left Front and the Congress, both fighting for their political existence in Bengal, have sealed a seat adjustment for Monday's bypolls.The Congress will contest Kaliaganj and Kharagpur Sadar seats, while the Left Front will fight from Karimpur. It will be a challenge for the two parties to cut into minority votes of the TMC and anti-establishment votes of the BJP.""We are hopeful that people will realize that the Congress-CPI(M) alliance can be the only alternative to the TMC, as a communal force like the BJP will never be accepted in the state,"" Congress state president Somen Mitra said."

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Sunday asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to place before it on Monday morning the letters of Maharashtra Governor recommending revocation of President's rule in the state and inviting Devendra Fadnavis to form government.In the special hearing on a holiday, the apex court also issued notices to the Centre, Maharashtra government on the petition filed by Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine against the Maharashtra Governor's decision to swear in Fadnavis as chief minister.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Ashok Bhushan and Sanjiv Khanna also issued notice to Fadnavis and Dy chief minister Ajit Pawar.The bench declined fervent request of Mehta seeking two days time to place Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari 's communication on record and asked him to produce letters by Monday at 10:30 am when the matter will be taken again.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal and A M Singhvi, appearing for the combine, told the bench that floor test be conducted today itself so that it can be ascertained that Fadnavis enjoys majority in the house.They maintained that post-poll alliance of the three parties have the majority in the 288-member house.While Sibal termed as 'bizarre' the Governor's decision to revoke President's rule and anoint Fadnavis as the chief minister, Singhvi said it is a ""murder of democracy"".Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for two BJP MLAs and some independents, questioned the maintainability of the writ petition filed by the combine and said they should have approached the Bombay High Court.At the outset, the Shiv Sena-NCP-Cong combine asserted that they have the majority in the Maharashtra Assembly and if Fadnavis has the numbers he should prove majority on floor of the House.The combine also said that it was 'betrayal and annihilation' of democracy that government has been allowed to be formed when 41 NCP MLAs are not with the BJP.""If Devendra Fadnavis has numbers to prove majority, let him prove it on the floor of House, else we have numbers to form government in Maharashtra,"" Sibal said.Singhvi submitted that 41 MLAs of NCP are with Sharad Pawar.While 54 is the total strength of NCP, 41 MLAs wrote to the Maharashtra Governor saying Ajit Pawar has been removed as its leader, Singhvi told the bench.Sibal said that November 30 deadline given by the Governor to the ruling party to prove majority is meant to do 'something else'.""It is a complete 'betrayal and annihilation' of democracy where government has been allowed to be formed when 41 NCP MLAs are not with them,"" they submitted.The top court said none is disputing that floor test is the best method to show majority.Rohatgi said how can a political party approach apex court under Article 32 for violation of Fundamental Rights.""They (three parties) were given time but they did not form government, so let Fadnavis prove majority as there was no tearing hurry, Rohatgi told the bench.Singhvi referred to judgements in various cases including dismissal of the Uttarakhand Cong govt, saying that floor test is ultimate test.He also referred to the 2018 apex court's order in Karnataka case and said floor test was ordered and there was no secret ballot.""Floor test is Constitutional obligation, no formality is needed and it can be ordered,"" Singhvi told the bench.Rohatgi further said that the Governor's decision to invite political party is not open to judicial review as it is his discretionary power.""What governor did yesterday is immune from any judicial review, choice of party is with him,"" Rohatgi said.He said Floor test is ultimate and 2-3 days time should be given to prove majority.Rohatgi submitted that even orders of Governor have not been filed and the plea filed by the combine is without any documents and annexures.He also said that Governor or President has some discretion and immunity under Article 361 to choose a person who stakes claim and appoint him as the chief minister or the Prime Minister.""Every party should be allowed some time to respond to plea and allow us to spend Sunday peacefully,"" Rohatgi said concluding arguments.In Video: SC issues notice to Centre, Maha govt, hearing to continue tomorrow"

MUMBAI: The BJP on Sunday expressed confidence that Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will prove his government's majority in the state assembly, claiming he has the support of more than 170 MLAs.Talking to reporters here, BJP leader Ashish Shelar said Fadnavis will provide a stable and strong government.""With Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar having taken oath, there is a sense of happiness and positivity among people,"" he said.""Fadnavis has the support of more than 170 MLAs and the BJP government will prove majority on the floor of the House,"" he said.Shelar said governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has given time till November 30 to the new government to prove its majority on the floor of the House.He rejected the charge that the swearing in on Saturday was done ""in the cover of darkness"".""We are RSS volunteers who attend shakhas at 6 am. We consider what we do early morning as good,"" the former Mumbai BJP chief said.Hitting out at the Shiv Sena , he quipped, ""What is done in the cover of darkness is going to meet Congress leader Ahmed Patel in a car which had black-tinted glass.""He was apparently referring to reports in a section of media about Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's meeting with Patel last week.Fadnavis on Saturday returned as the state's chief minister propped up by Ajit Pawar, who was made his deputy, just hours after the new alliance of Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress reached a consensus that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be their chief ministerial candidate.Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in by governor Koshyari at a hush hush ceremony here, leading to lifting of the President's rule in the state.Ajit Pawar's volte face created fissures in the NCP, whose chief Sharad Pawar distanced himself from his nephew's dramatic action, saying the decision to back Fadnavis was his personal choice and not that of the party.On Saturday evening, the NCP removed Ajit Pawar as the party's legislature unit head, saying his move was not in line with the party's policies.The BJP and the Sena, which fought the last month's assembly polls in an alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively.The Sena, however, broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post.The Congress and the NCP, both pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats respectively."

MUMBAI: A thriller straight out of the playbook of guerrilla warfare was played out in Mumbai early Saturday morning when, contrary to expectations that Uddhav Thackeray would take up the chief minister’s post soon as Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP coalition talks were close to completion, BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis was, at 8am, sworn in as Maharashtra chief minister for the second time running, with NCP’s Ajit Pawar as his deputy.Events unfolded at breathtaking speed post-midnight when Ajit Pawar decided to bolt the NCP stables. Governor B S Koshyari sent a communication to the Centre recommending lifting of President’s rule. By the crack of dawn, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had used his special powers to end Central rule without calling a meeting of the Union Cabinet. Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar were sworn in at the governor’s residence, with just a few netas, apart from officials, in attendance.The coup, which came after NCP and Congress got stalemated over who should bag the post of Speaker in the three-party coalition being planned, caught NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray, the “CM-in-waiting,” by complete surprise.Recovering from the shock inflicted by his nephew, Sharad Pawar said the decision to go with BJP was nephew Ajit’s own and not that of his party and after scrambling by the Sena, NCP and Congress to secure their flock, the ‘Maha Vikas Aghadi’ of the three parties had pushed back by late evening. In a retaliatory strike, NCP removed Ajit Pawar as its legislature party leader, replacing him with Jayant Patil at a meeting attended by 48 of the party’s 54 MLAs.The components of the Aghadi filed a joint petition in in the Supreme Court terming as “illegal” Maharashtra governor Koshyari’s move to invite the Fadnavis-led BJP to form government. The petition, which also demanded an immediate composite floor test where MLAs would be asked to vote either for Uddhav Thackeray or Devendra Fadnavis to decide which coalition forms the next government, will be heard by the apex court at 11.30am today.If the SC move does not work out, the Aghadi has plans to parade all its legislators before the President to establish that the Fadnavis government does not have a majority.Even as it moved to nip the rebellion by warning that the “defectors” would be disqualified and defeated in the resultant by-elections, NCP tried the persuasion track to bring the prodigal nephew home. By late Saturday evening, three NCP leaders —Sunil Tatkare, Hasan Mushrif and Dilip Walse Patil— met Ajit Pawar at his uncle Srinivas Pawar’s Napean Sea Road residence where he had been ensconced after the swearing-in and tried to persuade him to return to the party fold. However, there was no response from Ajit, sources said.Though the NCP said 49 of its MLAs were present at its late evening meeting called at Y B Chavan Centre at Nariman Point for removal of Ajit Pawar as legislature party chief and five, including Ajit, were “not in touch with the party”, the numbers remained unclear at the time of going to press as Ajit did not speak on the subject later in the day.Also, three NCP MLAs were shepherded into the NCP legislature meeting called by Pawar senior either by NCP or Sena leaders—one of them from the airport.To confuse matters, Dhananjay Munde — whose official residence near Mantralaya was the centre of all the early-morning activity as that was where Ajit’s loyalist MLAs were told to gather — made a surprise entry at the meeting of the NCP legislature party to decide the course of action against Ajit.BJP justified its move and the governor’s action, saying that Koshyari had acted on the basis of a letter from NCP declaring Ajit Pawar to be the leader of the NCP legislature party and by saying that the return of Fadnavis as CM was in harmony with the mandate of the election, where BJP along with Sena had won a clean majority. Its leaders also termed Ajit Pawar’s switchover a punishment to Sena for “betraying” the popular opinion. “They contested and won election with BJP’s support and on the strength of the popularity of Narendra Modi’s appeal but have defected to the parties they fought against,” went the saffron refrain.They agreed that Sharad Pawar would fight hard to stop the party from being taken over by his nephew but remained confident of Fadnavis surviving the floor test.A total of 11 NCP MLAs were present at Raj Bhavan with Ajit Pawar for the swearing-in ceremony after President’s Rule in the state was lifted at 5.47am on the basis of letters submitted by Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar to the governor. The letter submitted by Ajit Pawar had signatures of all 54 NCP MLAs. However, at a joint presser with Uddhav Thackeray at noon, Sharad Pawar said, “As NCP legislature party leader, Ajit Pawar had the list of all 54 MLAs with names, signatures and constituencies for internal party use. I presume he has submitted that list as a letter of support to the governor.” If that was the case, then it was “misuse” of the letter, the NCP chief said.Koshyari was the target of the newly-minted alliance of non-BJP formations. Both Congress leader Ahmed Patel and Sharad Pawar came down heavily on the governor for inviting Fadnavis to form government. “It’s a black day in the political history of Maharashtra. It was wrong on the part of the governor to invite the BJP leader for formation of government without verifying the number of legislators,” Patel said.Sharad Pawar said the three parties would take legal recourse. “From the numbers, it appears we had a clear majority. We were in the process of staking claim, but we found the governor had quietly administered the oath of office and secrecy to Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar,” he said.The NCP chief said he was indeed in the dark about the developments and had never expected his nephew to take such an anti-party decision. “This is indiscipline. I am surprised. If a few legislators join hands with Ajit Pawar, they will invite provisions of the anti-defection law. We will ensure that these defectors, from wherever they contest, will be defeated. A few legislators did leave with Ajit Pawar, but most of them have returned to the NCP fold. They were misled by Ajit Pawar,” he said.Uddhav too launched a frontal attack against the governor. “We will move the apex court against the governor’s decision,” he said at the presser. “I am sure that despite the political situation, no Shiv Sena legislator will quit or defect. Our legislators are firm,” he claimed.In the 288-member assembly, the BJP has 105 MLAs, the Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.In Video: Maha politics: Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress approach SC"

MUMBAI: There were not many people at Raj Bhavan Friday morning when he was sworn in as Maharashtra CM for the second time, but the fact that 49-year-old Devendra Fadnavis managed to occupy the hot seat for the second time against all odds says something about his tenacity.When he first became the CM in 2014, it was in a public ceremony at the sprawling Wankhede Stadium in south Mumbai, in presence of his mother, wife, daughter and thousands of BJP workers and supporters.At Friday's ceremony, which opposition Congress dubbed a clandestine affair after a night of intriguing political developments, the pomp and grandeur of the 2014 event was missing.After results of the October 21 assembly elections were announced on October 24, Fadnavis was all set to return as chief minister of Maharashtra, after steering the BJP to another electoral win and dealing the NCP-Congress a blow but bickering ally Shiv Sena played spoilsport.The Nagpur-born BJP leader with close family links to the RSS has become the first non-Congress chief minister to win a second term in office in the state, and only the second chief minister to complete his term in office.The poll victory in Maharashtra for India's main ruling party was not as decisive as it was hoping for.The BJP, which contested 164 seats, bagged 105, while the Shiv Sena won 56 in the 288-strong Assembly but the alliance fell apart after the Sena insisted on sharing the CM's post.Fadnavis is a law graduate from Nagpur University and holds a postgraduate degree in business management. He was born and raised in Nagpur, home of the headquarters of the RSS. His father Gangadhar Fadnavis was associated with the RSS and hence young Devendra was influenced with the RSS ideology.Starting his political career in the 1990s, Fadnavis was an elected member in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation for two consecutive terms - in 1992 and 1997. He was also the youngest mayor of Nagpur, and the second youngest mayor in India.He has represented the Nagpur-South West seat in the state Assembly since 1999.It was perhaps his close equation with the RSS that helped Fadnavis navigate the troubled waters of Maharashtra politics.Fadnavis had a smooth run in his first outing as CM, having been given a free hand by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah With the BJP's victory in the Lok Sabha polls and in the state elections, Fadnavis proved his credentials as an astute political leader who has left his political rivals behind in his rise to the top, said party insiders.He inducted senior Congress leaders Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Harshvardhan Patil and a host of top NCP leaders into the BJP, pushing the opposition camp, already down and out after successive defeats in the Lok Sabha polls, into the defensive ahead of the elections.The NCP won 54 seats and the Congress 44 in the polls.Political observers describe Fadnavis as a patient listener and a ""man of action"" with extensive knowledge in various spheres. He is also known as a politician who is both erudite and popular with the people.His first five-year tenure was marked by several pluses — the Maratha reservation, the Jalyukt Shivar water conservation scheme, the Nagpur-Mumbai knowledge corridor, farm loan waiver and expansion of the Metro rail network.The Maratha quota agitation threatened the survival of his government, but Fadnavis reached out to the protesters andannounced setting up of the State Backward Class Commission to get the demand for reservation in jobs and education ratified and enacted a legislation.Similarly, instead of giving the loan waiver amount to banks, he assured that the the money was transferred directly into the accounts of farmers.With the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' attacking the government frequently through its editorials, relations between the partners reached a breaking point in the run up to the Mumbai civic polls, which prompted NCP chief Sharad Pawar to predict collapse of the government.""Political reality determines what decisions need to be made. Patience is the key,"" Fadnavis told PTI in an interaction last month.""When you face challenges, they teach you a lot. I learnt political maturity. Whatever agenda you set yourself ... every morning throws up a new challenge and problems. While tackling every new challenge, I learnt that I must not give up my focus on what I propose to do,"" he said.Fadnavis has set his goal in second term of making the state drought free, for which he plans to divert excess rain water from Konkan region to the Godavari valley.He has also proposed to set up a water grid for the perennially parched Marathwada region. He also said his goal is to make the state a 'one trillion dollar economy'.In the last five years, Fadnavis maintained his image as Mr Clean of BJP, while deftly handling corruption allegations against some of his ministerial colleagues.His wife Amruta is a banker and a playback singer while daughter Divija is in school. Mother Sarita is a homemaker."

MUMBAI: BJP's Devendra Fadnavis and NCP leader Ajit Pawar took oath as the Maharashtra chief minister and deputy chief minister respectively on Saturday, ana day after Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray emerged as the Sena-NCP-Congress' consensus candidate for the top post. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, however, said it was his nephew, and not that of the party, to support the Bharatiya Janata Party to form the government.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut accusedin the back by deciding to join hands with the BJP. He said Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray would address ain Mumbai soon.The month-long political impasse ended dramatically with Fadnavis returning as the chief minister after the President's rule, imposed in the state on November 12, was revoked early on Saturday.The development raised eyebrows not only in the political circles, but also among the people of the state as the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress had been holding talks over forming the government in the state.It was only on Friday evening that Sharad Pawar had said the new government would be led by Uddhav Thackeray, which signalled the end of speculation on who would occupy the chief minister's post.The three parties had even prepared a draft common minimum programme (CMP) to guide the actions of the new government.However, after the oath-taking ceremony was held early on Saturday, Sharad Pawar tweeted: ""Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his.""Talking to reporters, Raut said: ""Ajit Pawar has stabbed the Shiv Sena in the back. Joining hands with the BJP to form the government is.""The BJP and the Sena, which fought the assembly polls in an alliance, had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member House. However, the Sena broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post.The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats respectively."

MUMBAI: NCP's Ajit Pawar who took oath as deputy chief minister of Maharashtra on Saturday said that the NCP chose to go with the BJP for government formation in the state so that the problems faced by the farmers are resolved at the earliest.""After results, no government was formed. There are many problems including that of farmers and if a government is formed then these issues would be resolved at the earliest. That's why we have decided to form the government and taken this decision,"" Pawar told ANI after taking oath.In what can be termed as a surprising development, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday took oath as Maharashtra chief minister for the second consecutive term while NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath as deputy chief minister of the state.The move came at a time when deliberations between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena seemingly reached the final stage on Friday.The BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, could not stake claim to form a government as its ally Shiv Sena remained firm on rotating the Chief Minister's post and equal sharing of Cabinet berths.Shiv Sena parted its ways with BJP to explore ways to form a government. It, however, failed to prove the support of the required number of MLAs in the time given by state Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.The governor had then invited NCP, the third-largest party, to prove its ability to form the government failing which President's Rule was imposed in the state.The BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44."

NEW DELHI: Ramdas Athawale , a BJP ally in Maharashtra and Union minister, on Friday said the saffron party's leadership should have agreed to the Shiv Sena 's demand of the chief minister's post for two-and-a-half years so that power would not have slipped out from their hands.The Republican Party of India (RPI-A) leader's remarks come in the wake of the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena inching towards sealing a deal on forming an alliance government in the state.The state has been facing a political crisis after the Sena broke its three-decade-long ties with the BJP after the latter declined to share the chief minister's post.""Shiv Sena had repeatedly asked for the chief minister's post for two-and a-half-years, but the BJP said that there had been no such agreement earlier on this and it had 120 MLAs. In such a situation, the Sena has joined hands with the Congress and NCP. With the alliance of the three parties, the door for power has opened for them,"" Athawale told PTI.""The BJP delayed things. If they would have accepted the Shiv Sena's proposal and Devendra Fadnavis would have become the chief minister for two-and-a-half years, their friendship would have continued,"" he said.But the BJP thought that the Congress will not support the Shiv Sena and they would come back to the alliance and did not act, the minister of state for social justice and empowerment said.Asked if the BJP should have accepted the Shiv Sena's demand of having the CM post for two-and-a-half years, Athawale said, ""Instead of allowing power to slip out of its hand, if the BJP would have agreed, the Sena would not have left the alliance. If the Sena was not listening, the BJP should have agreed.""The step Uddhav Thackeray has taken is against the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray, he said, adding that the Congress also stands to lose.He also said that it was doubtful if the Sena-NCP-Congress government will last the full five years as they are ideologically different.""In my personal opinion, the Congress should also ask for the CM post for one-and-a-half years, NCP should also get one-and-a-half years and Sena should get two years,"" he said."

BENGALURU: JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Friday alleged that BJP central leaders were strategising on removing Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa from the top post.The former chief minister also reiterated about his party's aim to defeat disqualified legislators contesting the December 5 bypolls to 15 assembly constituencies in the state.""More than me, central BJP leaders were strategising in Delhi about how soon they can remove Yediyurappa (as chief minister)... how to remove him,"" Kumaraswamy said.Speaking to reporters here, he said the by-elections were taking place amid confusion in all political parties.Asked whether Yediyurappa government will not last long, he said ""Lets see on December 9 (bypoll results date).He (Yediyurappa) himself has reportedly (told his cabinet colleagues) that the recently held cabinet meeting should not be last one... he himself lacks confidence.""The ruling BJP needs to win at least six seats in the bypolls to remain in a majority in the 224-member assembly, which will still have two vacant seats- Maski and R R Nagar.JD(S) leaders, who have indicated that they don't want mid-term polls, have already stated that a call will be taken on the party's role, in case the ruling BJP loses majority, only after the results are out.Clarifying that his call for the defeat of disqualified legislators, who are now BJP candidates, does not mean joining hands with the Congress, Kumaraswamy said I'm not saying that Congress should win, I'm saying that 15 disqualified legislators should lose.Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah too recently said the main objective of Congress and its erstwhile alliance partner JD(S) in the byelections was to defeat defectors from the two parties who are now the BJP candidates.However, he made it clear that the path of the two parties in achieving the objective was different.The Congress and JD(S), who ran a coalition government for 14 months and contested Lok Sabha polls in alliance, have parted ways ever since the collapse of the Kumaraswamy ministry in July following the rebellion by 17 MLAs and are contesting the bypolls independently.The bypolls were necessitated after the resignation and subsequent disqualification of the 17 legislators by then assembly speaker K R Ramesh Kumar in July after the fall of the Congress-JDS government that paved the way for the BJP to come to power.Though Ramesh Kumar disqualified the MLAs till the end of the term of the present assembly in 2023, the Supreme Court recently allowed them to contest the bypolls following which they joined the BJP.With winning majority seats crucial for the government's survival, the BJP has fielded 13 disqualified legislators as party candidates from their respective constituencies.Kumaraswamy said JD(S) has taken the bypolls ""seriously"" and party workers will not let go Mahalakshmi Layout assembly constituency, one of the 15 constituencies going to the bypolls, easily.Targeting BJP candidate in Mahalakshmi Layout- Gopaliah, who was disqualified from JD(S), he alleged police machinery was being misused to threaten JD(S) workers.""We will not fear it, we have seen it enough...we are determined to defeat him (Gopalaiah) and teach him a lesson.""Also targeting Union Minister Sadananda Gowda, Kumaraswamy said ""he is doing politics based on the votes garnered in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi."""

BISHRAMPUR (Jharkhand): Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre made the country proud by abrogating Article 370 in Kashmir, as the special status granted to the Valley ""posed a challenge to India's unity"".Addressing a poll meeting here in Palamu, Gadkari said abolition of articles 370 and 35 A had featured on the agenda of the Jan Sangh and the BJP since Independence.He alleged that the erstwhile Congress governments did not take any measure to scrap the special provisions in Kashmir as they were afraid of losing votes.""Why is that the Congress and the so-called secular parties never touched Article 370? They were afraid of losing votes. The special status had always posed a challenge to the unity of the country.""We are proud that the Modi government took the bold and decisive step,"" the Union minister said.The senior BJP leader also hailed the Modi government for its efforts to ban the practice of instant 'triple talaq'.""It is an issue of social justice. The move to ban instant 'triple talaq' should not be viewed through the prism of religion and politics,"" he asserted.Attacking the opposition alliance of the JMM, the Congress and the RJD in the state, Gadkari said the coalition was a temporary one and that people should avoid voting for a 'khichri' government.""The Raghubar Das-led BJP government has provided good governance over the past five years. A 'khichri' government only puts roadblocks in the path of development,"" he added.Assembly elections will be held in Jharkhand in five phases. Bishrampur goes to polls during the first phase on November 30.The BJP has fielded sitting MLA and the state's health minister, Ramchandra Chandravanshi, from the seat."

JAIPUR: The Congress wants a ""grand temple"" to be built in Ayodhya, Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said on Friday, days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the shrine in the Hindu holy town.He also said the court's decision was acceptable to all and people should now stop doing politics on the issue.In its verdict announced on November 9, the Supreme Court backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and ruled that an alternative five-acre plot be allotted for building a mosque in the town.""Everyone has welcomed the decision and the Congress party wants a grand temple be built there (Ayodhya),"" Pilot told reporters in Dausa district.""We have to happily respect and maintain that decision. Now we have to stop doing politics on this issue; the world is moving forward,"" he said.People who had been doing politics over the case for the past 30 years understand now that no one will benefit politically by raising the issue again and again, he added, without naming anyone.Speaking about the Congress' performance in the recent civic body polls in Rajasthan and assembly elections in some states, Pilot said there is a change in the country's atmosphere.""(Congress') performance in the recent civic body elections reflects that the organisation and workers have worked hard and people have liked the government's work. State assembly results in Haryana and the alliance government taking shape in Maharashtra reflect that the atmosphere in the country is changing,"" he said.""The way we have worked in Rajasthan, I am happy to say that the Congress organisation worked as hard and with as much preparedness as it did when it was in the opposition,"" the deputy chief minister said.The Congress registered an impressive victory in the civic body elections held in the state earlier this month to elect 2,000 councillors. The party got a clear majority in 20 of the 49 municipal areas that went to polls.Pliot said the BJP had always believed urban areas to be its stronghold, but the party could only manage a majority in six areas.He said while the BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan six months ago, people had given the mandate to the Congress now."

NEW DELHI: Led by home minister Amit Shah , BJP had made nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution a referendum on the Narendra Modi government in last month’s Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections. However, with the ruling party failing to win a majority on its own in both states, the issue has taken a backseat in the forthcoming Jharkhand assembly poll.Jharkhand goes to polls in five phases - on November 30, December 7, 12, 16 and 20. Counting of votes will take place on December 23.Shah kicked off the party’s campaign for the Jharkhand assembly election on Thursday. He addressed two election rallies - one each in Manika and Lohardaga. At both rallies, Shah referred to the nullification of Article 370, but unlike during the Maharashtra and Haryana polls, the BJP president did not say the party was ready for a referendum on Article 370 through the Jharkhand assembly poll.Further, Shah did not delve into several other issues which he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought up repeatedly during the Maharashtra and Haryana elections, such as the surgical strikes, air strikes and banning instant triple talaq.But Shah did bring up the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict on the Ram Mandir that was pronounced on November 9, accusing the Congress of stalling the case for all these years.He focused on the development works carried out by the BJP government in Jharkhand led by chief minister Raghubar Das. He also invoked 19th century tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda.During the Maharashtra and Haryana elections, BJP had contested mainly on the Article 370 plank, linking it to nationalism. Opposition parties, meanwhile, focused on the state of the economy and jobs or the lack of it.Shah had then appealed to the people of Maharashtra to decide whether they were in favour of abrogation of Article 370 and 35A or against it. Narendra Modi also presented the abrogation of Article 370 as one of the main achievements of his government, even referring to Article 370 at the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ show at Houston in the US on September 22.But the strategy did not accrue dividends for the BJP. The party fell short of a majority on its own in both the states. While it managed to form the government in Haryana with the support of Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), in Maharashtra, its alliance partner Shiv Sena demanded the chief minister’s post as part of a 50:50 power-sharing formula following the former's less than stellar performance.The BJP, however, refused to yield to Shiv Sena’s demand, and according to latest development, Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray is on his way to form the government with the support of Congress and Sharad Pawar-led NCP."

RANCHI: Terming the alliance among Shiv Sena , NCP and Congress as opportunistic, senior BJP leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said even if they formed the government in Maharashtra , it will not last beyond six to eight months.In an interview to PTI during electioneering in Jharkhand , he said the alliance forged by these ""ideologically different"" parties was just to keep the BJP out of power, which was unfortunate. The state is going to five-phased polls from November 30.""Opportunism is the base of their alliance. The three parties have become united with the only motto to keep the BJP out of power. I have doubts whether this government will be formed... Even if it is formed, it will not last beyond six to eight months,” Gadkari told PTI.Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP are discussing the modalities for forming the government in Maharashtra. A long-time ally,with the BJP after the state poll results amid differences over chief ministership.Asked if the BJP will try forming the government in case the alliance breaks, the minister said in case of such circumstances, the party will decide its future course of strategy.""Anything can happen in cricket and politics"", he quipped adding that it was beyond his comprehension why the three parties will forge an alliance to form the government despite huge ideological differences.The base of Shiv Sena and the BJP alliance was ""Hindutva"", he said.Gadkari said Shiv Sena's claim that the chief minister would be on a rotational basis was found untrue when he enquired.""As per party President and others, the party's stance on chief minister was to be decided later but things took an unfortunate turn,” Gadkari said.The chief minister should be from the party which got a higher mandate, he said adding that the decision as to who will be the chief minister lies with Maharashtra party president, state chief minister and the BJP president.""We did our efforts,"" Gadkari said.On what transpired in the meeting between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Gadkari said he was not aware of the details.The Congress Working Committee on Thursday granted in-principle approval to the party to form the government in Maharashtra along with the NCP and the Shiv Sena, sources had said.In Video: Govt won't last six months, Nitin Gadkari takes a jibe at Shiv Sena, Congress-NCP alliance"

If we (MPs) take a pledge then the message will be delivered to the people of the country. We should take a pledge in the session so that the message is delivered to the world that India's Parliament has taken such a pledge,"" Birla said.Birla's recommendation was welcomed by MPs in the Lower House. He also asked Congress party leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in Lok Sabha, who also gave his nod.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar lauded the idea and said: ""This is a good proposal. We support this.""Addressing the citizen of the country during the 57th episode of 'Mann ki Baat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that 130 crore Indians have resolved to get rid of single-use plastic on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.The Prime Minister also mentioned about the resolve and other steps being taken to combat environmental challenges, during his speech at the 74th session of the UNGA in New York.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had appreciated the Government of India's decision to ban the usage of single-use plastic in the country, a move aimed at going beyond mere talks on climate change."

RANCHI/ LOHARDAGA: Addressing his first election rally after the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya judgment, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday accused Congress of blocking the construction of Ram temple by stalling the case while crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi with “solving all problems pending in the country”.Raking up the issue at his rallies in Manika and Lohardaga, he said: “Congress was repeatedly not allowing the case to be heard. Now, Supreme Court has delivered a historic verdict, paving the way for a grand temple on Ramjanmabhoomi touching the sky. Modiji is solving all the problems pending in the country one by one.”Shah went on to remind people about the Modi government’s “historic” decision to revoke the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir by nullifying Articles 370 and 35A. “Congress allowed the Kashmir problem to continue for 70 years for its vote bank. The Modi government has wiped the blot off the crown of the country by abrogating these Articles,” he said.In Lohardaga, Shah promised to set up a commission to review reservation for OBCs in Jharkhand if BJP is voted back to power with full majority. Shah’s promise is being seen as an attempt to woo OBCs, which are a vote bank of BJP’s estranged ally, Ajsu Party. OBCs get 14% reservations in the state but there is a demand to increase this to 27%. Ajsu Party, which has fielded candidates in 31 seats as it is unhappy with just seven seats it has got from BJP in the alliance, has already promised to hike reservations for OBCs to 27% in its manifesto.Lohardaga, a seat reserved for STs, is one of the seats where the two allies are pitted against each other. BJP has fielded Congress turncoat and sitting MLA Sukhdeo Bhagat.In Video: Amit Shah accuses Congress for delay in Ram temple case"

NEW DELHI: Hitting back at the Congress over, the BJP said on Thursday ""the alliance of the defeated and the dejected corrupt politicians"" do not want clean, tax-paid transparent money to fund elections.""Electoral bonds brought in honest money in electoral politics. People who are revolting against electoral bonds have grown used to black money and believe in its usage during elections,"" senior BJP leader and Union minister Piyush Goyal said while addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here.On the Election Commission's recommendation, the Narendra Modi government banned cash donations above Rs 2,000, he said.Earlier today, stepping up its attack on the Union government over the electoral bonds issue, the Congress sought an inquiry by a joint parliamentary committee into these ""opaque"" donations.The party also sought an early decision on the issue by the Supreme Court on the legality of these bonds.Addressing a press conference, Congress leader Manish Tewari said the party will continue to raise the issue in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha as it considers it to be a ""threat to democracy""."

LUCKNOW: The Congress on Thursday served notices to 11 leaders in Uttar Pradesh, for “unnecessarily opposing"" the party over the revamp of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee ( UPCC ) in October.The sharply-worded notice asked them to reply to the charges against them within 24 hours. A UP Congress press release said the notices were sent by the state unit's disciplinary committee on the instructions of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh (West), and UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu.They were served notices “in view of their acts of indiscipline,” it said.The 11 leaders are mostly old-timers, disgruntled after the reorganisation of the UPCC on October 7 when Lallu replaced Raj Babbar as the state unit's president.They include an AICC member, former ministers, a district unit chief and one-time MLAs.""It has come to the notice of the disciplinary committee through newspapers that you have been continuously and unnecessarily opposing the AICC decisions concerning the UPCC publicly by holding meetings,” the notices said.“Through these meetings and statements in the media, the image of the Congress party has been tarnished. This was not expected from senior leaders like you,” they added.“This behaviour of yours is against the policies and ideas of the party .These actions come under the ambit of indiscipline. You have been given 24 hours time to give your clarification as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against you,"" they said.Earlier, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Dhiraj Gurjar told PTI in New Delhi that the party will take action if there is indiscipline, whatever the seniority of the Congress member.The move comes after the absence of several party veterans from two recent meetings called by the UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu in Lucknow.Instead, the disgruntled veterans have been holding their own meetings. They had also planned to meet party president Sonia Gandhi as a delegation to voice their grievances.Those served notices include former MP Santosh Singh, former MLC Siraj Mehdi, former ministers Ram Krishna Dwivedi and Satyadev Tripathi and AICC member Rajendra Singh Solanki.Former MLAs Bhudhar Narayan Mishra, Hafiz Mohammed Umar, Vinod Chaudhari and Nek Chand Pande, former Youth Congress leader Swayam Prakash Goswami and Gorakhpur unit president Sanjiv Singh are also on the list.The veterans felt sidelined when the new UPCC was formed by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.Some disgruntled leaders met at Siraj Mehdi's home in the first week of November.On November 14, they organised their separate programme to pay tributes to former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, instead of attending the one organised at the UPCC headquarters.Several old-timers kept away from a meeting on Wednesday of former MLAs, MLCs and MPs called by Lallu in Lucknow to discuss ways to revamp the party, which took a severe beating in the last parliamentary elections.At an earlier meeting, 75 district unit presidents were invited but only 17 turned up, he claimed.""I have no fight with anyone and have been serving in the party since the past 30 to 40 years,” Siraj Mehdi, who now faces disciplinary action, said earlier on Thursday.“In the backdrop of what we are getting to hear, we only want that our role in the party be defined,"" he told PTI.Mehdi had resigned from the membership of AICC and sent an emotional letter to Sonia Gandhi when the state unit was revamped by Priyanka Gandhi, apparently to give it a younger look.He had complained that the new UPCC gave no representation to the Shia community while claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party governments at the Centre and in UP had nominated Shias in key positions.The Congress had propped young leaders in the new UPCC, moving old warhorses like Pramod Tiwari, P L Punia and R P N Singh to an advisory council.""There are senior leaders above 60 years in the central unit who have been working relentlessly for the party. If there is any constraint on age, it should be there also. Many in the new team are not even known to us,"" another senior leader said.The revamped state unit has four vice presidents, 12 general secretaries and 24 secretaries. The team was trimmed to 67 office bearers from an unwieldy 500 earlier.Lallu had earlier said, “The Congress like a joint family and difference of opinion is natural. We have democracy in the organisation.”"

MANIKA/LOHARDAGA (JHARKHAND): Raking up the Ayodhya issue, BJP president Amit Shah on Thursday accused the Congress of stalling the case in the Supreme Court.He also alleged that the Congress party kept the Kashmir problem hanging fire for 70 years in its ""greed"" to protect its vote bank.""For so many years this judgement was not happening. We also wanted a resolution to this dispute within the framework of the Constitution. Now see how with the blessings of Lord Ram the Supreme Court has cleared the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple.""Everyone wanted a Ram temple in Ayodhya but the Congress kept stalling the case,"" Shah told election rallies in Manika and Lohardaga, as he kicked off the BJP's campaign for the Jharkhand assembly polls.He also accused the Congress of delaying a solution to the Kashmir issue for seven decades.""The Congress party left the Kashmir problem hanging fire for 70 years in its greed to protect its vote bank. Modiji (PM Narendra Modi) has erased the blot of article 370 from the crown jewel of 'Bharat Mata' and paved the way for Kashmir's development,"" he said.Emphasising the importance his party attached to the issue, Shah said the Modi government scrapped articles 370 and 35A during the very first Parliament session it faced after winning an absolute majority for a second time.The BJP president also accused the Congress-JMM combine of indulging in corruption and ""hoodwinking"" the tribals and the poor.The JMM leadership indulged in corruption of thousands of crore of rupees, while the BJP dispensation led by Raghubar Das gave a stable government and took the state forward on the path of development, he said.""JMM leader Hemant Soren should be asked which party he has aligned with, a party which hoodwinked tribals for 70 years. I would like to ask the Congress president and Rahul Gandhi to give an account of what they have done for tribals. The BJP will also give an account of the work it has done for the state,"" Shah said.He also wanted to know why the Congress failed to provide electricity, cooking gas connection, health cards, toilets and homes to the people.Shah, also the Union home minister, lauded the Raghubar Das government for ""freeing"" the state of the naxal menace, saying it was the most important achievement of the current BJP dispensation.The BJP, in its election manifesto, will promise constitution of a committee that will consider raising the percentage of reservation for the backward sections after coming to power again.""The backward sections have an important position in the social constitution of Jharkhand but they don't get reservation in proportion to their population,"" he said.Reaching out to the tribals who have a sizeable presence in the mineral-rich state, the BJP chief said the Modi government set up a museum in the memory of tribal leaders who fought valiantly for the country's freedom.He also sought to remind the electorate that it was a BJP government which created a separate state of Jharkhand for which many sacrificed their lives.""Atal ji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) created Jharkhand and Narendra Modi will embellish and spruce it up,"" he told the election rally in Manika.""People kept dying, youth sacrificed their lives, but the dream of statehood remained unfulfilled under Congress rule,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: Controversial BJP MP Pragya Thakur , accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, has been appointed to a parliamentary committee on defence, triggering a political row as the Congress on Thursday attacked the government for nominating a person charged with ""spreading terror"" to a panel tasked with defence related issues.The ruling BJP, however, strongly defended her presence in the 21-member joint consultative committee headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh and asserted that the Bhopal MP can help in ""framing right methodology"" so that innocents are not ""victimised"" the way she was by the Congress-led UPA government.Three-time chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah , who is detained in Srinagar under the stringent PSA, former defence minister and NCP leader Sharad Pawar and BJP working president J P Nadda are among the other committee members.The panel will comprise 12 members from Lok Sabha and nine from Rajya Sabha.However, it was the presence of Thakur, a first-time MP with a hardline Hindutva background and who has triggered several rows earlier with her controversial remarks, that became a lightning rod for yet another political joust involving her.She is an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, and is currently out on bail. She is facing trial for multiple charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The Congress was quick to take a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and also termed it ""unfortunate"" for the country that an MP accused of ""spreading terror"" has been nominated as member of a defence-related committee.""'Modi has not been able to forgive her from the heart' but she has been given the responsibility on important issues such as the country's defence. That is why if there is Modi, anything is possible,"" tweeted Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.After she had called Naturam Godse, who had assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, a patriot during the recent Lok Sabha polls, Modi had condemned her comments and said he would not be able to forgive her. She had also later regretted her comments.The BJP, however, strongly defended Thakur's nomination to the panel with its leader Meenakshi Lekhi, who is also a member of the committee, saying that the Bhopal MP can help in ""framing right methodology"" so that innocents are not ""victimised"" the way she was.Hitting back at the Congress, Lekhi said the party seems to have lost its faith in democracy and forgotten that Thakur is an elected member of Parliament. People know that Thakur was falsely implicated by the Congress-led UPA government, she said.The Bombay High Court granted Thakur bail on health grounds in April 2017 after the NIA dropped charges against her under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.The consultative committee also includes TMC's Sougata Roy and DMK's A Raja. Besides the 21 MPs, the committee also has Arjun Ram Meghwal and V Muraleedharan, both junior ministers for parliamentary affairs, as its ex-officio members.Thakur has often hogged headlines for her controversial statements.She was issued a show-cause notice by the BJP during the general election for her remarks on Godse.She previously earned the opposition ire when she claimed that then Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare was killed in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks due to her ""curse"".She had also attributed the deaths of Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley to 'marak shakti' (killing power) used by BJP's political adversaries."

NEW DELHI: Indicating definite progress in forming a government in Maharashtra, Congress and NCP on Wednesday jointly announced that they will form a “stable” government.The NCP-Congress deliberations came in the wake of moves to form a coalition government with the Shiv Sena, which walked out of its pre-poll pact with BJP after the election results over the issue of splitting the chief minister’s term and a 50:50 share of ministerial berths.The announcement came after a three-hour meeting at the residence of NCP chief Sharad Pawar focusing on finalising a “common minimum programme” to run the alliance government.Nawab Malik of NCP and former CM Prithviraj Chavan of Congress, who addressed a press conference, did not name the Sena even as they said the three parties will have to join hands to form the government. Chavan said they were hopeful of ending the political uncertainty even as a few issues remained to be discussed.The development could bolster the Sena camp, which has been waiting for letters of support from NCP and Congress. “All matters should be sorted out in a couple of days. We could approach the governor by Saturday if things go as planned,” a senior Sena leader said.Sena sources said concerns in Congress quarters about the need to iron out approaches to issues like NRC and the Citizenship Amendment Bill were not insurmountable as the more contentious Article 370 and Ayodhya were out of the way. They said the alliance under consideration was Maharashtra-centric and did not impinge on the national scenario.The debate in Congress has seen some leaders, notably veteran A K Antony, warn of the fallout of a pact with Sena. A delegation of IUML made the point when it called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday and said the approach to the Ayodhya verdict needed to be nuanced — even though the Kerala outfit initially welcomed it. There is, however, a strong view in Congress that BJP must be stopped from forming a government in Maharashtra.Present in the meeting at Pawar’s house were senior Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jairam Ramesh and K C Venugopal, besides Maharashtra’s Chavan and Naseem Khan.They drove to Pawar’s residence straight after a meeting with Sonia, a clear indication that the party chief had given her final nod for the alliance. NCP was represented by Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, among others.This was the first formal announcement that a three-way alliance of Congress-NCP and the Shiv Sena would form the government. Till now, claims of the unlikely coalition had come from either NCP or state leaders.The CMP was being finalised till late in the night. Sources said the sticking point was the bid to reconcile the platform for coming together of “secular” and “Hindutva” forces.Given the deadlock, sources said a formulation on the lines that the government would “work under the preamble of the Constitution” was proposed. The compromise would have to be cleared by the Congress chief and Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray.In Video: Stable govt in Maharashtra soon: Congress-NCP"

MALAPPURAM: A high level delegation of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) led by its national president Kader Mohideen and its national office bearers, P K Kunhalikutty, MP, E T Mohammed Basheer MP, Nawas Khani MP and Khurram Anis Omer called on the Congress president and chairperson of UPA Sonia Gandhi, seeking joint effort from UPA to consolidate secular forces to fight BJP’s “agenda of suppression of minorities and Dalits”.At the meeting the party leaders urged Gandhi that UPA under the leadership of Indian National Congress should take lead in consolidating the secular forces under an umbrella with common agenda of “saving the country from the nefarious designs of the communal forces and to set agenda for the formation of a secular government at the Centre.""In a press note issued after the meeting, IUML alleged that the BJP government at the Centre has been implementing an agenda of suppression of the depressed and oppressed classes of the society – Dalits and minorities, and spreading fear psychosis among the weaker sections of the society. The government is ignoring the backward community particularly the minorities in governance and treated them as secondary citizens of this country, it alleged .The legislation brought in and passed by the BJP government, such as Triple Talaaq, are only to weaken the fundamental rights of the people and clear interference in their personal laws. It is against their rights as enshrined in the constitution, the party alleged.Party termed the Ayodhya verdict issued by supreme court as disappointing. “The verdict has no clarity on various issues. The community is much agitated in their minds of being ignored and is gearing up to file a review on the verdict,"" it said.Clarifying stand on Kashmir issue, the party said that the people of Kashmir are subjected to mental torture and human rights violation. “They are treated as intruders at their homes. Freedom of life as enshrined in Constitution is snatched away from the people of Kashmir”, the press note says."

GUWAHATI: Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said the state government has requested the centre to reject the recently published National Register of Citizens (NRC).Addressing a press conference here, the senior BJP leader said even the party has urged Union home minster Amit Shah to dismiss the NRC in the current form.""The Assam government has not accepted the NRC. Government of Assam and BJP have requested the home minister to reject the NRC,"" he added.Sarma said the state government favoured one national NRC with one cut-off year for the entire country.""If the cut-off year is 1971, then it should be the same for all states ... We are not asking to scrap the Assam Accord,"" he added.Strongly criticising the earlier NRC state coordinator Prateek Hajela , the minister alleged that the entire exercise of updation was carried out keeping aside the state government.""But the entire nation thinks that NRC was updated by the Assam government. We are bearing the brunt because of one individual. We are concerned with the flaws in the system.""The way Hajela ran the show under a different eco-system, it has created a multiple layer of questions. As a public representative, we are unable to answer them now,"" Sarma said."

SAGARDIGHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee assured people that she will never allow NRC in the state even as Union home ministersaid a citizen's list on the lines of the exercise in Assam will be carried out across the country.The TMC supremo sought answers from the BJP over exclusion of 14 lakh Hindus and Bengalis from the final NRC list in Assam.""There are few people, who are trying to create disturbance in the state in the name of implementation of NRC. I want to make it very clear, we will never allow NRC in Bengal ""No one can take away your citizenship and turn you into a refugee. There can be no division on the basis of religion,"" Banerjee said while addressing a public meeting here.Before talking about implementing NRC in West Bengal, the BJP should answer why 14 lakhs Hindus and Bengalis were omitted from the final NRC list in Assam, she said.The proposed implementation of the citizen's list or the National Register of Citizens in Bengal has created panic claiming 11 lives in the state following the omission of about 19.6 lakh names from the final NRC list in Assam."

NEW DELHI: The NRC process will be carried out across India, Home Minister Amit Shah said in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday while making it clear that there would be no discrimination on the basis of religion.Shah said the Government accepts that refugees - Hindu, Buddhists, Jain, Christians, Sikhs and Parsis - who left Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan due to religious atrocities should get Indian citizenship.""The process of National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be carried out across the country. No one irrespective of their religion should be worried.

NEW DELHI: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday afternoon in Parliament to discuss issues related to farmers distress in Maharashtra According to NCP leaders, Pawar will meet Modi in Parliament at 12.30 pm to discuss several issues related to the state, especially the agrarian crisis following unprecedented rainfall.The meeting of the two leaders comes two days after Modi praised the Sharad Pawar-led party during his speech in Rajya Sabha on Monday.Speaking on the occasion of 250th Session of the Upper House, Modi said other parties, including the BJP, should learn from the NCP and Biju Janata Dal of Naveen Patnaik how to adhere to parliamentary norms.The praise for the Pawar-led party comes at a time when the NCP and Congress are trying to keep the BJP away from power in Maharashtra, where the President's rule was imposed on November 12.The BJP and the Shiv Sena fought the Assembly elections for the 288 member House, and they bagged 105 and 56 seats, respectively. However, the alliance came undone after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackarey demanded rotational chief ministerial post -- a request denied by the BJP.On the other hand, the Congress and the NCP won 44 and 54 seats, respectively in the state.Several senior leaders of Congress and NCP are also set to meet during the day to discuss the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) for Maharashtra and to forge an alliance with Shiv Sena possibly to form government in the state.In Video: NCP Chief Sharad Pawar to meet PM Modi to discuss Maha agrarian crisis"

MUMBAI: Senior leaders of the Congress and NCP will meet at NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s residence in New Delhi on Wednesday to discuss government formation with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra . A Congress leader told TOI that notwithstanding Pawar’s surprising claim on Monday that he had not discussed the Sena or government formation in his meeting with Sonia Gandhi , a new government of the Congress, NCP and Sena may be installed in the last week of November or the first week of December.Sources said Congress MLAs in Maharashtra are planning to write to their party’s central leadership seeking an early decision on joining a non-BJP coalition.The meeting at Pawar’s residence will be attended by NCP’s Ajit Pawar, Praful Patel , Sunil Tatkare, Chhagan Bhujbal and Jayant Patil, while the Congress will be represented by Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, Prithviraj Chavan , Ashok Chavan and state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat.The Congress leader said that on Tuesday,with her colleagues Kharge, A K Antony and K C Venugopal to discuss the political situation in Maharashtra following her meeting with Pawar. “The discussion centered around government formation with the Sena and the power-sharing formula,” he said.A senior NCP leader said the Congress and NCP have already discussed their plan with Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut and think “it must have been brought to the attention of Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.”The NCP leader said it has been agreed in principle to grant the CM’s post to the Sena for the entire five-year term, while the Congress and NCP will each get the deputy CM’s post for five years. A call on sharing of portfolios will be taken once the final decision on government formation is made, the leader added.The NCP leader said it has been made clear to the Congress that it must join the new government in order to give it stability. “At the moment, Uddhav Thackeray is the top contender for the CM’s post, while the NCP’s Ajit Pawar and Congress’ Ashok Chavan are vying for the deputy CM’s post,” he said.The Sena, for its part, has called a meeting of all its 56 MLAs at Thackeray’s Matoshree residence on Friday. Sources said the MLAs have been asked to get their PAN and Aadhar cards along for the meeting, which means they may be moved to a hotel for a few days to prevent possible horse-trading.President’s rule was imposed in Maharashtra on November 12 after the Sena decided not to join hands with its long-time ally BJP for government formation and no party came forward to stake claim. After that, Pawar held a meeting with Congress leader Ahmed Patel, and after Uddhav Thackeray subsequently met both Pawar and Ahmed Patel, the Congress and NCP agreed in principle to form the government with the Sena.In Video: Soon best ideal govt will be form in Maha under helm of Shiv Sena: Sanjay Raut"

BENGALURU: Senior JD(S) leader Basavaraj Horatti on Tuesday reaffirmed that there are ""all chances"" that his party may support the B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government, if it falls short of numbers after the December 5 bypoll results.The MLC who met the chief minister felt that MLAs across political parties do not want mid-term polls.""Kumaraswamy and Deve Gowda have said. On the basis of their statement I have said in case the BJP falls short of numbers there are all chances that JD (S) may support until his three-and-half year term ends, I still stand by it,"" Horatti said.He said, no MLA from the three political parties -- the BJP, the Congress and JD(S) -- are ready to pull down the government as no one wants mid-term polls.""Let any government be in power, our MLA post should remain for remaining three-and-half years, is the feeling among MLAs ... "" he added.In what is being perceived as JD(S) softening of stand on the BJP, JD(S) patriarch-- not wanting mid-term polls in Karnataka -- had said he wants the government to complete its term as it would give him time to build his party.His son and former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy too had recently said JD(S) would not try to dislodge the government.Fifteen out of 17 assembly constituencies represented by disqualified Congress-JD(S) legislators, whose resignation and absence from trust vote had led to the collapse of the Kumaraswamy-led coalition government and paved way for the BJP to come to power in July, will go to bypolls on December 5.Thein 13 constituencies, will need to win at least six seats to remain in power.Horatti said he had come to meet chief minister on some work.""I had some work with the chief minister, I used to meet other chief ministers also like Siddaramaiah and Kumaraswamy for work earlier. In the same way I'm meeting Yediyurappa . He is chief minister for the whole state not only for the BJP,"" he said.Horatti, who was leading a group of disgruntled JD(S) MLCs and had aired their ire at being ""completely neglected"" by the party leadership, said all issues have been sorted out during the recent meeting with the leadership.""Our disgruntlement was that we were not taken care properly during the coalition government, leadership accepted it and they said they will rectify the mistake and asked us to forget things that have gone by, and there it ends. When children cry, they are shown chocolate and they become quiet, our problems are also like that,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said: ""It needs 100 births"" to understand what Nationalist Congress Party President Sharad Pawar says.The Sena MP was replying to a question on the NCP chief's virtual about-turn on the question of Maharashtra government formation by three parties — Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP — on Monday at a media briefing at his residence in the national capital.""You don't worry about Pawar and our alliance. Very soon, by early-December, a Shiv Sena-led alliance government will be in power in Maharashtra. It will be a stable government,"" Raut said.He said that there are no doubts in the Sena on the government formation, ""but it is the media which is harbouring confusion over it"".On Pawar, Raut said he had discussed the condition of Maharashtra farmers with the NCP chief on Monday night.""What's wrong if (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi had praised Pawar? Earlier, Modi had publicly admitted that Pawar is his political 'guru'. So, don't read any politics in this,"" Raut said.Taking a swipe at its former ally, he said that by snapping ties with Sena, the Bharatiya Janata Party has lost its oldest and biggest ally.""It was Sena which built up the BJP in Maharashtra, gave them seats and accommodated them always. But, now the BJP has changed the seating arrangements of Sena MPs in Parliament and they will pay for it,"" Raut said.He said in the recent past, Sena was reluctant for an alliance with the BJP, but ""it came about only because BJP President Amit Shah landed in Sena President Uddhav Thackeray's residence 'Matoshri' and raised the issue of partnership in the state"".The Sena-BJP had fought the Lok Sabha and later the assembly elections together.However, in the assembly elections, the Sena insisted on the post of CM to it and also on equitable power-sharing, but the BJP rejected the Sena arguments.The Sena is currently negotiating an alliance with Congress-NCP even as it has been allotted seating in the opposition benches."

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Tuesday likened its one-time ally BJP to 13th century invader Muhammad Ghori who killed Prithviraj Chauhan despite the legendary king sparing his life several times.In a hard-hitting editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said it would ""uproot"" the BJP as the latter had dared to ""challenge us"", claiming the ruling party's ""leaders were kids"" when the Sena's support helped form the NDA.The two parties, which fought assembly polls together in Maharashtra and came up with 161 seats jointly in the 288-member House, fell out on the sharing of the chief minister's post and have since been attacking each other.The Sena is in talks with the Congress and the NCP currently to form a non-BJP government in the Maharashtra.In the editorial, the Sena said, ""Muhammad of Ghor, said to have laid the foundation of Islamic rule in India, fought several battles with Hindu king Prithviraj Chauhan and the latter always spared him (after defeat). But when the invader won a battle, he killed Prihtviraj Chauhan.""""Even in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena has spared such ungrateful people several times and now they are trying to back-stab us,"" the editorial said, without mentioning the BJP by name.The editorial also lashed out at Sena being allotted seats on the opposition side in both houses of Parliament, as announced by Union parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi on Sunday.Joshi had said the decision was made as the Sena's minister - Arvind Sawant - had resigned from the Union government and the party was ""working out"" an alliance with the Congress and the NCP to form the government in Maharashtra.""Who decided our sitting arrangement when there was no meeting of the NDA held for the same? Earlier, Lal Krishna Advani was the chief of the NDA and George Fernandes was its convener. Who is the chief and convener of the NDA today?"" the Sena asked in the editorial.It also asked if other constituents of the NDA were informed before the Sena was shown the door, claiming such decisions were earlier taken after all parties arrived at a consensus.The party pointed out that the date chosen to move the Sena to the opposition benches coincided with the seventh death anniversary of party founder Bal Thackeray (November 17).""This haste will result in some serious accident for sure,"" the editorial warned.""It is the beginning of the end of politics of arrogance. We promise you we will uproot you one day as you have challenged us. The heads of the party (BJP) today would have been kids when the Sena supported the BJP to form the National Democratic Alliance,"" it said.The tirade continued with the editorial questioning whether the BJP had sought permission from the NDA before allying with Mehbooba Mufti 's PDP in Jammu and Kashmir earlier or with Nitish Kumar's JD(U), despite it being well known that the Bihar chief minister had severely criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi"

NEW DELHI: The opening day of Parliament saw Congress voicing its concerns over the government's decision to revoke SPG cover to Congress president Sonia Gandhi , former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.During Question Hour, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue and attacked the ruling government for its pettiness and demanded that the security detail be reinstated.A section of Congress MPs led by Manicka Tagore also decided to petition the President of India and to seek his ""intervention and support"" in reinstating SPG security. Over 40 Lok Sabha MPs signed the letter on Monday and the numbers are expected to rise with Rajya Sabha MPs supporting the cause.Speaking to TOI , Congress general secretary organisation K C Venugopal said party leaders are ""alarmed and concerned"" by the prevailing laxity in security. ""It is shocking that BJP is seeking to take political advantage out of something as essential as security. Security at the entrance of our leaders' house is lax. Even the vehicles they were using have been replaced by over 10-year-old cars .In Parliament, where everyone has access to corridors, Congress president was left unescorted, since her personal security officer is not permitted beyond the main building,"" Venugopal said .While SPG was incharge of overall security for the Gandhis, the Z Plus security detail is now divided between the Delhi Police and CRPF, with the former handling access and reception, and the latter taking care of close protection and the leaders' houses. ""Our concern for their security is because both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were assassinated as a result of security lapses,"" Venugopal said.""One year ago, IB had said Rahul Gandhi was facing threats at the hands of Khalistanis and Naxals. What happened to that threat now? We never played with their security. But since writing to the PM or home minister is pointless because they are party to the decision, we plan to take it to the President,"" Tagore said."

NEW DELHI: BJP's oldest ally-turned-foe Shiv Sena , after having severed ties with the NDA over government formation in Maharashtra , played its new role in the opposition benches to the hilt on Monday as Parliament opened for the winter session.Lok Sabha, where Sena's sitting arrangement redrew the line between the opposition and the treasury benches, saw the 18-member contingent in the well several times, shouting slogans against the government. The MPs were demanding relief for farmers in Maharashtra and joined other opposition parties in protesting National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah 's absence due to detention.The regional party also demanded that the government stop attacking the opposition and foisting false charges on their leaders. In Rajya Sabha too, Sena MPs had their seats re-allocated. They signed up with opposition Congress, Trinamool Congress, Left parties, SP, RJD, AAP and others to submit notices for short duration discussion on slowdown in the economy.One of the notices was given by TMC and the other by Congress. Sena's Sanjay Raut was one of the signatories seeking a discussion on ""the grave economic crisis in India and how to improve the situation"". The discussion will include issues like ""present economic conditions, hiding government data and disinvestment"", TMC's leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O'Brien said.Sena MPs, after demanding relief for farmers in Maharashtra, walked out of the House in Lok Sabha."

COOCHBEHAR: Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee , in a first ever, brought changes in her rhetoric against BJP and warned people against “minority extremism.” Without naming the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) Mamata at a Trinamool workers’ meet in Coochbehar said: “I am watching that there are some extremists among the minorities. They have their base in Hyderabad. Don’t listen to them.”Minutes after workers’ meet the chief minister went to the Madan Mohan Temple in Coochbehar to offer her prayers before she went to the Rash Mela on the Rajbari gorunds. Mamata’s offering the puja at Madan Mohan Temple comes six days after BJP’s Coochbehar MP Nisith Pramanik came in a grand procession to the temple last Tuesday, performed the puja, spinned the Rash Chakra and offered gifts to the temple.Political observers reading Mamata’s comment against “minority extremism” and her offering prayers at Madan Mohan Temple together held that the ruling Trinamool is desperate to win over the Hindu votes, both Bengali and Rajbanshi, who hold the key in Coochbehar. At the moment Trinamool has made dents into the Rajbanshi community but is yet to win over the Bengali refugee votes.“I appeal to the Trinamool leaders to close ranks and take up challenge against BJP. Our activists are the party’s assets. I would ask you not to work for groups under leaders. Work for the flag you hold. There should be an end to Trinamool leaders making comments against each other. The party is not going to swallow the poison they spit. I am happy that Trinamool MLAs, councillors are working together as a team now. The party wouldn’t have lost seats if they did it earlier,” the Trinamool chief said.Mamata then warned the Trinamool gathering against the BJP’s bid to reassure the Hindu refugees that they are all safe under the proposed Citizenship Amendment Bill. “CAB is a hoax. It struck them after 19 lakh Bengalis, non-Bengalis, Gorkhas in Assam could not make it to the final NRC list. Now they are talking of the CAB when people under the CAB will be treated as non-citizens for six years,” the CM said. “You have already got your names enrolled in the voter’s list. Your sons and daughters are going to schools. You are all enjoying the benefits of various state schemes. What else do you need to apply for citizenship afresh?” the CM said.Calling BJP, Congress and CPM Jagai, Madhai and Gadai, Mamata said: “The CPM harmads have now joined BJP to become ostads. The leaders of Congress and CPM are taking anti-BJP stance in Delhi. But when it comes to Bengal they are all cobbling up against Trinamool.”In Video: Mamata Banerjee slams Centre over Citizenship Amendment Bill"

NEW DELHI: Amid indications of cautious progress in talks between Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) over government formation in Maharashtra Sharad Pawar sprang a surprise by claiming he did not discuss alliance with Shiv Sena or government formation in the state with Sonia Gandhi during his 45-minute meeting with the Congress chief on Monday evening.The NCP boss visited 10, Janpath for a discussion with the Congress president, in what had been billed as a crucial moment for government formation. Talking to reporters after the meeting in which Congress leader A K Antony was also present, Pawar made the surprise claim that a coalition with Sena was not on the table. “We did not discuss government formation with any party. We just discussed numbers, who has how many. We will keep an eye on the situation,” he added.The NCP chief said he would talk about the political situation with smaller allies like Peasants and Workers Party, Shetkari Sangathan and Samajwadi Party , who were angry at not being involved, calling it the only “new development in the old situation”.Significantly, Sena leader Sanjay Raut met Pawar after the latter’s meeting with Sonia.Pawar’s refusal to indulge queries about alliance with Sena was baffling as just two days ago, he said in Nagpur a government in the state would be formed by NCP, Congress and Sena, which would run for its full term.Reacting to his latest remarks, a senior Congress leader said, “I am surprised by Pawar’s statement.”Significantly, in a statement issued before Pawar talked to reporters, Congress had said, “Sharad Pawar met the Congress president today and briefed her on the situation in Maharashtra. It was decided that in a day or two, representatives from NCP and Congress will meet in Delhi to discuss the way forward.”Pawar’s remarks coincide with the assessment that developments unspooling in Maharashtra have strengthened the Maratha warhorse’s position, enhancing the advantage he gained by leading his NCP to a better-than-expected performance, BJP’s sub-par show and its break-up with Sena. In contrast, Sena’s exit from the NDA without a countervailing arrangement with NCP-Congress may have weakened its hand, rendering it vulnerable to even stronger bargaining from NCP.Congress may have also gained but not as much as Pawar, who is leading the negotiations and has come to the table with the aura of an odd-defying survivor. He seems to be having a better grasp than others of the flux, at least since November 11 when he, in another surprise move, did not underwrite Sena’s claim of majority support.Congress’s fear that its members may bolt if it ends up on the opposition benches yet again can also be advantageous to NCP.Pawar’s curious turn came even as the potential partners appeared to be making cautious progress towards hashing out a common minimum programme. Congress, which unlike NCP is more sensitive about getting into a political clinch with the hardline Hindutva outfit, has been keen that Sena smoothen its sharp ideological edges: its anxiety reflected by Antony’s presence during Sonia’s deliberations with Pawar.Given that they hail from rival political spectrums of ‘Hindutva’ and ‘secularism’, the expectation is that divergence in their stance on critical issues should be minimum. While Ayodhya and Article 370 are already out of the way, sensitive subjects like Uniform Civil Code and Citizenship Amendment Bill are still in discussion and could erupt if not blunted beforehand.Though the concerns are obvious, sources said the feedback from discussions over the last few days was that the parties had narrowed their differences. A study of Sena’s state manifesto, too, is seen as bereft of any future flashpoints, which can facilitate the way for a common minimum programme.Asked if it was a positive sign that Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was learnt to have dropped the idea of visiting Ayodhya which he had announced earlier, Pawar shot back, “Do I decide where Uddhav Thackeray has to go?”In Video: No talk about government formation at meet with Congress: NCP chief Sharad Pawar"

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday alleged that the Modi government had overruled the RBI to introduce electoral bonds to enable ""black money to enter the BJP coffers"" and demanded that the scheme be scrapped immediately.Describing it as ""opaque"" and promoting "" money laundering "", the party also demanded that the names of those who bought these bonds be made public and asked what the ""quid pro quo"" was.Attacking the government over the issue, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, ""In 'New' India, bribes and illegal commissions are called electoral bonds.""Citing media reports and RTI responses, the opposition party alleged that the government asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for its opinion just days before unveiling electoral bonds, but dismissed the central bank's reservations and objections.Congress spokesperson and MP Rajeev Gowda alleged that the government seeking the RBI's nod just ahead of the unveiling shows it was done in a ""perfunctory"" manner and the central bank's reservations were dismissed in haste.Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also attacked the government on the issue, alleging that electoral bonds were ""cleared by bypassing RBI"" and ""dismissing"" national security concerns in order to enable black money to enter the BJP coffers.""It appears that while the BJP was elected on the promise of eradicating black money it was busy lining ... its own pockets with exactly that! What a shameful betrayal of the Indian people,"" she said on Twitter.Addressing a press conference, Gowda termed the electoral bond scheme ""fraudulent"" and claimed that it eliminates a level-playing field.""It is a fraud on the people of India. It is a fraud on the electoral process. It eliminates the level playing field that needs to be there in a true democracy. It brings in opacity and this opacity was objected to by the Election Commission of India,"" the Congress MP said.He alleged that the government brought the scheme as a money bill so that changes cannot be made in it in the Rajya Sabha.""The Congress has opposed the electoral bond scheme because it lacks transparency, it lacks fairness ... we demand that the BJP government, if it has nothing to hide, must reveal the entities who have bought the bonds and to what extent,"" Gowda said.""We demand that the BJP government explain to the people of India what policy favours, including the selling of public assets to crony capitalists, have taken place as a result of electoral bond transactions,"" he said.The Congress also demands the immediate scrapping of the electoral bond scheme which even the RBI and the EC have questioned because it is opaque and is a ""money laundering scheme"", Gowda added.""We demand an inquiry into how the finance ministry took decisions to overrule the RBI to establish this corruption-inducing scheme and we urge the government to come clean,"" he said.Gowda alleged that electoral bonds worth at least Rs 6,000 crore have been sold since March 2018 and the BJP has garnered more than 95 per cent of the money.On the receipt of electoral bonds by the Congress, Gowda said, ""We have not asked for (it). our party has received electoral bonds of about Rs 500 crore out of a total of Rs 6,000 crore most of which has gone to the BJP.""Asked if the Congress is going to raise this issue in the ongoing Parliament session, Gowda answered in the affirmative.""Obviously, this is the issue that has just come and more is expected to come up in the next few days,"" he added.Earlier, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also cited a media report to allege that the government ""overruled"" the RBI on the issue of introducing electoral bonds.""RTI reveals how 'electoral bonds' became instruments of anonymous donations bordering on opaque 'money laundering',"" Surjewala said in a tweet.""Will the Modi govt answer -- 1. How many thousand crores of bonds issued? 2. How many thousand crores received by BJP? 3. The 'Quid Pro Quo'?"" he asked."

NEW DELHI: Speaking on the 250th session of the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Modi praised the NCP, a party that has emerged as a kingmaker in Maharashtra , sparking speculation amid the political deadlock in the state. The PM praised NCP and BJD for deciding to stay away from the well of the House.Calling the Upper House ""eternal"", Prime Minister Modi stressed the significance of the House. From mentioning abrogation of Article 370 to triple talaq Bill, Modi highlighted how ""historic"" the House has been.Praising the Rajya Sabha, he said it was the House's maturity that ensured the Bill on Triple Talaq and the one on GST were passed, in spite of opposition to it.Mentioning abrogation of Article 370, Modi said, ""Whenever it has been about national good, the Rajya Sabha has risen to the occasion and made a strong contribution.""We can never forget the role of the Rajya Sabha when Bills pertaining to Articles 370 and 35(A) were passed. This House has worked to further the unity of the counrty.""Taking a subtle dig at opposition, he said, ""It was believed that the Bill on Triple Talaq would not pass here, but it did."" The BJP-led NDA lacked the numbers in the Upper House, yet the House was able to pass it. PM Modi called the Rajya Sabha as the ""supporting house"", stressing the important role it plays to keep ""checks and balances"". Taking about cooperative Centre-state relationship, he saisd, ""Our Constitution inspires us to work for a welfare state. It also motivates us to work for the welfare of states. The Rajya Sabha, as the Council of States, enables us to further the spirit of cooperative federalism .""But in a statement that is likely to be seen from political prism, the PM praised the NCP and BJD for taking a stated position to stay away from the well in Parliament. He said, ""Today I want to appreciate two parties, NCP and BJD. These parties have wonderfully adhered to parliamentary norms. They have never ventured into the well. They have made their points very effectively. Much can be learned from these practices.""The comment assumes significance as BJP in spite of getting 105 seats is not being able to form government in Maharashtra and the NCP appears to be the kingmakers."

NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: Ahead of Nationalist Congress Party supremo Sharad Pawar 's meeting with Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi , the former on Monday said in Maharashtra the BJP and Shiv Sena had fought the elections together and ""they have to choose their paths"".Speaking to media in Parliament, Pawar said, ""The BJP-Shiv Sena fought together, we (NCP) and Congress fought together in the elections. They have to choose their path and we will do our politics.""He said he will meet Sonia Gandhi later in the day at her residence.Congress sources said in the meeting the heads of the NCP and Congress are likely to discuss the next course of action in politically fractured Maharashtra where President's rule was imposed last Tuesday after Shiv Sena parted ways with the BJP and failed to persuade the Governor on government formation. The largest party, BJP, had already expressed its inability to form the government. Pawar and Sonia Gandhi would discuss prospects of an alliance with the ideologically opposite Shiv Sena.Party sources said Congress and NCP, the pre-poll alliance partners, are working on the common minimum programme (CMP) with the Shiv Sena for the government formation.Congress sources said that before saying yes to the alliance, the party wants Shiv Sena to shed its hardline Hindutva ideology and take a secular stand on several issues.He also said the NCP wants the Congress to be part of the government.Pre-poll allies BJP and Shiv Sena contested the October 21 Assembly polls together. The BJP bagged 105 out of 288 seats while Shiv Sena managed to win 56 seats. However, the alliance fell apart after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackarey demanded rotational chief ministerial post, a demand denied by the BJP.On the other hand, the Congress and the NCP won 44 and 54 seats, respectively in the state.In Video: Maharashtra crisis: BJP-Sena must choose their path, says Sharad Pawar"

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MPs are being allotted seats on the opposition side in both houses of Parliament as its minister has resigned and the party is ""working out"" alliance with the Congress and NCP to form government in Maharashtra, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said on Sunday.Arvind Sawant, the lone Sena minister in the Union council of ministers submitted his resignation last Monday. The party said on Saturday that it would not attend a meeting of NDA constituents on the eve of the winter session of Parliament.""Shiv Sena's minister has resigned from the NDA government… they are not attending today's NDA meeting and working out alliance with the Congress and the NCP. So it is natural that they will be allotted seats on the opposition side in both houses,"" Joshi told reporters after the all-party meeting.According to sources, all the three Shiv Sena MPs in the Rajya Sabha have been allocated seats on the opposition side, while in the Lok Sabha it is yet to be done.The decades-old alliance between the Shiv Sena and BJP turned sour after the former pressed for the demand of sharing the chief ministerial post in Maharashtra. It is now holding parleys with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress to form a non-BJP government in the state."

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena alleged on Saturday that the BJP now exuding confidence of forming government in Maharashtra, after backing off initially, makes its intention of horse-trading under the guise of President's rule evident. In its mouthpiece Saamana, Sena also hit out at former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis over his remark that the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance won't last beyond six months, saying the new political equation was giving ""stomach ache to several people"".Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had on Friday said that they will, claiming that his party can count on support of 119 MLAs in the 288-member assembly.""Those with 105 seats had earlier conveyed to the governor that they do not have the majority. How come are they now claiming that only they will form the government?"" Sena said in Saamana.""...the intention of horse-trading stand exposed now. The lies of those promising transparent governance are becoming evident now,"" it said, adding that ""unethical"" ways do not suit the tradition of the state.Maharashtra has been under President's rule since Tuesday after no party or alliance staked claim to form government or conveyed support of adequate number of MLAs to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari The Sena reached out to the Congress-NCP combine for government formation after its demand for sharing the chief minister's post and equal distribution of portfolios was rejected by the BJP, its pre-poll ally.The BJP and the Sena, which fought the October 21 polls in alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the 288-member assembly.The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats, respectively.Referring to Union minister Nitin Gadkari's Friday comment in which he alluded to cricket, the Shiv Sena said, ""Gadkari is not related to cricket. He is related to cement, ethanol, asphalt and other things.""On Friday, the Union minister of road transport and highways had likened politics with cricket, saying ""anything"" could happen in both the fields as those who appear to be losing the match might actually win the game.The Shiv Sena said that cricket has become more of a business than a game now.There is ""horse-trading and fixing"" in cricket too, it alleged.""Hence, the suspicion is always there whether it is the game that wins or the fixing (in cricket). Hence, Gadkari likening Maharashtra politics to the romantic game of cricket is apt,"" it said."

MUMBAI: A day after being discharged from hospital following angioplasty, Shiv Sena ’s Sanjay Raut was back in action on Thursday, asking Amit Shah to introspect on what transpired between him and Uddhav Thackeray behind closed doors in Matoshree and accusing him of not keeping PM Modi in the loop.“Shah is raising the point now when the election is over, which is not ethical,” said Raut. He pointed out it was Modi who had portrayed Fadnavis as the next CM, not Shah. Blaming Shah for not keeping Modi in the loop about the poll pact decided at Matoshree before the LS polls earlier in the year, he added: “Modi would have intervened if he would have been aware of the fact.” He told the media there is some “invisible power” that does not wish good relations between Uddhav and Modi.Raut also criticised BJP for the political impasse in the state, quoting a dialogue from a popular TV serial: “Daya, kuchh toh gadbad hai.”The Saamna editorial explained that if the governor cannot give even 48 hours to form government in a state like Maharashtra , people would think, “Daya, kuchh toh gadbad hai”. Imposition of President’s rule had played out like a planned script...like some “invisible power” was playing a game."

MUMBAI: A 40-point common minimum programme (CMP) was finalised by Shiv Sena NCP and Congress on Thursday in the first concrete step towards government formation. It will now be shared with the chiefs of the three parties, who will confer over the weekend and the final blueprint is expected by November 19.With the draft CMP wrapped up, attention has turned to power sharing, and a broad consensus seems to be emerging on Sena getting 16 cabinet members, NCP 14 and Congress 12. The Speaker is likely to be from Congress, and will get a deputy from Sena, while the legislative council chairman’s post will go to NCP, with the deputy’s chair, again, for Sena.The top posts seem to be far from decided. A senior Congress leader said: “Shiv Sena has staked claim for the CM’s post. It is not yet clear if it will be for five years or it will be by rotation for two and half years, or it should be for an equal period among Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP.” Stressing that all posts and cabinet berths will be decided by consensus, the leader added that a decision on deputy CM will be taken after deliberations among senior leaders of all three parties.As efforts for government formation seemed to pick up momentum in Mumbai, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court, alleging that the change in Sena’s stand, which had fought the polls with BJP, was “nothing but betrayal of people’s trust reposed in the NDA”. It may be listed for hearing in the next few days. In the tri-party camp, the mood was upbeat. “We are determined to provide a stable, non-BJP government as people of Maharashtra do not want a mid-term poll,’’ said Congress’ Vijay Wadettiwar.Talking about the draft CMP, former Congress CM Prithviraj Chavan told TOI: “We took note of Shiv Sena’s manifesto as well as our own manifesto and drafted the CMP. It is not an election manifesto, but an action plan for providing clean and transparent administration. Contentious issues have been dropped.”On Thursday, Sena president Uddhav Thackeray first held a meeting with Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat and NCP’s Jayant Patil on the CMP. It was followed by a joint meeting of senior Congress and NCP leaders, and later in the evening, Congress, NCP and Sena leaders met to finalise the draft CMP at the office of Chhagan Bhujbal’s MET education trust. Congress leaders Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde, Manikrao Thakre and Wadettiwar, NCP’s Jayant Patil, Nawab Malik and Bhujbal, and Sena’s Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai were present.Chavan, Malik and Shinde said the draft will be submitted to Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray in a day or two. The three are expected to jointly deliberate on the contents and finalise the document by Sunday. Once approved, Uddhav may meet Pawar on Sunday itself, and subsequently, they are likely to meet Sonia in New Delhi on November 19. “We feel that once the final document is ready, Pawar, Thackeray and Gandhi will meet in New Delhi to finalise the future course of action, particularly formation of government and power sharing,” said a senior Congress leader.Though Maharashtra is under President’s rule, the situation is quite different from the time election results were announced three weeks ago when Sena snubbed BJP. Following the intervention of Sena MP Sanjay Raut, Uddhav had knocked on Pawar’s doors. After several rounds of discussion, Pawar took the lead on government formation with a brand new political construct by speaking to Sonia. Her trusted aide Ahmed Patel was deputed for negotiations, and it led to the draft.In Video: Final call early next week, Congress-NCP, Shiv Sena finalise draft CMP"

KOLKATA: A fresh war of words erupted between the West Bengal governor and the state government on Thursday with Jagdeep Dhankhar, the incumbent at the Raj Bhavan saying politics over distribution of relief in areas hit by Cyclone Bulbul hurts democracy.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee responded sharply saying that a person occupying the gubernatorial post should not try to run a parallel administration.Dhankhar's comment comes a day after BJP criticised the Trinamool Congress government for politicising the relief work. Union Minister Babul Supriyo had on Wednesday faced massive protests during his visit to cyclone-affected areas.""All agencies are working ... (It is) Time is (that) agencies must come forward, the government must come forward and NGOs also must come forward for those who have (suffered) loss of property or life ... I am all for it. I do not want any politics,"" Dhankhar told reporters here.""I urge people not to do politics. The moment you put politics into governance it will somewhere damage the fabric of democracy,"" he added.Dhankhar and BJP's remarks drew sharp reactions from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who without naming either the governor or the saffron party said those who are trying to politicise the issue should refrain from doing so and try to provide relief to the people.""It was a big cyclone. Instead of standing by the affected people, some are playing politics and indulging in vandalism. I would urge them to refrain from it. This is not the time to do politics,"" she said.In a veiled reference to Dhankhar, the chief minister said those holding constitutional posts have become BJP mouthpieces and those who are ""playing dirty games"" should stop it.Banerjee's comment came when she was asked by scribes about her reaction to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's recommendation for imposition of President's Rule in the state.A few people (governors) are acting just like BJP mouthpieces. In my state too, you have seen what is going on -- they want to run a parallel administration,"" she said. West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh extending support to Dhankhar said the TMC government should stop politicising cyclone relief work.""We completely support what the governor has said. The TMC government should stop politicising the relief work. Yesterday Babul Supriyo faced massive protests. Our partymen who had gone to South 24 Parganas district were not allowed to distribute relief materials. Is this a healthy practice?"" Ghosh said.The fresh war of words between the governor and state government comes a day after Banerjee urged the people to reamin positive and not to indulge in politics while providing help to those affected by the natural calamity.""Nobody should do politics over distribution of relief material. Relief material should be distributed irrespective of political identities,"" Banerjee had said at the administrative review meeting on Wednesday at Basirhat in North 24 Parganas, which was pounded by the cyclone.Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with the state government over several issues, had lauded the chief minister's role in leading from the front as the state government and other central agencies worked in synergy to minimize the impact of Cyclone Bulbul.The governor, who assumed office in July end, has been locked in a war of words with the state government over a number of issues -- ranging from his seating at the Durga Puja carnival to comments on his security since he rushed to Jadavpur University on September 19 to ""rescue"" Union minister Babul Supriyo, who had been gheraoed by a section of students.A total 14 people, including fishermen of a capsized trawler whose bodies were found by the Coast Guard, had died in the cyclone, which made its landfall late on Saturday between Sagar Island in West Bengal and Khepupara in Bangladesh. As many as six lakh people have been affected and over five lakh houses damaged due to the calamity."

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Thursday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party not to scare or intimidate it, and let the Sena choose its own political path, here.""We are prepared to fight and die, but will not tolerate threats or coercive tactics"", Raut announced sternly to the media.He was referring to BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah 's comments on the power-sharing formula with the Sena behind closed doors, prior to the last Lok Sabha election.""I have heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak that Devendra Fadnavis would be the next Chief Minister in Maharashtra...Even Sena had repeatedly said that it's CM would take oath,"" Raut said.The Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has said that as per an understanding, the Sena would get 50:50 power-share including the post of Chief Minister.However, this has been dismissed outright by Shah and Fadnavis, virtually portraying Thackeray as a liar, and prompted him to snap the alliance with the BJP.""Why did you not inform Prime Minister Modi of the decisions taken behind closed door? Why did you keep silent till the election results came out before denying the understanding?"" Raut demanded.He said the Sena could have countered Modi's speeches, but they respected him and the dignity of his high post and hence kept quiet.""What they term as merely a 'room' is a divine temple for us because that was the place where the late Bal Thackeray used to meet and advise everyone on everything. So we will not lie about the understanding arrived there,"" Raut declared.He said the BJP always talks of not making public decisions reached behind closed doors, but if they had kept their word and promises, the matter would never have popped out in open, he pointed out.Raut was speaking to media -- his first after he underwent an angioplasty on Monday and he was discharged from the Lilavati Hospital on Wednesday."

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Thursday alleged that imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra was a ""scripted act"" and took a jibe at the governor , saying he has now given parties six months to form government.It also said that former state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is shedding ""crocodile tears"" over the imposition of President's rule as power is still indirectly in the hands of the BJP.Criticising the governor for giving the Shiv Sena just 24 hours to stake claim and refusing it additional time to muster numbers, an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' said, ""It looked like some invisible power was controlling this game and decisions were taken accordingly.""President's rule was imposed in the state on Tuesday after Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari sent a report to the Centre, stating that formation of a stable government was impossible in the current situation despite all his efforts.The Sena alleged that protocol was not followed when it went to the Raj Bhawan to seek more time to stake claim for government formation.The governor waited for the term of the 13th Assembly to end. Had he initiated the government formation procedure earlier, his action of recommending President's rule would have looked ""ethically correct"", the Marathi publication said.""The governor is so kind that he has now given us six months,"" it said in sarcastic remarks.""In fact, the imposition of President's rule was a scripted act. It was already decided,"" the Sena alleged.The governor was earlier an RSS worker and served as chief minister of Uttarakhand. But Maharashtra is a grand state in terms of geography and history, it noted.""When the governor denies 48 hours (to stake claim), then people would think something is wrong with the way he is acting,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led said.The Shiv Sena said after the imposition of President's rule, Fadnavis termed it as an ""unfortunate"" development.Had Fadnavis condemned the decision of President's rule, then it could have been said his intentions were true, the Sena opined.""The former chief minister has expressed concern on whether President's rule would impact investments in Maharashtra. Fadnavis is shedding crocodile tears. If someone is shedding crocodile tears over Presidents rule in the state, it is a farce,"" the editorial said.With President's rule, the power is still indirectly in the BJP's hands, it said, adding that those who demitted office ""look happy"" with this decision.The BJP and Shiv Sena, which fought the October 21 state polls in alliance, secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the 288-member Assembly.But the BJP did not cede the Sena's demand of sharing the chief minister's post, leading to falling apart of the nearly three-decade-old alliance.The Congress and NCP won 44 and 54 seats, respectively, in the last month's polls.After the imposition of President's rule in the state, the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders on Wednesday held hectic parleys to work out a 'common minimum programme' for government formation."

NEW DELHI: After the gusto with which Shiv Sena rushed its petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday to challenge Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari’s refusal to grant it three days to show majority support in the Maharashtra assembly, the party on Wednesday made no attempts to seek early hearing from the apex court on its pending plea.The lawyers acquainted with the situation, including Kapil Sibal , admitted that the petition challenging the governor’s refusal to give time to Sena to form government had been overtaken by events with imposition of President’s rule and that, if needed, Sena must challenge the governor’s recommendation and the Centre’s decision to impose central rule in the state which saw a hung Assembly after elections.But the real reason behind the loss of enthusiasm, which Sena had shown on Tuesday by filing the petition and requesting the Registry to arrange for an urgent hearing, was mainly due to inability of the party to get the letters of support from NCP and Congress. Without all three coming together, the coalition would not cross the half-way mark.The lawyers said it was easy to get an urgent hearing but Sena would have had no answers if the SC asked whether they had the numbers to persuade it into requesting the Governor to consider the claim of coalition to form a government. In the assembly, BJP has 105 MLAs, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44. Sena broke pre-poll coalition with BJP, even though both had comfortable majority in the House, over its claim on the CM’s post by rotation. Sena sources said the lawyers who were asked to draft a petition challenging the imposition of President Rule in the state has also been asked to go slow as the first priority with the party is to get letters of support from the NCP and Congress. The legal advice tendered to Sena is that without cogent numbers to show to SC that the coalition has crossed half-way mark, it would be futile to litigate on this issue."

NEW DELHI: BJP president Amit Shah on Wednesday broke his silence on the political crisis in Maharashtra and hit out at Shiv Sena, the party's estranged ally. The BJP chief made it clear thatwere not acceptable to his party.""Before elections Prime Minister and I said many times in public that if our alliance wins then Devendra Fadnavis will be the chief minister, but no one objected back then. Now they have come up with new demands which are not acceptable to us,"" the BJP chief said in an interview to news agency ANI.After the Maharashtra assembly election results, Shiv Senawith the BJP demanding 50:50 share in power and the chief minister's post on rotational basis. Shiv Sena claimed that the two parties had agreed to equal sharing of power before the elections. However, the BJP strongly rejected this claim and asserted that it had made no commitment on the issue of rotational CM.The BJP and the Shiv Sena got an absolute majority in Maharashtra assembly polls but could not form the government due to differences over power-sharing.Amit Shah also slammed the opposition parties for targeting governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari ""Before this, in no state was so much time given,18 days were given. Governor invited parties only after assembly tenure ended. Neither Shiv Sena nor the Congress-NCP staked claim and neither we. Even if today any party has numbers it can approach governor,"" the BJP chief said.""I only want to say that the ruckus over the President's Rule is a meaningless exercise to gain public sympathy and nothing else,"" he said.Shah also took a dig at the Congress over its allegations that the President's Rule was imposed in a hurry and its ally NCP was not given enough time to show the majority.""Probably they do not ask their allies,"" he said.Shah said that between 11.30am and 12pm on Tuesday, the NCP expressed its inability to form the government by writing a letter to the governor that they cannot form government till the time given of 8.30pm.""After that, there was no point for the President to wait till 8.30pm,"" he said.Shah said the governor had to take action after the term of assembly ended and he asked different parties.The home minister said the assembly has not been dissolved but kept in suspended animation.He said allegations could have been made if the assembly was dissolved.BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 105 seats followed by Shiv Sena with 56.

MUMBAI: Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena leaders condemned the “haste” shown by the Maharashtra governor in declaring President’s rule, accusing him of acting at BJP’s behest to deprive them of an opportunity to form a government together.However, both sides stopped short of declaring support for each other, choosing to buy time for discussions that would enable them to form an alliance.Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who held a press meet along with NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday, confirmed “Uddhavji” had spoken to his party chief, Sonia Gandhi , on Monday and sought her support. “It was the first time yesterday” Sena formally asked for support, Patel said. “Now, we will discuss it among ourselves, then have discussions with Sena.”Pawar added, “Unless we discuss how the government can run smoothly, it won’t be easy to form an alliance.”After the conversation with Thackeray and a call to Pawar, Sonia had sent her emissaries, Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge and K C Venugopal, to Mumbai to study the prospects for government formation.And while Congress and NCP indicated they were in no hurry to form a government — “the governor has given us ample time,” said Pawar in a sarcastic reference to the fact that B S Koshyari had set a 24-hour deadline for Sena and NCP to muster up support.Thackeray endorsed the view that the three parties had “very different ideologies” and talks to evolve a “common minimum programme” with Congress and NCP would continue.Asked how parties so ideologically different could come together, Uddhav said he had sought information on how BJP formed a government with people like Mehbooba Mufti Ram Vilas Paswan and Chandrababu Naidu."

MUMBAI: The BJP on Tuesday blamed ""stubbornness"" of its estranged ally and political rival Shiv Sena , without taking its name, for imposition of President's Rule in Maharashtra, following a 19-day-long political impasse in the state.on Tuesday evening, after governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari sent a report to the Centre stating that formation of a stable government was impossible in the current situation despite all his efforts.""Imposition of President's Rule is an insult to the mandate of the people and this had happened because of the stubbornness of some people who disrespected that mandate. We are keeping a close watch on evolving political situation,"" senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar told reporters after attending a BJP core committee meeting.In the assembly elections held last month for the 288-member House, the BJP won the maximum 105 seats, followed by its ally Sena (56). The opposition NCP and Congress won 54 and 44 seats, respectively. The poll results were announced on October 24.However, the Sena refused to back the BJP in forming a government claiming that the Amit Shah-led party had gone back on its promise of allotting rotational chief ministership to the Sena.Responding to the governor's invitation, the BJP on Sunday declined to form a government for want of enough numbers in absence of the Sena's support.""Despite getting a clear mandate, we didn't explore alternatives like our ally who after the poll results talked about having other options,"" Mungantiwar said while referring to the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's efforts to cobble up a possible government with the support of the Congress and the NCP.""If they were so confident of forming a government why did they fail to get letters of support?"" he asked.The Sena on Monday night failed to produce required letters of support from the Congress and the NCP when the saffron party leaders met the governor at Raj Bhavan as per the set deadline.The governor then invited the NCP, the third largest bloc, to stake the claim to form a government on Tuesday night. However, President's was imposed in the evening.Meanwhile, BJP Legislative Party leader Devendra Fadnavis has hoped the state will soon get a stable government even as he termed the imposition of President's Rule ""unfortunate"".""Despite a clear mandate, a government could not be formed and President's Rule had to be imposed. This is extremely unfortunate. I hope the state gets a stable government soon,"" Fadnavis said in a statement.The former chief minister said the state is facing several issues.""Providing relief and assistance to farmers who faced crop losses after unseasonal rains is a key issue. Due to political instability, investment in the state could be impacted and people would face problems. I hope all parties will seriously consider this situation, and the state will get a stable government,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday lost its oldest and the only major Hindutva ally as the Shiv Sena , its partner for more than three decades, walked out of the Modi government at the Centre.The decision of the Maharashtra party to snap ties came following years of unease in the alliance and reached a flash point after the recent assembly election results, with the Sena accusing the BJP of breaking ""promise"" of equal division of power in the state.The BJP has asserted that it had never agreed to share the post of chief minister, as claimed by Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.The divorce between the two parties wedded to the Hindutva ideology finally happened after an acrimonious relationship over the last five years. The first strains in their ties surfaced in the 2014 assembly polls when they fought separately after the Sena's refusal to part with the number of seats the BJP wanted.As Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to an unprecedented win in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, it sensed an opening in Maharashtra to oust Sena from the position of senior ally, a position the party founded by Bal Thackeray had enjoyed till his reign.The Sena was forced to become the junior partner as the BJP won 122 seats in the 288-member assembly while it won 63.They joined hands to form the government, with the BJP's Devendra Fadnavis becoming the chief minister. The first and only saffron government in the state earlier between 1995-2000 was headed by Sena leaders.The Sena, however, never reconciled to its reduced status as the lotus bloomed in one local poll after another and the BJP under Modi and its president Amit Shah also became the flag bearer of Hindutva with Thackeray's party following in its shadow.Through its mouthpiece Saamana and sundry leaders Sena kept attacking the Modi government off and on and even blocked its leader Anil Desai from joining as a minister in the Centre.That it was never given portfolios of its choice at either the Centre or the state always remained an irritant for the party.With 18 members in Lok Sabha, the Sena was the biggest NDA constituent after the BJP but its departure will not make any difference to the government's stability as the ruling party alone has 303 MPs in the 543-member House.While on the one hand Sena's severing ties with the NDA underscores the BJP's growing hegemony which forced an avowed secular party like the Congress to mull supporting a strident Hindutva party like the Sena, it also highlights how the ruling party's expansionist drive under Modi and Amit Shah has made its allies of decades uneasy.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar , who heads the JD(U), hardly shares the same level of warmth with the BJP since his return to the NDA in 2016 that he did when he was part of the saffron alliance for more than 15 years before breaking ties in 2013.Kumar's party has refused to join the Modi government as it believes that it was not offered its due share. Akali Dal- the second oldest BJP ally after the Sena- has often in the past expressed its reservations over its ally's policies.The BJP in the last few years lost a major ally like TDP but also gained a big regional partner like AIADMK and several smaller allies in northeastern states."

MUMBAI: With the Maharashtra governor inviting the Shiv Sena to stake claim, party chief Uddhav Thackeray now faces the biggest test of his political life to form a Sena-led government in the state.Thackeray, 59, a regional leader, stood up and held his ground against a national party (BJP) over tussle for sharing power, a political analyst said on condition of anonymity.Now, he will have to prove his credentials as a leader who can navigate a new political path with parties like the Congress and NCP, which are ideologically different, he said.""The tie-up will be with a national party and it remains to be seen how he will convince (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi to support him. Will he soften the fiery Hindutva stand, which the Shiv Sena espouses, or will that be an obstacle, the coming days will tell,"" the analyst said.Another challenge for Thackeray will be whether to accept the post of chief minister, though there has been a clamour from some segments to project first time MLA and his son Aaditya as the party's chief ministerial face.""There could be a crisis in the party if someone else is made (CM). There could be differences if another leader is appointed the chief minister,"" the analyst said.While Thackeray has shown political sagacity and maturity, the BJP will not sit quiet and may try to topple a Sena-led government, he claimed.""Uddhav will have to keep his flock of MLAs together,"" he said.Twenty years ago, Thackeray was seen as a reluctant politician, living a cosy life with his wife Rashmi and sons Aaditya and Tejas.The Sena leader, for whom photography is a passion, had set up an advertising agency called 'Chaurang'.Like Rajiv Gandhi , who started out in politics by helping his mother Indira Gandhi, Uddhav Thackeray began assisting his father Bal Thackeray at a time when the firebrand Sena patriarch was aging and the party's sphere was expanding, the analyst said.Amid new developments in the state's political arena after the recent Assembly polls, Thackeray's ability to lead his party with its traditional street-fighter aggression would now face an acid test, he added."

MUMBAI: Against the backdrop of Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari inviting the Shiv Sena to form government, party leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said if he shows concern towards the route, the destiny would not like it.The remark comes a day after the BJP announced it would not form government in Maharashtra and accused the Shiv Sena of ""disrespecting"" people's mandate secured by the NDA in recent assembly polls.Amid the bitter tussle with the BJP over the chief minister's post, the Shiv Sena has been making efforts to reach out to the NCP and Congress.""Raaste ki parwah karunga to manzil bura maan jaayegi...."", Raut said in a tweet in Hindi.The Rajya Sabha member has of late been taking potshots at the BJP and acting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis through his tweets.The Shiv Sena, which is the second largest party in the 288-member House after the BJP, has time till 7.30 pm on Monday to stake claim to form government in the state.In the October 21 state polls, the BJP won 105 seats while the Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats.Besides, the NCP got 54 seats and the Congress 44.Though the BJP and Shiv Sena contested the elections jointly, the Amit Shah-led party's refusal to share the chief minister's post became the bone of contention between the saffron parties, resulting in a stalemate over government formation after the poll results were declared on October 24.If the Sena decides to form government with the support of the opposition parties, the collective strength of the three parties in the House will go up to 154, above the halfway mark of 145.While the Congress is holding up its cards, the NCP made it clear on Sunday that the Shiv Sena would have to break away from the NDA before the Sharad Pawar-led party can think of lending support to Uddhav Thackeray's party.However, Raut has been unfazed and reiterating that his party would have its chief minister in the state at any cost."

MUMBAI: The 35 legislators camping in Jaipur have made it clear to AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge that in the larger interest of the party and to avoid a constitutional crisis as well as mid-term polls, it should either join or provide external support to a Shiv Sena-led government, a Congress MLA-elect told TOI.The Sena may seek a few days' time to submit documentary evidence before governor B S Koshyari to prove support of legislators required for government formation.But according to another Congress leader, Maharashtra is heading for President's rule as it may not be possible for the Sena to prove majority on the floor of the House within a couple of days. ""The Sena will have to move in a hurry to mobilise support of Congress and NCP. Sharad Pawar may oblige, but Congress will take a long time owing to procedural wrangle. We are doubtful if the Sena will get the 144 MLAs required for government formation.""State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat, former CMs Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan, and leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar are in Jaipur. ""The BJP will try to create a constitutional crisis, impose President's rule and later enforce mid-term polls. If we want to avoid this, we will have to support the Sena-led government,"" a former minister said. Both Kharge and Thorat said the mandate is for the Congress and NCP to sit in the opposition, but the sentiments expressed by the MLAs will be brought to the notice of the Congress high command.Ashok Chavan said: ""We had contested the elections with the NCP. So, any decision which will have political implications, will have to be taken after consulting Pawar."" NCP's Nawab Malik said the Sena will have to submit a common minimum programme to the NCP, only then a discussion on alliance will be possible. ""Pawar has convened a meeting of NCP MLAs on November 12 to take stock of the current political situation, particularly after Devendra Fadnavis expressed his inability to form the government,"" he added.While from Malik's statement, it appears that the NCP is keen on joining hands with the Sena, Pawar has expressed the view that in the absence of numbers, it will not be possible for his party to stake claim for government formation. ""We contested the polls with Congress. The mandate for us is to sit in the opposition and we will play that role constructively,"" he said."

Its ally Shiv Sena won 56 seats, but the two parties are bickering over the chief minister's post.The term of the 13th state assembly ended on Saturday.On Friday, after Fadnavis resigned as chief minister and was asked by the governor to continue as caretaker CM, the two allies had a bitter showdown over what was decided mutually about the top post during their negotiations before the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year.While Fadnavis claimed the BJP never promised to share the chief minister's post with its ally, Shiv Sena head Uddhav Thackeray maintained that assurance of equal sharing of all posts was given, and the BJP must not portray him as a liar.The Shiv Sena has shifted most of its 56 MLAs to a hotel in suburban Malad, apparently to guard them against 'poaching' attempts.Besides, all 44 Congress MLAs from Maharashtra are at a resort in Jaipur in the party-ruled Rajasthan amid similar fears.Both the Congress and its ally NCP on Saturday said the governor should have taken the decision to ask the BJP to indicate its willingness to form government much earlier.The NCP also said it would vote against the BJP if there is a floor test.Further, it could think of an ""alternative"" if the Shiv Sena too voted against the BJP, NCP's chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said."

NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday held the Modi government responsible for taking away livelihoods through demonetisation and said her party will ensure that the nation never forgets or forgives the ""Tughlaqi blunder"".She said the Prime Minister and his colleagues have never taken responsibility for the ""faux pas"" that claimed over 120 lives and proved a death knell for India's medium and small businesses.""No matter how much the Modi government may try and evade responsibility for this ludicrous and short-sighted measure, the nation and its people will ensure that they are held accountable,"" Gandhi said in a statement.""The Prime Minister and his colleagues have stopped speaking about demonetisation since 2017, hoping that the nation will forget. Unfortunately for them, the Congress will ensure that neither the nation nor history, forgives or forgets. Because unlike the BJP, we serve in the 'national interest',"" she added.She said three years on, demonetisation is perhaps the single most appropriate metaphor for the BJP's ""ill-conceived governance model"".""It was a preposterous measure fuelled by false propaganda, which did untold damage to innocent and trusting countrymen. This, in a nutshell, is a summary of the Modi government's approach to governance,"" she said.""Yet, despite all the empty rhetoric about holding himself accountable, the Prime Minister and his colleagues never once took responsibility for - or even acknowledged - this faux pas that claimed over a hundred and twenty lives (by a conservative estimate), proved a death knell for India's medium and small businesses, snatched the livelihoods of India's farmers and reduced millions of families to the very margins of poverty,"" she noted.Gandhi recalled that on November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes by one sweeping measure and promised the nation to wipe out black money, eliminate fake currency and purge terrorism and naxalism.The BJP government even told the Supreme Court that black money to the tune of Rs 3,00,000 crore will be purged as it would not return into the system.Subsequently, the Prime Minister added the objective of abolition of cash currency usage and to replace it with a digital economy, she said.""Three years later, Prime Minister Modi has failed spectacularly on all these counts,"" said Sonia Gandhi.The Congress chief said the RBI has confirmed that 99.3 per cent of all the devalued Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes have been re-deposited with zero windfall gain. ""Fake notes turned out to be a miniscule and negligible percentage of the notes in circulation (again, as per the RBI).""Terror and naxalite activities have actually seen an increase after demonetisation as per the government's own published data and the currency in circulation has actually seen a 22 per cent increase over pre-demonetisation level, she noted.""The simple question being asked by every Indian is - What did the Demonetisation achieve? What it did instead, was to wipe out over one crore jobs from the economy (and still counting), take the unemployment rate to a 45 year high, shaved two full percentage points off GDP growth and ensured that India's international rating moved from 'stable' to 'negative'. It is now widely acknowledged as a herculean blunder by independent economists and taught, across the world, as a cautionary tale of 'what governments should not do',"" she said."

MUMBAI: The BJP should approach the Shiv Sena only if it agrees to share the chief minister's post with the junior saffron ally in Maharashtra, senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Friday.Talking to reporters here, he said the BJP should not misuse the provision of ""caretaker"" government and remain in power in Maharashtra, where there is an impasse over the next dispensation.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis should resign as the term of the existing assembly is ending (on November 9), the Sena spokesman said.To a question on Union minister and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari 's trip to Mumbai and possibility of him visiting 'Matoshree' (the residence of Thackerays) to break the logam over government formation, Raut said the BJP should approach the Sena only if it is willing to share the CM post.""Gadkari is a resident of Mumbai. There is no news that he is coming. He will go to his house. Has he told you that he is bringing a letter giving the Sena 2.5 years of chief ministership?"" he asked.The BJP and the Shiv Sena, which together have enough seats to form the next government, are engaged in a bitter tussle over power-sharing, particularly over the CM's post."

MUMBAI: The BJP is still hoping that the Shiv Sena will join the government but “may even approach the NCP” for support in case its pre-poll ally chooses not to cooperate, a senior BJP cabinet member said on condition of anonymity. The BJP may not stake claim to form the government on Friday if it is not confident of winning the floor test, the cabinet member said.“The BJP leadership has made it clear that if there is no clear majority, we should not attempt to form the government. We know we do not have the numbers. We are still hoping the Sena will come to our rescue. We may even approach the NCP as it had helped us in 2014. If we fail in our experiments, it will not be advisable to stake claim. We do not want an embarrassing situation if the confidence motion is defeated on the floor of the House,” the cabinet member said.The cabinet member said after the October 24 poll results, numerous efforts were to persuade the Sena to join, but there has been no response from their ally. “We feel that the Sena’s demand is unrealistic as, out of 288 seats, it has secured 56 seats against 105 won by BJP,” he said.The cabinet member said the BJP is sure the governor will explore all possibilities for government formation before Saturday.“As per convention, he will have to first invite the single largest party, followed by the second, third and fourth largest parties. After all options are exhausted, he can recommend President’s rule,” he said."

NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing talks between the Congress and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) for the assembly election are in final stages and an announcement is likely on Friday, sources said.The Congress, JMM and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are attempting to form an alliance to defeat the ruling BJP in the five-phase election in November-December in the eastern state.According to sources, deliberations are on between senior leaders of the Congress and the JMM for finalising the seat-sharing agreement and an announcement is likely to be made in Ranchi on Friday.Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee president Rameshwar Oraon and Congress Legislature Party leader Alamgir Alam met JMM chief Hemant Soren Sources said the JMM is likely to be the leading partner in the alliance and will contest on more than 50 per cent of the seats.The Congress may settle with 25-30 seats in the 81-member assembly, leaving the rest for smaller allies.The Congress had contested on all seats in the last assembly elections in 2014, it may settle for 25-30 seats as part of the alliance.The Congress has already held preliminary discussions on its possible candidates for the election at a meeting of the party's screening committee.Another meeting of the screening panel will be held on November 9. On the same day, a meeting of the central election committee chaired by Sonia Gandhi will be held to finalise the list of candidates.Sources said the Congress is unlikely to succeed in its efforts to form a grand alliance with the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) of Babulal Marandi deciding to go it alone in the election.The Left parties are also unlikely to be a part of the alliance as their demand for seats are unlikely to be met, sources said.The Left has two members in the current assembly, while the Congress has six.Sources add that the RJD is likely to settle for around 6-7 seats as part of the alliance, even though Lalu Prasad Yadav's outfit has been demanding 14-15 seats.""Our aim is to remove the Raghubar Das-led BJP government ... The Congress and its partners will try to fulfil the dreams of people of the state that have not been fulfilled so far,"" RPN Singh, the Congress party in-charge of Jharkhand affairs, told PTI.Asked if the Congress was willing to play second fiddle to JMM in the state, he said that when there is a coalition, all allies contest as a family to accomplish the dreams of the people of Jharkhand.Singh said the Congress would soon come out with a manifesto of its own, besides having a common minimum programme with the JMM."

MUMBAI: With the term of the previous Maharashtra assembly set to end on Saturday, the yet-unreconciled allies BJP and Shiv Sena have announced independent moves for Thursday.While Sena president Uddhav Thackeray has summoned his party’s newly-elected 56 MLAs for talks at his residence in Bandra , senior BJP ministers Chandrakant Patil and Sudhir Mungantiwar will meet Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and stake the party’s claim to form the government.BJP’s plan to go ahead with the swearing in of Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and his council of ministers, minus the Sena, will expedite political developments in the state in the next few days, observers said.Much depends on whether Fadnavis reaches the 145-mark during the Speaker’s election and whether the Sena comes forward with its claim, backed by the NCP-Congress, in case Fadnavis is defeated on the floor of the assembly, they pointed out.Talking to mediapersons, Mungantiwar described the impending swearing in of Fadnavis as “sweet news” and added that “in view of the many problems farmers are facing, it is imperative that the new government be installed without further delay.”Sena MP Sanjay Raut , who has been fiercely toeing an anti-BJP line at Thackeray’s behest, however said the “sweet news” will be that Maharashtra will have a Sena CM, suggesting his party was unwilling to budge from its stand that BJP and Sena should equally share ministerial portfolios and the chief minister’s post. The swearing in of Fadnavis and BJP ministers may be scheduled for Saturday.The BJP high command, which is unwilling to placate Matoshree, is keeping its powder dry for President’s rule in Maharashtra should Fadnavis fail to muster the magic 145 figure during the floor test in the 288-strong assembly, sources said.A bizarre situation has thus unfolded in state politics with both BJP and Sena playing moves and counter-moves to outmaneouvre each other to wrest power, while also planning conciliatory measures in a last-ditch attempt to keep the saffron ship afloat amid troubled waters.BJP thinks Matoshree may be ready for a thaw in view of the gnawing unease among a section of the Sena’s newly-elected MLAs who are keen on joining the BJP regime in view of the escalating agrarian distress following unseasonal rain.In Video: Maharashtra alliance intact, BJP-Sena to form government"

BENGALURU: A day after stating that he wants the B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka to complete its term, JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda on Wednesday said there were no permanent friends or enemies in politics.In what is being perceived as JD(S) softening of stand on the BJP, Gowda, not wanting mid-term polls, on Tuesday had said he wants the government to complete its term as it would give him time to build his party.Is Yediyurappa an enemy? Siddaramaiah and I have fought in the past, but we also shared a stage in Shivamogga and Ballari recently. No one can say what will come at what time, Gowda said.Speaking to reporters here, he said, In politics there are no permanent enemies or friends. According to situation it keeps changing.Gowda's son and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy too had recently said his party would not try to dislodge the ruling BJP government like the Amit Shah-led party had done to his coalition government and had opined that he did not think that mid-term polls would be held.Gowda and Kumaraswamy's statements have come in at a time for the BJP, when it will need to win at least six of 15 seats that will go to the bypolls on December 5, to remain in power.There is also speculation that the JD(S) may extend support to the BJP if it fails to win maximum number of seats in the bypolls.Meanwhile, amid some reports that Gowda had rung him up recently assuring support, Yediyurappa on Wednesday clarified that he has not had any phone conversation with the former prime minister.As reports surfaced in a section of the media about the conversation, Gowda had issued a statement rejecting it and termed it as ""far from truth"".However, Gowda on Wednesday said, he had spoken to the Chief Minister, but politics was not involved.Noting that no conversation has happened between him and Yediyurappa regarding politics, other than once on some book house issue, Gowda in response to a question said ""He (Yediyurappa) is the Chief Minister right? Whom should I talk to other than him?Gowda also welcomed the chief minister's action against a police officer in Yadgir, which he had sought.""Chief Minister after coming to know has acted. Im happy..He has taken immediate action. I welcome the action, he said, as he asked party workers not to celebrate it as ""achievement"" or victory.Gowda had threatened a protest in front of Yediyurappa's residence against the ""high-handedness"" of the BJP government, referring to a recent incident of police action against JD(S) workers who were protesting against the chief minister during his visit to Yadgir.Reacting to this, Yediyurappa earlier said Already the police officer there has been transferred and has been asked to go on leave. I will convince Deve Gowda.As a former Prime Minister whatever he says, I will take action accordingly.""Meanwhile, reacting to the development, State Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao claimed ideologically JD(S) has no strong secular stand.""What JD(S) will do at what time, with whom they will become friends or enemy, we cannot say, it is left for them. Ideologically they don't have strong secular stand or any principle.They have said several times that they will go along with those who help them, he said."

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray hasn't received any proposal from the BJP over government formation in Maharashtra, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Wednesday.Raut told reporters that if the BJP leaders are meeting Governor Koshyari on Thursday, his party was okay with the move.""We met the Governor. Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athawale also met him. And if BJP leaders are meeting the Governor (to stake claim to form the government), then they should form the government as they are the single largest party,"" he said.""We have been saying that the BJP being the single largest party, should form the government,"" he said.Uddhav Thackeray hasn't received any proposal from BJP, he said.A delegation of the BJP, to be led by state unit president Chandrakant Patil, will meet Koshyari ""with a message approved by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis ,"" senior leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said. He was speaking to reporters outside Varsha, the official residence of the chief minister.""The details of the meeting with the governor will be shared with media later,"" Mungantiwar said. He also informed that the party has decided to initiate procedure to select a new state unit president.He said incumbent Chandrakant Patil will remain in the next Cabinet. ""The procedure to select new state BJP chief will be completed by December 31,"" Mungantiwar said.The BJP has adopted the policy of one person one rank. Patil, believed to be a close confidante of party chief Amit Shah , took charge as the state BJP president in July this year.The BJP and the Sena are locked in a stand-off over the post of chief minister in new government and sharing of ministerial portfolios.In the recent assembly polls, the BJP won the maximum 105 seats in the 288-member House. The Sena won 56 seats."

MUMBAI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday asked the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena to form government in Maharashtra at the earliest, and asserted that his party and its ally Congress will work as a ""responsible opposition"".Addressing a press conference here after meeting senior Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut , Pawar ruled out joining the Uddhav Thackeray-led party in government with the outside support of the Congress, an idea making rounds in political circles for the last few days.""Where is the question (of a non-BJP government)?"" he asked, saying the BJP and the Shiv Sena have been in alliance for 25 years, and they ""will come together sooner or later"".""If we had the numbers, we wouldn't have waited for anyone (for government formation). The Congress and NCP didn't cross the 100 mark...we will work as a responsible opposition,"" said the 78-year-old political stalwart.Noting that the BJP and Shiv Sena have got the mandate to rule, he said, ""They should form the government at the earliest and not allow the state to slip in a constitutional crisis. They should allow us to fulfil the mandate assigned to us by people (to sit in opposition).""On his discussion with Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Monday over the issue of supporting the Shiv Sena, he said, ""The Congress and NCP fought the election in alliance.""We want all decisions about the political situation to be taken by consensus. I am not aware what is the decision of the Congress.""The Maratha strongman also dismissed speculation that he may return as the state's chief minister.""I have been the chief minister four times and have no interest again,"" he said.Asked about senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel's meeting with Union Transport Minister and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi on Wednesday, Pawar declined to attach any political significance to it, saying, ""It must be about some road work.""Pawar, a Rajya Sabha member, also said Raut met him in Mumbai on Wednesday to discuss issues to be jointly raised in the Upper House during Parliament session beginning on November 18.On Raut claiming the Shiv Sena will install its chief minister with the support of 170 MLAs, Pawar wondered from where the party will manage to get this number.""I have read about him talking about (backing of) 170 (MLAs to the Shiv Sena for government formation). We are also searching from where they will be cobbled up,"" the former Union minister said.A journalist asked Pawar whether the results of the October 21 Maharashtra Assembly poll have changed the perception that BJP chief Amit Shah ensures formation of government in a state whether or not the party has majority.Responding, the NCP chief said, ""If he is an expert, then like you (the media), we are also waiting to see the skills of the expert.""Meanwhile, responding to Pawar's statement asking the BJP and Shiv Sena to form government at the earliest, Raut said, ""He is right. The party with 105 MLAs should form the government.""The NCP on Tuesday said a political alternative can be worked out in the state only if the Shiv Sena declared that it had snapped ties with the BJP.Sources in the NCP said their party wants Arvind Sawant , the lone Shiv Sena minister in the Union government, to resign before going ahead further with the Uddhav Thackeray -led party.There has been no headway in government formation after results of the state polls were declared on October 24.The term of the existing state Assembly expires on November 9.The BJP, which won 105 seats, and the Shiv Sena, which bagged 56, are locked in a bitter tussle over sharing of the chief minister's post and ministerial portfolios in new government, even two weeks after the Assembly poll verdict handed them a clear majority to form a coalition dispensation.They won 161 seats together in the 288-member House, much above the halfway mark of 145.Besides, the opposition NCP won 54 seats, while the Congress got 44.The Sena had called off a meeting to hold formal talks with the BJP on October 29 after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected Thackeray's claims that a formula had been ""agreed upon"" on ""equal sharing of power"" between the parties ahead of the April-May 2019 Lok Sabha polls.High-profile meetings in New Delhi on Monday between Pawar and Sonia Gandhi, and the one between Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and BJP chief Amit Shah failed to give any indication of breaking the logjam over government formation.Raut has time and again said the state's next chief minister will be from his party. However, the BJP has insisted that Fadnavis will continue in the post.In Video: BJP, Shiv Sena are together for 25 years, will join hands again eventually: Sharad Pawar"

KOLKATA: West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Wednesday said he is ""not at war"" with the state government and that his obective is to serve the people.Dhankhar, who has been at loggerheads with the West Bengal government over several issues, also said universities in the state are not allowed to function the way they should.""Let me say, I am not at war with the state government. I have come here to serve the people of the state,"" the governor said at an MCCI education forum here.Dhankar said that as a chancellor of universities, he has been witness to several developments that could grab headlines.""If I start to narrate all of them, it will scream the newspaper headlines the next day... As chancellor, what we see is that we don't allow universities to function as they are supposed to.""The all-pervading question which arises is who is the greater boss, the chancellor or the state?"" he said.Dhankar said he has tried to ascertain the role of both the chancellor and the state government in the functioning of universities.""What I found is that both have little roles. So in such a case, we must cooperate and not compete as to who is the bigger boss,"" he said.Dhankar also said that the 50th Conference of Governors will be held soon.""I have written to the state government that if it wishes to flag any issue, I will be glad to raise it at the conference,"" he said.The 49th Governors' Conference was held in New Delhi in 2018.Dhankhar has been locked in a war of words with the state government over a number of issues -- ranging from his seating at the Durga Puja carnival to comments on his security -- since he rushed to Jadavpur University on September 19 to 'rescue' Union minister Babul Supriyo , who had been gheraoed by a section of its students."

NEW DELHI: Amidst the uncertainity over government formation in Maharashtra, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said that his party will sit in the opposition and both the Shiv Sena and BJP should end their fued as they have the mandate of the people.""I don't have anything to say yet. BJP and Shiv Sena have got the mandate of people, so they should form the government as soon as possible. Our mandate is to play the role of the opposition,"" Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Pawar dismissed the reports of Shiv Sena-NCP alliance, saying that Sena has been with BJP for 25 years. ""They (BJP-Shiv Sena) are together for last 25 years,today or tomorrow they will come together again,"" he said.""There is only one option, which is that the BJP and Shiv Sena should form the government. There is no other option other than this to avoid President's rule,"" he added. ""I have been the chief minister four times and I'm not keen on that post again.""Pawar's remark came shortly after Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut held a meeting with the NCP chief.Though Raut termed the meeting ""a courtesy call"", it gave rise to speculations that Sena might be looking to seek the support of NCP to form a government in the state.""It was a courtesy meeting. He (Sharad Pawar) is a senior leader of the state and the country. He is worried about the political situation in Maharashtra today. We had a brief discussion,"" the Shiv Sena leader said.Shiv Sena is not ready to settle for anything less than an equal share of power as Sanjay Raut on Wednesday outrightly denied the possibility of reaching any new settlement with BJP except the one (50:50) that was allegedly agreed upon prior to polls.BJP and Shiv Sena are engaged in a bitter tug-of-war with the latter refusing to soften stand on its demands for equal sharing of Cabinet portfolios and the chief minster's tenure of 2.5 years.The state assembly elections, which ended last month, resulted in a split verdict with all the contesting parties failing to reach the majority mark.BJP emerged as the single-largest party with 105 seats, while Shiv Sena with 56 seats was the second-biggest party. NCP, 54 seats, and the Congress , 44 seats, occupied the third and fourth spots in the 288-seat assembly.In Video: People gave us mandate to sit in opposition: NCP chief Sharad Pawar"

BENGALURU: The father-son duo of the JD(S) first family, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy , appear at odds with each other over the issue of extending support to the BJP.In recent comments, Kumaraswamy had indicated willingness to support the BJP should the BS Yediyurappa-led government fall short of winning the required number of seats in the bypolls to give it a majority in a full-strength house. But Gowda on Tuesday ruled out any alliance with the BJP.“We formed an alliance with both BJP and Congress under different circumstances in the past and burnt our fingers,” Gowda told reporters on Tuesday. “We will not commit the same mistake again. We would rather sit in the opposition. There is no question of joining hands with either of them.”He said the JD(S) was planning to field candidates in all 15 assembly seats going to polls and his party would go it alone in local body polls too. “Some media reports suggest we have a soft corner for the BJP, but we neither have a soft corner for BJP nor Congress,” he said.In response to Congress leader Siddaramaiah ’s prophesy that the Yediyurappa-led BJP government will be reduced to a minority after the December 5 byelections, Kumaraswamy, the JD(S) Legislature Party leader, said he would “never allow the BJP government to fall”.Then, in an oblique reference to Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy appeared to stick to his guns when he said in a tweet, “Some leaders, in their selfish and greedy pursuit to become chief minister, are ready to topple the present government. They are unmindful of wasting people’s money. They should remember that most of the defectors [who are responsible for the fall of JD(S)-Congress government] were from their party.”That was in response to leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah’s tweet, which said: “Kumaraswamy has said he will not allow the BJP government to collapse. What else can we expect from the JD(S)? He is saying this out of fear that more JD(S) MLAs may join BJP. This is an expected political development.”"

NEW DELHI: After steering the Lok Janshakti Party for 19 years, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Tuesday announced that his son Chirag Paswan has been unanimously chosen as the new party president. The entire episode of passing the baton was smooth as Chirag’s name was proposed by his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and received unanimous support from party leaders including newly elected MP, Prince Raj from Samastipur.Prince is son of late Ramchandra Paswan.Soon after taking charge, two-time MP from Jamui, Chirag said his focus will be to expand the party base and he told mediapersons that he has already written to the BJP leaders identifying six seats it would like to contest as an ally in the upcoming Jharkhand assembly election. The LJP had contested in only one seat in the last election.The decision to name Chirag as president comes ahead of 2020 assembly elections in Bihar. He was credited for his role in the LJP joining NDA in 2014. “Workers have been pressing for young leadership. All MPs have backed the demand. I am confident, he will steer the party in the right direction for delivering justice to poor and downtrodden,” Paswan said.Chirag said though he has been chosen as party chief, but his father would always remain his “national president” and guiding force and he will be in active politics. Paswan, who is a senior minister in Narendra Modi cabinet, said he was relieved from a bigger responsibility and a young leader can tour more to energise the young cadre.Responding how the transfer of leadership was so smooth, Paswan told TOI, “In our family eldest brother is respected like father and it’s his responsibility to take care of all the members in the family. If you take care of everyone, why would there be any problem? I am sure Chirag will follow the value. He appointed Prince as the the Bihar LJP president and took the decision to field Ramchandra’s son from Samastipur. There has never been any difference within our family,” Paswan said.Paswan had founded the LJP in 2000 after splitting from JD(U)."

MANGALURU: Jaiveer Shergill spokesperson of Congress said, the party will launch a ‘ Wake up Kumbhakarna ’ campaign and protests across the nation to 'wake up' the BJP government, which is 'sleeping'.Shergill told media persons here on Tuesday that the party leaders will hold campaigns across the nation creating awareness on failures of the Narendra Modi government, especially in reviving the economy.“BJP Government is solely responsible for the deep financial distress in the Indian economy bordering on financial emergency. GDP growth is slowest in last six years. India has dropped to the level of 7th largest economy from being the 5th largest in the world. New private investments have hit a 16 year low. Household Savings are at a 20 year low. India’s overall savings rate has declined to 30% from 34.6% earlier. Industrial Growth shrank to 1.1% in August, 2019, a 7 year low. Manufacturing Growth Rate at -1.2% (negative) is lowest since October, 2014. Core Sector growth is lowest in last four years. Exports are in a free fall. Banks’ NPAs are already Rs 8,00,000 crore. Five years of BJP Government have seen nearly 25,000 cases of bank frauds involving Rs 1,74,255 crore. Instead of punishing the guilty, shielding the bank fraudsters has become the new normal of the BJP Government,” Shergill charged.According to National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), unemployment is at a 45 year high and still climbing in India. According to Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE), unemployment rate stands at 8.19% as in August, 2019 which has further reason to 8.5% i.e. highest ever. Even globally, as per International Labour Organisation (ILO), the unemployment rate is 4.95%. It means that India’s unemployment rate is the double of world’s average, he said adding that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should resign and do internship with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Further, he demanded the BJP government to present a white paper on the economic crisis India facing and the Finance Minister should explain why all measures of the government failed. “A national Financial Emergency should be declared,” he urged."

NAGPUR: Amid the impasse over government formation in Maharashtra, farm activist Kishore Tiwari, who joined the Shiv Sena ahead of the Assembly polls, has said RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat should depute Union minister Nitin Gadkari to resolve the power-tussle between the BJP and the Sena.In a letter to Bhagwat, Tiwari said the RSS chief should take a serious note of the situation and intervene to end the deadlock over government formation in Maharashtra.He said people were worried over the Sangh's ""silence"" on the issue.""Gadkari will be able to resolve the situation within two hours,"" Tiwari said, when asked about his letter to Bhagwat.Claiming that Gadkari is being ""sidelined"" by the BJP, Tiwari said if the party or Amit Shah authorise Gadkari to intervene, he can resolve the impasse in two hours.Tiwari, founder of Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, an NGO which highlighted large-scale suicides by farmers in Maharashtra, specially those from his Vidarbha region, switched over from the BJP to the Shiv Sena ahead of the October 24 polls.The BJP and Shiv Sena are engaged in a standoff over sharing the chief minister's post, with the Uddhav Thackeray- led party demanding an equal division of the top post's tenure and the BJP rejecting the same.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has asserted that the next chief minister of the state will be from his party.Multiple high-profile meetings in New Delhi and Mumbai on Monday, including one between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, failed to give any indication of breaking the 11-day-long deadlock over government formation in the state."

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would consider the fresh audio clip in which Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa is purportedly referring to 17 rebel Congress-JD(S) MLAs, who had been disqualified.A three-judge bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said since the issue has been brought to its notice the apex court would consider it. However, the bench did not specify whether it would take on record the audio clip.The top court said the issue raised now was also brought before it during the hearing on the pleas filed by these MLAs challenging the then speaker's decision to disqualify them.A purported audio clip of Yediyurappa expressing anguish against his party leaders at a recent party meeting in Hubballi over their opposition to giving tickets to the disqualified Congress-JD(S) MLAs for the December 5 assembly bypolls in 15 constituencies had surfaced last Friday.In the audio, he is purportedly saying that the rebel Congress JD(S) MLAs, who were later disqualified, were kept in Mumbai during the final days of the coalition government under BJP national president Amit Shah 's watch.Bypolls to 15 out of 17 seats represented by disqualified MLAs will be held on December 5.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for Karnataka Congress, told the bench that in the audio clip, Yediyurappa has said during the core committee meeting of the BJP that the whole thing was ""engineered"" by BJP national president, who is also the union Home Minister.He said since the top court has reserved its verdict on the batch of petitions filed by 17 disqualified MLAs challenging the then speaker's decision to disqualify them, they want to place the audio clip on record.""You have extensively covered everything in the arguments,"" the bench, also comprising justices Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari, told Sibal.Sibal, however, told the bench that the audio clip has come into light after arguments were over in the apex court.""Order of the speaker has to be tested. If you want to place additional evidence on record then we will have to issue notice,"" the bench said, adding, ""You have brought it to our notice, we will consider it. Allow us to deliver the judgement"".The bench also told Sibal that during his arguments, he had already referred to the hospitality being provided to these MLAs at Mumbai, allegedly by the BJP.The Karnataka Congress has requested the top court to take on record the audio clip in which Yediyurappa is purportedly hitting out at his party leaders for not recognising the ""sacrifice"" of the disqualified Congress-JD(S) MLAs, because of whom the BJP could come to power in the state.The speaker had disqualified 17 lawmakers as MLAs, ruling that they cease to be MLAs with immediate effect till the expiry of the 15th assembly (in 2023).The top court had on October 25 reserved verdict on the batch of petitions challenging the disqualification of the 17 Karnataka MLAs before the trust vote moved by the previous HD Kumaraswamy government."

He said, “The Sena won 56 seats only because of the alliance with the BJP, else it would not have won 25 seats in the state on its own. Twenty-five Sena MLAs are in touch with CM Fadnavis and with me, and they will join the government led by Fadnavis if the Sena decides to sit in the opposition.”Blaming the Sena for delay in formation of government, Rana said, “The Sena is creating a hindrance in forming the government even though voters have given a clear mandate. This is an insult to the people of Maharashtra. About 20-25 Sena MLAs will sit on the BJP’s side within two months once Fadnavis takes over as CM.”Rana also advised Sena president Uddhav Thackeray to rein in Sanjay Raut. “Raut is the Sena’s parrot. Uddhav Thackeray himself should speak out as he was part of the meeting with BJP national president Amit Shah and CM Fadnavis and not Raut,” he said. The Sena has said that the BJP had agreed to share the CM’s post at this meet. Rana, along with his wife Navneet Kaur, who is MP from Amravati, met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in the city on Monday to demand assistance for farmers who have lost their crops due to unseasonal rain."

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: As NCP chief Sharad Pawar discussed the impasse over government formation in Maharashtra on Monday, a leader of Pawar's party told TOI on condition of anonymity that NCP was willing to join a Shiv Sena-led government, with Congress supporting from outside and its nominee getting the speaker's post. All this would depend on the Sena terminating its alliance with the BJP, the leader added.""We have proposed the kind of formula that the Sena-BJP combine had in 1995. The Sena nominee was then CM, while the BJP nominee was deputy chief minister. We have said the Sena nominee would be the CM, and the deputy CM would be from NCP,"" the leader said.BJP has won 105 assembly seats, Sena 56 and NCP and Congress 54 and 44 respectively. After the much-awaited meeting between the NCP chief and Sonia, which stoked the pot further amid the high-voltage battle of nerves between the saffron allies, Pawar told reporters it was for BJP to form the state government with its ally Sena since they had the numbers. Significantly, he said the mandate to NCP was to sit in the opposition, but ""you cannot speak about the future"".More importantly, he lent credence to Sena's brinkmanship when asked if a ""bargaining game"" was on between the allies. ""I think the game between the two is serious,"" Pawar said.The NCP stalwart said he had received no proposal from Sena president Uddhav Thackeray but during his chat with reporters, added he could not speak about what would happen in future.Pawar is learnt to have urged the Congress chief to review her position on staying away from the Sena and to give a green signal to her state unit. He is also learnt to have told Sonia Gandhi that the Sena was serious in its clash with the BJP.However, Congress leaders have all along indicated that the Sena would have to come out of its clinch with the BJP for the party to move and think of an alliance with it.A former Maharashtra CM said that when state Congress leaders had called on Sonia Gandhi last week, they had told her that the Congress must initiate steps to prevent the BJP from coming to power in the state. ""During that meeting, there was consensus on preventing the BJP from coming to power,"" the ex-CM said.Asked if the Congress would join a Sena-led government, the former CM said the top priority of the Congress-NCP front was to keep the BJP out. ""We are yet to decide if we will join the government or give outside support, but we are determined to stop the BJP,"" he said.Among those who had met Sonia Gandhi last week were state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat, his predecessor Manikrao Thakre and former CMs Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan However, another NCP leader said he was doubtful about the Sena taking the lead in forming the government. In the past too, the Sena had taken a firm stand against the BJP but had, at the last moment, ""surrendered to the BJP leadership."" ""We have had experience with the Sena, its credibility is doubtful,"" he said.""The Congress and NCP will join the Sena's efforts provided Uddhav Thackeray personally invites the two parties to join the government,"" the first NCP leader said.Pawar, when asked by mediapersons in Delhi if he could come back as Maharashtra CM, said, ""No"".""The BJP is responsible for forming the government in Maharashtra as they along with their ally have the numbers. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray or anyone else in the Sena has not sought the NCP's support,"" he said. ""The BJP and their allies have the numbers. And responsibility is on them to form the government. We are seeing what they are doing,"" Pawar said.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that if BJP fails to stake claim, steps would have to be taken to form an alternative government. ""It will be too early to comment on who will lead such a government. We expect there would be more clarity after Sharad Pawar meets his senior colleagues on Tuesday. As of now, there is no proposal from the Sena.""In Video: NCP, Shiv Sena may join hands to form next govt in Maharashtra"

RANCHI: A day after Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) announced to contest the ensuing assembly elections on its own, the Congress on Monday said it would try to convince JVM-P president Babulal Marandi to continue with the "" Mahagathbandhan "".The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), however, said Marandi's decision would not have any impact on the opposition grouping poll prospects.""Khuchh nahin (nothing),"" JMMs general secretary-cum- spokesman Suprio Bhattacharya said, when asked what impact it would have on ""grand alliance"" after Marandi walking away from it.Marandi, a former chief minister and president of JVM-P, had on Sunday claimed the opposition parties did not show any interest when he tried to talk to them soon after the Lok Sabha elections, leaving the party to decide to contest all the 81 seats.As per the 'mahagathbandhan' understanding, the allies publicly announced before the Lok Sabha elections that the Congress would lead the Lok Sabha elections in the state while the JMM would steer the assembly polls.The Congress, however, said it would make efforts to continue the pre-Lok Sabha 'mahagathbandhan' along with JVM-P, JMM and RJD.The JMM and the Congress had won one seat each in the Parliamentary poll out of a total 14 constituencies in Jharkhand.""Our PCC president Rameshwar Oraon will soon meet Marandi ji and convince him that the people want the opposition to contest in unison,"" Jharkhand PCC spokesman Alok Dubey said.""In addition to continuing the mahagathbandhan, the Congress also wants all the left parties in the opposition alliance,"" he added.He said the pradesh election committee is meeting later in the day to delve upon party candidates, seat adjustments with opposition allies before sending the list to the steering committee of the party in Delhi.Jharkhand will see five-phase polling to the 81 seats between November 30 and December 20 with counting slated on December 23.The notification for the first of the elections will be issued on November 6.The JMM had won 19 seats in the 2014 assembly elections with two of its MLAs, Kunal Sarangi and Jai Prakash Bhai Patel, defecting to the BJP recently.The Congress, which had allied the RJD in 2014 assembly elections, has eight seats in the current House.Two of the MLAs, Sukhdeo Bhagat and Manoj Yadav, recently joined the BJP-fold.JVM (P) had won 8 seats in the previous state poll, but later six of its MLAs had defected to the BJP, leaving it with a tally of two.The RJD of Lalu Prasad has no member in Jharkhand house at present."

MUMBAI: At a time when the BJP and the Shiv Sena are unable to arrive at a consensus on sharing of power in Maharashtra, a Congress leader on Saturday wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi requesting her the Sena be given support to form the next government if it comes up with such proposal.The Sena lost no time in welcoming the stand of the Congress leader Hussain Dalwai, a Rajya Sabha MP from Maharashtra, who has written the letter.Dalwai recalled the Sena had supported Congress nominees Pratibha Patil and later Pranab Mukherjee for the post of President of India in the past.""Shiv Sena and BJP are different. The Sena had supported Pratibha Patil, Pranab Mukherjee for the President's post. Shiv Sena politics has become all-inclusive unlike that of the BJP which is extreme. We must support the Sena to keep the BJP out of power,"" Dalwai told reporters while quoting his letter.He said a cross-section of the Muslim community in the state would prefer the Sena over the BJP.The Congress seems to be divided over supporting the Sena which is one of the founding members of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).Leaders like AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge Sanjay Nirupam are against extending support to the Sena.When asked about Dalwai's letter, senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut has said, ""Dalwai belongs to the socialist ideology. He comes from a family of progressive Muslims. We welcome his stand. But, Sena fought the elections in an alliance and we will adhere to the coalition dharma till the end.""The recent elections in Maharashtra denied the BJP absolute majority desired by the party.The BJP failed to perform up to the mark though it emerged as the single largest party by winning 105 seats, 17 less than the 2014 tally, in the 288-member House. The ally Sena won 56 seats, 7 less than its 2014 performance.The halfway mark is 145.The Sena and the BJP have since been locked in a battle of nerves over sharing of power.Both the parties, who were partners in the outgoing government, have not yet started formal discussions even though the tenure of the current Legislative Assembly ends on November 8.The bone of contention is the Sena's demand for the CM's post for a equal period of 2.5 years and 50:50 division of portfolios.Both these demands have been rejected by the BJP which has insisted that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will continue to be the CM for the next five years.Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had reportedly said that other options are available for his party.Top Congress leaders from Maharashtra on Friday held meetings in Delhi and discussed the political situation with Sonia Gandhi."

MUMBAI: Amid speculations regarding probable political permutations and combinations vis-a-vis formation of the next government in Maharashtra , the Shiv Sena on Saturday said it would adhere to the ""coalition dharma"", a remark being viewed as softening of its stand towards the BJP.The Sena and the BJP are locked in a battle of nerves over sharing of power.Both the parties, who were partners in the outgoing government, have not even started formal discussions even though the tenure of the current Legislative Assembly ends on November 8.""The Sena contested the assembly elections in an alliance and we would adhere to the coalition dharma till the last moment,"" Sena leader Sanjay Raut told reporters.He also welcomed Congress leader Hussain Dalwai's move to write a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi recommending support for the Uddhav Thackeray-led party in forming the new government.Interestingly, Raut said on Friday the Senato form a stable government.""Considering the prevailing political situation in the state, every one is talking to each other except the Sena and the BJP. The Sena did not stop talks of government formation.. the talks never began,"" he said.Raut also appeared to play down his recent meeting with NCP president Sharad Pawar amid speculation that a new political equation might emerge in the state to keep BJP away from power.""There are several issues concerning Maharashtra on which leaders of different political parties talk to each other,"" he said.""Were PDP and BJP in Kashmir and TDP and BJP in Andhra Pradesh of similar ideology?"" he questioned.When asked about a speculation that Devendra Fadnavis will take oath as Chief Minister for a second term early next week, Raut pointed out that the governor invites the single largest party to form the government as per convention.""What is important for government formation is the support of 145 MLAs (in the 288-member House). Whosoever has this number, we wish them well,"" he said.When asked about NCP chief Sharad Pawar's statement that his party and Congress would sit in the Opposition, Raut said, ""What is wrong in that statement""?On Dalwai's letter to Gandhi suggesting that the Congress can support the Sena in formation of government, Raut said, ""Dalwai belongs to the socialist ideology.

MUMBAI: The people have asked the NCP to sit in the opposition and the party will do that, its chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday.Pawar's comments come amid talk about the possibility of NDA constituent Shiv Sena forming government in Maharashtra with support from the NCP and the Congress.Speaking to reporters in Nashik, he also termed as ""childish"" the tussle between the BJP and its ally Shiv Sena over sharing of the chief minister's post.The BJP and Shiv Sena, which contested the October 21 Maharashtra assembly poll jointly, won 105 and 56 seats respectively. The NCP and Congress have clinched 54 and 44 seats respectively.Asked about the possibility of the Shiv Sena forming government with the support of the NCP and the Congress, Pawar said there was no discussion in his party in this regard.""We do not have a clear majority. People have asked us to sit in the opposition. We accept that mandate and will take care that we play that role effectively,"" he said.The Shiv Sena has been insisting the BJP to share the chief minister's post for two-and-half years on rotational basis. The BJP is reluctant to implement such an arrangement.Referring to the sparring parties, Pawar said, ""The people have given them the opportunity (to form government). They must use it. But what is going on now (between them) is childish in my opinion.""Any party or alliance seeking to form government will require the support of at least 145 MLAs on the floor of the 288-member state assembly."

NEW DELHI: Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on has targeted Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government for investing the employees Provident Fund money in defaulter company DHFL and asked whose interest was being served by it.In a tweet, she said, ""The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh invested the money from the provident fund of the state's power corporation personnel in a defaulting company like DHFL. Whose interest was to be served by investing more than Rs 2,000 crore of the employees' hard earned money in such a company? Is it justified to play with the future of the employees?""Her remarks came after the Uttar Pradesh government's alleged dealing with controversial Mumbai company, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), caused a stir in Lucknow.In a questionable decision, the state-owned UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) has reportedly invested its employees' fund worth over Rs 2,600 crore with DHFL, whose promoters have been recently grilled by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for their links with a front company of late Iqbal Mirchi , a close aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar."

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Saturday slammed senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar for his statement that Maharashtra may head for President's rule if new government is not put in place by November 7 and sarcastically questionned the senior ally whether the President's seal was lying at its office in the state.The Sena, which is locked in a bitter battle with the BJP over sharing of power since the results of the assembly elections were declared on October 24, also dared its senior ally to stake claim to form the next government.The tenure of the current Legislative Assembly ends on November 8.Terming the the Sena's demand for chief minister's post on a rotational basis with the BJP as the ""main hurdle"" in government formation, Mungantiwar had said, ""A new government will have to be in place within the stipulated time, or else the President will have to intervene. President's rule will be imposed if the government formation doesn't happen in the given time.""Attacking Mungantiwar, the finance minister in the outgoing government, Sena said he issued the ""threat"" of imposing the President's rule, as other ""intimidation tactics"" like using investigating agencies for settling political scores have fallen flat in Maharashtra.""What the common people have to make out of the threat given by Mungantiwar? Is that supposed to mean that President of India is in our (BJP's) pocket or that the seal of the President is lying in the office of the BJP in Maharashtra?""Are these people trying to convey that the BJP could impose the President's rule in Maharashtra using that seal in the event of that party not able to form its government?"" the Sena questionned in the edit in the party mouthpiece ""Saamana"".The Marathi editorial titled ""Insult to Maharashtra, Is President in your pocket?"" described Mungantiwar's comments ""undemocratic and unconstitutional.""""The statement shows the lack of knowledge about the Constitution andthe rule of law. This threat might be a move to sidestep the established norms and get things done the way one wants. This statement is an insult to the mandate of the people,"" the party said.In the October 21 assembly polls, the BJP failed to perform up to the mark though it emerged as the single largest party by winning 105 seats, 17 less than the 2014 tally, in the 288-member House. The ally Sena won 56 seats, 7 less than its 2014 performance.The halfway mark in the Legislative Assembly is 145.""The attitude that only we willrule irrespective of numbers and no one else can attempt formation of the government was defeated in the recent elections,"" the Sena said.The edit further said that those talking about the President's rule should first stake claim to form the government in the state.""The President is the supreme authority in the Constitution. It is not about individual but the country. The country is not in anybody's pocket,"" the editorial said.The Sena also said it should not be blamed for the present impasse over formation of the government.""There is no morality left in public life,"" it said.Interestingly, Sharad Pawar-led NCP too on Friday criticised Mungantiwar's statement as a ""kind of threat.""The Sena's fresh attack on the BJP on Saturday is likely to further strain the soured relations between both the parties.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party has been demanding the CM's post for 2.5 years and 50:50 division of portfolios, as the BJP's tally took a beating in the polls.Both these demands have been rejected by the BJP which has insisted that Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will continue to hold the post for the next five years.Thackeray had reportedly said that other options (read NCP and Congress) are available for his party.However, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP, which won 54 seats in the polls, had said that it would sit in the Opposition.The Congress, which has 44 MLAs, seems to have adopted a wait-and-watch policy.Top Congress leaders from Maharashtra on Friday held meetings in Delhi and discussed the situation with party president Sonia Gandhi."

NEW DELHI: Describing Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as a stalwart of the Congress who was strongly opposed to the RSS , party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday said she felt happy seeing the BJP's attempts to ""adopt"" the ""Iron Man of India"" as it showed that the saffron party did not have a great freedom fighter of its own.Her attack on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came on a day the government organised a series of events across the country to mark the birth anniversary of Patel, the first home minister of the country.""Sardar Patel was a stalwart of the Congress who was devoted to the ideology of the party,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.He was a close companion of Jawaharlal Nehru , the first prime minister of the country, and was strongly opposed to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the BJP, the Congress general secretary said.""Today, seeing the BJP trying to adopt him and pay tributes to him gives a lot of happiness, because two things are clear from this action of the BJP: 1. It has no great freedom fighter of its own. Almost all of them were associated with the Congress. 2. Even enemies have to bow before great men like Sardar Patel one day,"" she added."

BENGALURU: As the BJP government in Karnataka led by him is all set to complete 100 days in office on November 2, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Wednesday expressed confidence about completing his full term.Rejecting suggestions that the party high command was trying to control him, the chief minister said he has been given a ""free hand"".""How I have run the administration in 100 days, what all issues I have faced, you know better than me.It is the duty of the chief minister and a leader to steer the administration ahead amid all this. I'm doing my duty. I'm trying to take everyone together, whether it is ruling side or opposition,"" Yediyurappa told reporters here.Expressing confidence that he will be hundred per cent successful in his efforts, he said, ""I will complete my remaining three-and-half-year term. I'm confident about it.I can only tell you that central leaders have confidence in me, that is the reason I have been made the chief minister of this state.""He said he was confident that he would get complete cooperation from party MPs, MLAs and workers to complete the term.Yediyurappa was responding to a question about his 100 days in power not being a ""happy one"" with natural calamities and trouble within the party besides the party high command trying to ""control him"", during a meet-the-press organised by the Press Club Of Bengaluru and Reporters Guild.Yediyurappa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time on July 26, three days after the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) government with the defeat of the motion of confidence moved by the then chief minister H D Kumaraswamy in the assembly by 99-105 votes.There has been several claims by opposition and sections of the media about Yediyurappa not completing his full term in office citing his age as the reason and also speculation about the collapse of the governemnt and possibility of mid-term polls in the state.Rejecting reports of attempts by the party leadership to control him, citing cabinet expansion among other things as example, where the BJP high command allegedly had a complete say, Yediyurappa said he has been given a ""free hand.""""Ours is a national party we have to work under certain limitations that is the expectation of our central leadership. But, our central leaders have not uttered even a word of opposition to decisions I have taken.I have been given a free hand..There has been no obstruction so far from the cabinet or any other matter,"" he said.The challenge before his administration is the coming bypolls to 15 assembly constituencies int he state, Yediyurappa said.""We will have to win at least 12-13 seats,we will try to win all the 15 seats, that is the major challenge ahead of us.Along with that we will have to address the needs ofthe people affected by floods,"" he said.Bypolls to 15 of 17 seats represented by disqualified MLAs, whose resignation and absence from the trust vote led to the fall of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government,and made way for the BJP to come to power, will be held on December 5.The then Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar had disqualified them as MLAs, ruling that those disqualified, cease to be MLAs with immediate effect till the expiry of the 15th assembly (in 2023), which they have challenged in the Supreme Court, and the matter is currently being heard by the top Court.On inducting Congress-JD(S)disqualified MLAs into the party and giving them ticket and discontent within the party against it, Yediyurappa said ""We have not taken any decision; it will all depend on what the party central leadership decides.""""Supreme Court is likely to decide on the petition of disqualified MLAs on November 4 or 5, after that we will decide,"" he said.He claimed that all sections of people were with him. ""...that's the reason I could become Chief Minister.""The BJP needs to win at least six seats in the bypolls to 15 constituencies to remain in a majority in the 224-member assembly, which will still have two vacant seats — Maski and R R Nagar."

MUMBAI ( MAHARASHTRA ): NCP leader Praful Patel on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of giving support to either BJP or Shiv Sena in the state and asserted that a tussle between the two parties over the government formation is only a ""show-off"".""The atmosphere was different during 2014 Assembly polls and is different now in 2019. That time, all parties were contesting elections on their own. But this time we fought elections with our alliance partners and will go ahead with them. NCP will not support BJP,"" he told reporters here.He also stated that people's mandate for NCP is to sit in the opposition and BJP-Shiv Sena should sort out their differences.""Whatever going with Shiv Sena and BJP is just a show-off and they will form the government. They should form the government. If they have differences then they should sort it out. We don't want to speak to any of the parties. The people's mandate is for us to sit in the Opposition. If the situation changes, then we will see,"" Patel added.The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won an absolute majority in the Maharashtra Assembly polls with the former emerging as the single-largest party with 105 seats. Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats in the elections. The alliance is yet to sort out their differences over the government formation in the state.After the polls, Shiv Sena is adamant about the implementation of the 50:50 formula proposed by BJP during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The formula is a rotational arrangement in which a Chief Minister from each party will split the five-year term equally.Shiv Sena has got the support of at least five independent MLAs including Prahar Janshakti Party chief Bacchu Kadu, his party MLA Rajkumar Patel, Ashish Jaiswal, Narendra Bhondekar and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-backed independent MLA Shankarrao Gadakh.Till now at least five Independent MLAs including Chandrapur MLA Kishor JorgewarJorgewar, Jan Surajya Shakti chief Vinay Kore , Mahesh Baldi, Vinod Agrawal and rebel BJP MLA Geeta Jain have announced their support to BJP, which emerged as the single largest party in the recently concluded polls."

NEW DELHI: Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Monday left for abroad, days ahead of his party's planned protests against the Central government on the economic slowdown in the country.According to sources, the Congress leader's visit is scheduled for a week and he will come back to India in the first week of November and will join the protest then.The Congress will hold 35 press conferences between November 1 and 8, and will also hold protests from November 5 to 15 to highlight the country's current economic situation.Senior party leaders will address these press conferences from November 5 to 15 from district to state level and a major show has been planned in Delhi where other opposition parties have also been invited. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal in a statement, on October 23, had said that protests would be organised in districts and state capitals, which would be culminating in a massive programme in the national capital.""It may be recalled that the decision in this regard was taken at the meeting headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with senior leaders, party office bearers and Incharges, Congress CMs and PCC presidents and CLP leaders on 12/13 September, but the earlier schedule of the programme slated between October 15 to October 25 had to be postponed because of the just-concluded assembly elections,"" read the statement.Earlier in the first week of October, Gandhi had gone out of the country while the party was campaigning in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly Polls. However, he addressed rallies in both states."

KOLKATA: The November 25 by-polls to three assembly seats in West Bengal will be the first litmus test for the TMC and the BJP since the Lok Sabha polls in the state.The byelections will be an indication of which way political winds are blowing in the state.It will be the first electoral contest between the BJP and TMC since this year's parliamentary polls, in which the saffron party bagged 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, four less than that of the ruling Trinamool Congress.The BJP is attempting to unseat the Mamata Banerjee government from power in the state.The by-polls are scheduled to be held in Kharagpur Sadar seat in West Midnapore district, Karimpur in Nadia and Kaliaganj in Uttar Dinajpur which are presently held by the BJP, TMC and the Congress respectively.The Kaliaganj seat fell vacant after the death of sitting Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy while Kharagpur's BJP MLA Dilip Ghosh won the Medinipur Lok Sabha constituency.TMC's Karimpur MLA Mahua Moitra emerged victorious from the Krishnnanagar Lok Sabha seat.The by-polls ahead of the 2021 state assembly election will have political ramifications in West Bengal as it will be held in the backdrop of the BJP's performance in the recent Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls and in the shadow of the proposed implementation of NRC and tabling of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament.For the BJP, the challenge is to live up to its performance in the parliamentary polls, whereas the TMC will try to regain its lost political ground.The by-polls will also decide if the opposition Congress and the CPM, which have come together after three years, will remain relevant in the state politics or become redundant.The Congress bagged two seats and the CPM drew a blank in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in the state.As the BJP increased its tally from two seats in 2014 to 18 seats in 2019 by bagging 40.5 per cent votes, the TMC witnessed a massive slump in its number of seats down from 34 in 2014 to 22 this time.""We are confident of winning all the three assembly seats in the by-polls. The people of West Bengal have made up their mind to defeat the TMC in 2021 assembly polls in the state,"" West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh told PTI.According to a section of state BJP leaders, the party's failure to get the majority in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls and a resurgent Congress in the northern state have not gone down well with its ranks in West Bengal.""In the Lok Sabha polls, we had swept Haryana and Maharashtra. But in less than six months, the result of the assembly polls shows that although Narendra Modi as Prime Minister is unchallenged at the national level, the same cannot be said for the state leaders when it comes to assembly elections.""So we are bit apprehensive that the same trend may not continue in West Bengal,"" a senior state BJP leader said on condition of anoynimity.The BJP also feels that the by-polls in Karimpur and Kaliaganj seats, which have considerable Muslim and dalit population, will be a litmus test for the party, post the publication of the final national register of citizens (NRC) list in Assam.Most of the dalits in the two seats are refugees, and their descendants, from erstwhile East Pakistan who fled to India during Partition and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.The BJP is mooting to imnplement NRC in West Bengal after coming to power in the state.The saffron party, which had gone to the Lok Sabha elections with the NRC, illegal infiltration from Bangladesh and alleged Muslim appeasement by the TMC government as its poll planks, is in the backfoot since the publication of the final NRC list in Assam, where names of over 19 lakh people mostly Hindus had been omitted, a senior party leader said.""The panic that followed the NRC exercise in Assam has taken the winds out of the BJP's sails to some extent. So in order to counter the narrative of the TMC on the NRC, we had come up with the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 in which we said, all Hindu refugees will be accorded citizenship. It has to be seen which narrative gets accepted in Karimpur and Kaliaganj,"" the BJP leader said.The Trinamool Congress, through its mass outreach campaign 'Didi ke Bolo' (Tell Didi) over the last three months, hopes that it has revived much of its lost ground and the by-polls will reflect it.""The people of West Bengal in the last five-six months have understood that the BJP is a communal and divisive force. In the by-polls, we will win all the seats as the people of the state have faith in Mamata Banerjee.""Apart from local issues and rural distress due to the Centre's economic policies, the TMC in its campaign for the by-polls will highlight the BJP's threat of imposing NRC in the state which will turn legal citizens into refugees,"" TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said.With both the parties fighting for their political exsistence in Bengal, the Congress and the CPM-led Left Front, have sealed seat adjustment for the by-polls.The Congress will contest Kaliaganj and Kharagpur Sadar seats, while the Left Front will fight from Karimpur.""We are hopeful that with both the CPM and the Congress fighting together, people will realize that the Congress-CPM alliance can be the only alternative to the TMC, as a communal force like the BJP will never be accepted in the state,"" Congress state president Somen Mitra said."

MUMBAI: Amid bickering between the BJP and Shiv Sena over sharing of power in the next Maharashtra government, an NCP leader has come out with a cartoon taking a dig at the current state of affairs between the two ruling parties.In the cartoon, released by NCP spokesperson Clyde Crasto on Tuesday, the Shiv Sena's poll symbol 'bow and arrow' is seen hanging over the BJP's symbol 'lotus'.The arrow is directed at the lotus in the cartoon.""There is a saying, hanging over the head...,"" the cartoon caption reads in Marathi.In Marathi, there is a saying ""dokyavarati tangati talwar"", which is equivalent to the English phrase - 'sword of Damocles hangs over head', implying that something bad is in the offing or one is faced with a threat.The Shiv Sena on Tuesday cancelled its meeting with the BJP on government formation, hours after Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis denied that the Uddhav Thackeray- led party wasassured the CM's post for two-and-half years as part of apower sharing formula.Ever since results of the October 21 assembly polls were out, Thackeray has been claiming that the 50:50 formula on sharing of power was ""agreed upon"" between himself, BJP president Amit Shah and Fadnavis ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.However, according to sources in the BJP, the discussion and agreement reached with the Sena on formalising the alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha polls was on ""equitable distribution of power and not on the post of the chief minister.""The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the recently-concluded Maharashtra assembly polls by winning 105 seats, much below the 145 halfway mark in the 288-member House.The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress bagged 56, 54 and 44seats, respectively."

MUMBAI: Maharashtra is stuck in a peculiar state where the two pre-poll allies have enough numbers to form government, yet none of them has staked its claim. On the other hand, the BJP that fell short of six seats in Haryana cobbled up the numbers in a couple of days.The point of contention remains the distribution of key portfolios and sharing the Chief Minister's post, which the BJP has refused to part with. As Shiv Sena called off Tuesday's meeting with BJP General Secretary and close aide of Amit Shah Bhupendra Yadav, who was tasked to negotiate with the Sena, here are the ways Mission 145 can be achieved (Maharashtra Assembly has 288 seats).Let's start with the most improbable scenario. The BJP has bagged 105 seats on its own in the 288-member House. It needs 40 more seats to be able to form a government on its own, regardless of Sena. If the BJP is able to bag all 13 independents, which looks tough at the moment for BJP, the number goes up to 118. The saffron party would still need 27 seats. But all smaller parties, which includes the BJP's ideological adversary All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and CPI(M) - all put together are coming at 16. In that rarest of the rare situation where the BJP will have even Owaisi and Yechury backing BJP, the saffron party can't form the government on its own.Possibility: ImpossibleIf Scenario 1 was most improbable, this one is the most probable. Even on Tuesday night, BJP's Bhupendra Yadav and Chandarkant Dada Patil were slated to come on the negotiating table with Sena's Sanjay Raut and Subhash Desai, which now stands called off. The Sena and BJP are known to be warring partners who have done business with each other in spite of the Sena's mouthpiece targeting none less than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Given its track record, and also the way the two sealed a deal after more than a month of negotiation before 2019 general election, Sena-BJP government is the most practical scenario where both together have 160 seats, 15 above the halfway mark. A BJP Union minister who has family relationship with Matoshree, the residence of Thackerays, insisted that he is hopeful Scenario 2 will emerge as the final scenario.Possibility: Most likelyThis sounds ideologically off track but politics, as they say, is an art of exploring improbabilities. With 54 seats of Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party and 44 seats of Indian National Congress giving outside support to a Shiv Sena government, for the first time ever a Thackeray can be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, a state where young Aditya's grandfather was known to be the kingmaker.Given the acrimonious relationship with the BJP, it easy for Congress to lend outside support to even Shiv Sena to keep BJP away. Congress MP Hussain Dalwai told IANS, ""We can think of supporting Sena, but it has to take the call first"".And the dragging of Pawar's name in the cooperative bank Scam just ahead of the state election that pumped in a new lease of life in the 79-year-old leader to fight the BJP also provides good enough reason to Sharad Pawar to lend outside support to an Aditya Thackeray-led government where BJP will sit in the opposition.Possibility: UnlikelyIn 2014, BJP ran a short minority government when Shiv Sena acted pricey. For days, Sena sat in the opposition side as Pawar's NCP provided a breather to Fadnavis-led BJP's minority government. Given the situation today, it's a deja vu for the state and the party. Also, given ED's allegations against Sharad and Ajit Pawar, an outside support to a minority BJP government can make things easy for the Pawar duo.So, what scenario will emerge as the final scenario? BJP's Mumbai Spokesperson Suresh Nakhua told IANS, ""There's a saying which goes like this: 'If you are with us, with you. If you are not with us, without you. If you are against us, in spite of you.' It will be BJP government and BJP CM, I can assure you. Rest is all are meaningless.""Possibility: Remote"

NEW DELHI: BJP and one of its oldest alliance partners Shiv Sena are on a collision course once again. On this occasion it is over the chief minister's post in Maharashtra where BJP emerged as the single largest party winning 105 seats in the 288-member state assembly. Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats.From the very day the results were announced on October 24, Shiv Sena has been laying claim to the chief minister’s post.Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray and its senior leader Sanjay Raut have been reminding BJP of the “50:50 formula” which, they claim, was decided before the Lok Sabha election.Thackeray and Raut have gone on record to state that Maharashtra’s caretaker chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced the 50:50 formula in the presence of BJP president Amit Shah in a press conference held at Mumbai.However, a revisit to the video clip mentioned by Uddhav Thackeray and Sanjay Raut does not find any explicit reference to the 50:50 formula for the chief minister’s post.A joint press conference of BJP and Shiv Sena leaders was held on February 18 after the two parties entered into a seat-sharing arrangement for the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. It was addressed by Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray and Amit Shah - in that order.In his address, Fadnavis first spoke in Marathi and then in Hindi. In his address, he said, “Today BJP and Shiv Sena have decided to come together once again in Maharashtra and at the national level. We have been together for the last 25 years.”Fadnavis admitted that due to some reasons the two parties could not remain allies in the 2014 assembly election. “Despite this, we ran the governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra as NDA partners,” he said.The then Maharashtra chief minister said there would have been differences between BJP and Shiv Sena over some issues. “However, both the parties are nationalists and follow Hindutva. At a time when attempts are being made to challenge the nationalist ideologies, it is quite natural that the nationalist parties join hands and accept the challenges in the interest of the nation and the society.”Towards that end, Fadnavis said, it was decided that BJP and Shiv Sena would contest the Lok Sabha and the (Maharashtra) assembly elections together. BJP would fight on 25 seats and Shiv Sena on 23 in the Lok Sabha election, he declared.Fadnavis further said, “In the assembly election, we (BJP and Shiv Sena) will contest on equal number of seats after excluding the seats of other alliance partners.”He said they were confident that the Narendra Modi-led NDA government would return to power “because of the extremely good work it has done in the last five years”. BJP, Shiv Sena and other alliance partners would also retain power in Maharashtra, he said.On the contentious issue of sharing power, which has become the bone of contention between BJP and Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said, “Aur ismein is sarkar ke aane ke baad pud aur zimmedaariyan ye samaan roop se iska nirvahan hum log karengey, ye bhi nirnay humne yahaan par liya hua hai. (It has also been decided that once we come back to power, we will equally share the responsibilities and posts).”On October 29, Fadnavis reiterated that BJP had never promised the CM's post for two-and-a-half years to Shiv Sena when the alliance was sealed before the 2019 Lok Sabha election. “The Shiv Sena was not promised CM's post for two-and-a-half years when the alliance was formalised before the Lok Sabha polls,"" he told mediapersons at his official residence 'Varsha' at Mumbai.In Video: Maharashtra power tussle: Shiv Sena shares CM's 'role-sharing' clip"

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Ghulam Nabi Azad on Tuesday took a jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for begging before independent MLAs to form government in Maharashtra.""I want to congratulate the voters of India for the recent election results. Be it Haryana and Maharashtra assembly election or the by-polls, BJP has completely lost. They are begging before others like Chautala and independents to form a government. They haven't even formed government in Maharashtra,"" he said while addressing a gathering in the national capital.Azad also said that the BJP lost two-thirds of the assembly by-polls held across the country.""People have rejected the BJP's new formula of throwing missiles before the elections to get votes. People have real issues like farmers' suicide, unemployment and law and order. But the BJP does not care about these issues,"" he said.""BJP does not care about the lakhs of people, who lost their livelihood due to demonetisation or the crores of rupees the people lost due to GST . Petrol prices are soaring. The government is taking money from the Reserve Bank,"" added Azad.The Congress leader said the BJP has come to power only to fight elections.""They even fight elections in their dreams. They only talk about election strategies during the working hours in their offices and ministries,"" he said.Azad said that this is a fight for democracy.""If there was democracy in the country, what happened to Kashmir would not have happened. They bring bills to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha from '(secret doors). They are practising dictatorship in the Parliament, the temple of democracy,"" added Azad."

MUMBAI: Hours after Maharashtra chief ministerthe Shiv Sena was assured post of the CM for 2.5 years as part of a power sharing ""formula"", Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday cancelled his party's meeting with the BJP on formation of the next government.The development might potentially worsen the already strained relationship between the two parties.A senior Sena leader told PTI the meet, scheduled to be held here at 4pm, was cancelled by Thackeray after the CM's statement on sharing of power.The meeting was to be attended by Union minister Prakash Javadekar and senior Sena leaders.""Union minister Prakash Javdekar and party leader Bhupendra Yadav were supposed to attend the meeting to start discussions on formation of the next government from the BJP side, while the Sena would have been represented by Subhash Desai and Sanjay Raut ,"" the Sena leader said.The development came within hours of Fadnavis' presser in which he denied that the Sena was ever promised the CM's post for two-and-a-half years when the alliance was formalised before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls Thackeray has been insisting that the 50:50 formula on sharing of power was ""agreed upon"" between himself, BJP chief Amit Shah and Fadnavis ahead of the Lok Sabha polls this year.The Sena had demanded a written assurance from the BJP for implementing ""equal formula for sharing of power"" before holding talks on staking the claim to form the next alliance government in the state.On Tuesday, the Sena also released an old video clip to ""rebut"" the CM's claims on sharing of power in which the latter purportedly talked about equal sharing of posts and responsibilities in the BJP-led state government.""Uddhavji has cancelled the meeting scheduled at 4 pm on Tuesday. We have sent out the clip of the CM speaking about sharing posts and responsibilities equally. Fadnavis should mind his words while making such statements,"" the senior leader added.In a related development earlier in the day, Fadnavis announced that Shah will not be attending the BJP legislature party meeting on Wednesday.A BJP leader had last week said that Shah might visit Thackeray.Ever since the BJP's tally fell in the recently-held assembly polls, results for which were announced on October 24, the Sena raised its pitch for a rotational chief ministership between the two parties for a period of 2.5 years.Sena MLAs last week demanded that Thackeray's son Aaditya, a first-time legislator, be made the chief minister.In the elections held for the 288-member House, the BJP won 105 seats, a loss of 17 seats compared to its 2014 tally.The Sena's tally also came down to 56 seats from 63 in 2014.

NEW DELHI: Janata Dal (Secular) president H D Deve Gowda has dismissed any possibility of having an electoral tie-up with either the Congress or the BJP for December 5 bypolls in Karnataka, describing both the national parties as ""not trustworthy"" and having the ""same character"".In an interview to PTI on Tuesday, the former prime minister said JD(S) would contest the bypolls to fill 15 vacancies in Karnataka Assembly alone and ""certainly maintain equidistance"" from the Congress and the BJP.The veteran politician also said he was in fact reluctant to have a tie-up with Congress after the May 2018 Karnataka election.""It was the Congress which came to me after the election and persuaded us for formation of Congress-JD(S) government. Initially I did not agree but after prolonged persuasion by the Congress I accepted (the alliance),"" Deve Gowda said.Asked about JD (S)'s strategy for the bypolls, the 86-year-old JD(S) patriarch quipped, ""We have nothing to do with Congress and BJP. Both of them are not trustworthy. They will use us when they want and destroy us later. Both the parties are of the same character"".""There is no question of JD(S) having any electoral tie-up with any of these two parties — Congress or the BJP — and we will go alone,"" Deve Gowda reiterated.Asked if he was softening towards the BJP in view of exchange of tweets of appreciation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he replied in the negative: ""Nothing like that.""The bypolls are necessitated due to the disqualification of 17 legislators of Congress and JD(S) under the anti-defection law by the then Speaker of Karnataka Assembly.The MLAs later filed a petition in the Supreme Court on which the order is reserved.The EC has announced the poll schedule for only 15 of the 17 constituencies. It could not do so for Maski and Rajarajeshwari Nagar segments as petitions are pending in the Karnataka High Court relating to 2018 assembly poll.Winning a majority of seats in the bypolls is necessary for the ruling BJP led by B S Yeddyurappa to stay in power.The constituencies polling on December 5 are: Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Yellapura, Hirekerur, Ranibennur, Vijaynagara, Chickballapura, K R Pura, Yeshwanthpura, Mahalakshmi Layout, Shivajinagara, Hosakote, K R Pete and Hunsur."

MUMBAI: On a day Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis denied the BJP ever promised to share the chief minister's post with the ally Shiv Sena , the Uddhav Thackeray-led party came up with an old video of the CM in which he purportedly talked about equal sharing of posts and responsibilities in the state government.Ever since the BJP's tally fell in the recently-held assembly polls, results for which were announced on October 24, the Sena raised its pitch for a rotational chief ministership between the two parties for a period of 2.5 years.Sena MLAs last week demanded that Thackeray's son Aaditya, a first-time legislator, be made the chief minister.With the Sena hardening its position, the formal deliberations over formation of the next government are yet to take-off, despite the BJP and the Thackeray-led party having adequate numbers to cross the halfway mark in the 288-member House.Breaking his silence on the issue, Fadnavis on Tuesday said BJP chief Amit Shah never promised the CM's post for two-and-a-half years to the Sena when the alliance was formalised before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Seeking to rebut the CM's claims, Sena has released a video clip on social media of his press conference dated February 18 this year.The clip with a caption ""Jara Yaad karo Jabani"" (Remember the assurance) was put out by Harshal Pradhan, a close aide of Uddhav Thackeray ""We have decided equal sharing of posts and responsibilities once we come to power again,"" Fadnavis is quoted as saying in Marathi at the presser to announce tie-up for (Lok Sabha) elections.Thackeray had last week reminded the BJP of the 50:50 formula ""agreed upon"" between himself, Shah and Fadnavis ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.The Sena demanded a written assurance from the BJP for implementing ""equal formula for sharing of power"" before holding talks on staking the claim to form the next alliance government in the state.On Tuesday, Fadnavis, who is the only second chief minister in the state to complete the full five-year term, asserted he will be at the helm once again.In Video: Maharashtra power tussle: Shiv Sena shares CM's 'role-sharing' clip"

NEW DELHI: Never before has Congress appeared as eager to raise an agitation against the Modi government as now.Barely a month after deciding to hold an agitation, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will on Saturday hold a top-level party meeting to emphasise the importance of the nationwide protest planned between November 5-15.She will chair a gathering of AICC general secretaries, heads of departments and frontal organisations. Sou- rces said the discussion is likely to take stock of the state-wide plan for protests.On the backfoot after the Lok Sabha rout at the hands of BJP, the opposition party believes that it can tap into the present economic slowdown and dip into unemployment to generate a grassroots anger against the BJP government besides using it to activate the rusted party units.Last week, Congress announced its opposition to Regional Comprehensive Economic Programme, a mega trade deal with ASEAN countries and other big economies including China. The party has said it will endanger domestic industries, especially dairy and fishery sectors, and urged other opposition parties to forge a “common agitational platform” against RCEP.The mega trade deal is likely to be blended with economic slowdown as the agenda of protest which will see every state unit down to district level take to streets.It is believed the opposition did much better than expected in recent assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra because of the economic distress. Congress sources said the party wants to try and exploit this rare opportunity in the time of BJP’s ascendance.At the end of the 10-day programme, a public rally is likely to be organised in the capital to amplify the theme of economic woes. That it would come just before the winter session of Parliament starting on November 18 appears well calculated.The party is betting so heavily on the agitation that it is putting in place an unprecedented monitoring mechanism. Every state is being assigned a central AICC observer to finalise and execute the protest plan.After Sonia took over as “interim president” following Rahul’s resignation owning “moral responsibility” for the Lok Sabha rout, she held a meeting of AICC general secretaries and state leaders on September 12 where political challenges and the way forward was discussed. The agitation plan was finalised at that meeting."

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the opposition performing better than expected in Haryana and Maharashtra elections, Congress has decided to seal an election alliance with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) for Jharkhand assembly elections, putting to rest the indications of breakup after the Lok Sabha rout.The alliance, sources said, is likely to be clinched without much fuss and would be finalised before the process for assembly polls gains momentum.Sources said the initial talks between Congress and JMM have removed the post-LS confusion and resulted in an in-principle decision on election partnership.The discussions on seatsharing would start soon. Congress would be the junior partner to JMM and may settle for 25-30 seats in the house of 81. Uncertainty looms over JVM of Babulal Marandi joining the fold though talks are on with the party.In the LS polls, BJP swept the state across regions, decimating the “grand alliance” of JMM-Congress-JVM.While BJP is seen as positioned way ahead of its rivals for the assembly contest, the opposition is taking hope from the performance of Congress in Haryana where it ran the ruling party close. Even in Maharashtra, where NCP and Congress were seriously hobbled by lack of personnel following months of defections to BJP, the opposition was not decimated as was expected by the ruling camp.The lessons drawn by opposition strategists from the recent assembly polls are that electorate may be differentiating between national and assembly polls, and that BJP can be challenged in states despite its parliamentary landslide.It is the only source of optimism for opposition whose expectations in Jharkhand were dashed by the Modi juggernaut few months ago.Moreover, like Haryana and Maharashtra, BJP in Ranchi has an unconventional chief minister in Raghubar Das , a non-tribal in what is viewed as a tribal state.The JMM-Congress alliance seeks to mobilise the tribals under the Sorens while hoping to eat away at the OBC and upper caste votes through the national party. The two allies are likely to revert focus to “tenancy law amendments” that the Das government had to roll back under sustained pressure from the tribal agitation."

SRINAGAR: Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Ghulam Nabi Azad has vacated his rent-free government accommodation in Srinagar's VVIP zone, which used to be a lifetime perk guaranteed to all former chief ministers of J&K till the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A took away the state's special status.Azad, who was the CM from November 2005 to July 2008, had retained the use of a J&K Bank guesthouse at Zeethyar on Gupkar Road all these years, although he doesn't live in Srinagar. ""We have been told that the former CM has vacated our guesthouse, but the administration hasn't handed over the property to us yet,” a senior J&K Bank official told TOI.Former CMs Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah , both of whom have been in detention since August 5, remain in official possession of large, well-appointed government properties on Gupkar Road. Both will have to vacate these bungalows by November 1, sources said.The estates department has drawn up an inventory each of all government assets in the two bungalows, including furniture, gadgets and gym equipment, in preparation for the change.The former CMs had enjoyed lifetime use of government properties and amenities by virtue of the Jammu and Kashmir State Legislature Members' Pension Act, 1984, which was amended multiple times till 1996 to include more perks and privileges. These benefits will cease to exist on November 1, when the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill 2019 takes effect. Farooq Abdullah is the only living former CM who does not occupy a government property. But the National Conference chief, detained in his private residence under the Public Safety Act, continues to enjoy free medical care, transport and other perks.Every former CM with the exception of Azad has spent crores of rupees on modernising or renovating their official bungalows to suit their requirements. Omar's bungalow has a modern gym, among other frills.Hari Niwas Palace on Gupkar Road, which security forces had infamously used as an ""interrogation centre"" at the peak of militancy in J&K, has been Omar's temporary home since he was escorted there on the morning of August 5 and detained under Section 107 of the CrPC.A source said he was being occasionally served ""home-cooked food"" and his choice of pizza and green salad twice a week. ""We have also been providing a set of the latest Hollywood releases for his entertainment once every two weeks."""

MUMBAI: Shankarrao Gadakh, an NCP-backed Independent MLA in Maharashtra, on Monday offered support to the Shiv Sena , which is pushing for an equal share in power with ally BJP in the next government.The MLA from Nevasa in Ahmedanagar district made the announcement after meeting Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray at his residence here.Gadakh's father Yashwantrao was a former NCP leader.""I represent a rural area where problems are more complicated. If I have to solve people's issues, it is better to stay with the party which is going to form the government.""Hence, I visited Mumbai today and extended support to the Sena,"" he said.The Sena, which won 56 seats in the October 21 assembly polls, claimed its tally now stood at 61 with the support of five more MLAs.The BJP and the Shiv Sena, with 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member House, are busy wooing the 13 Independent MLAs in the state to give themselves an upper hand during discussions for formation of the next government.In a related development, two Independent MLAs - Ravi Rana (Badnera in Amravati district) and Kishor Jorgewar (Chandrapur) - have declared support to the BJP.The Sena has demanded a written assurance from the BJP for implementing ""equal formula for sharing of power"", which could possibly include equal division of the chief ministerial tenure.Speaking to a news channel on Monday, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, ""We will see how they do not share the post of chief minister. Both the parties agreed on 50:50 power- sharing formula. There is no need to explain it in detail."""

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday upped the ante against ally BJP , saying his party should not be compelled to look for an alternative to form the next government in Maharashtra and asserted there are ""no saints in politics"".The BJP and the Sena, with 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the new assembly, are locked in a bitter tussle over sharing of power.Ever since the results were announced on October 24, there have been statements from sections in the Congress-NCP, though not officially, hinting that a move by the Sena to look beyond the BJP for government formation may get positive feelers.Speaking to a news channel, Raut said, ""We believe in the alliance (with BJP) as we contested the polls jointly. But the BJP should not compel us to commit the sin of looking for an alternative for government formation.""""No one is a saint in politics,"" he added, possibly a hint to the senior ally that committing such a ""sin"" was not entirely unfathomable for the Sena.Raut claimed the two parties had agreed on an ""equal power"" sharing formula and had even made an announcement on it in Mumbai.""Ahead of the assembly polls, the BJP requested Sena for more share of seats because of large number of turncoats. ""Sena chief (Uddhav) Thackeray agreed to it, hence they contested on 164 seats and the Sena on 124,"" Raut explained, adding, ""We never lie in politics, even if it is for gaining power"".Queried on a scenario where the BJP goes ahead alone and stakes claim to form the government, he said, ""The BJP is the single largest party at present in the state. If they can provide a majority government without the Sena's help, I welcome it.""Hardening stand on equal division of the chief ministerial tenure, Raut said, ""We will see how they do not share the post of chief minister. Both the parties agreed on 50:50 power-sharing formula. There is no need to explain it in detail.""Raut claimed there has been no discussion so far between the BJP and Sena on government formation.Raut is the chief whip of the party in Parliament and executive editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamana."

NEW DELHI: CPM general-secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday questioned why members of the European Parliament were being ""welcomed"" in Jammu and Kashmir when Indian political leaders had been prevented from doing so.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday told a delegation of European Union MPs that urgent action was needed against those supporting and sponsoring terrorism. The delegation is scheduled to visit the state on Tuesday.""Then why were Indian political party leaders and MPs repeatedly prevented from exiting Srinagar airport? I was allowed to enter Srinagar only when the Supreme Court permitted over my habeas corpus petition. Even today Indian MPs are not allowed while Modi welcomes MEPs!,"" Yechury tweeted.Yechury and CPI general secretary D Raja were not allowed to visit the state after the abrogation of Article 370 despite repeated attempts. Yechury was allowed to visit his ailing party colleague Yusuf Tarigami after the SC gave its go ahead on the condition that he would not be part of any political activity there.""The fact that the Indian government is facilitating the visit of the EU delegation shows that this government is desperate and is under pressure to please the international community which has raised several questions on human rights violations in J&K. The government is desperate to convince the global community. While it says everything is normal in the region, the ground reality is different,"" said Raja.CPI leader Atul Anjaan alleged that PM Modi was trying to ""internationalise"" the Kashmir issue by welcoming the delegation of the European Union. He alleged that foreign citizens were being sent to Kashmir by the Indian government.He further said that all the claims of the government on J&K was ""false""."

BENGALURU: Senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid said on Monday the outcome of Haryana and Maharashtra elections indicates that his party's slide in the country has stopped and it can now look forward to reversing the tide.The party has now come out of a bad period of confusion and self-doubt, the former Union minister said, obviously referring to the party's poor show in the Lok Sabha elections Rahul Gandhi quitting as the party president and some leaders deserting in a few states.Terming the election results in the two states as ""encouraging"", he said the party workers are very pleased.In Haryana, the Congress doubled its 2014 tally, and it Maharashtra, the Congress-NCP alliance improved its tally considerably.""It (the election results) gives them (Congress workers) a second breath and I think it's a remainder to all of us in the Congress that there is a lot of life in us and what we need to do now is to get back on our feet and fight with faith and conviction,"" Khurshid told PTI.""I think it's a clear indication that there is no further slide and we can start reversing the tide"", he said, adding the Congress now needs clarity of purpose.Khurshid said the Congress has an outstanding manifesto but in public performances there needs to be clarity of purpose.He added that departing from manifesto and taking contradictory positions are some things that need to be avoided.""We need a clarity of unity and purpose and I hope that we will be able to show that,"" Khurshid said.Asked if the Congress would have put up a much better show had it made more efforts before the elections in the two states, he said that's always the case.""We were coming out of a very bad period, we had obviously lot of confusion, self-doubt etc. I think all that haze has cleared and we can see the path clear again,"" he said.On some reports before the elections in Haryana and Maharashtra that the verdict is going to be one-sided with BJP projected to win and the Congress not putting up a fight, Khurshid said it was a perception created by a section of the media and there was no lack of conviction in his party."

KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar spent two hours at chief minister Mamata Banerjee ’s Kalighat residence on Sunday evening during Kali Puja ceremonies. “Anyone who comes to a Puja comes with a pure heart and leaves it with a purer heart,” he said while leaving.Dhankhar said he had a “great time” at the CM’s residence, adding, “Our gestures fully matched”.The governor’s presence at the CM’s home drew senior state functionaries — state education and parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee, speaker Biman Banerjee , chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha, DGP Virendra, and special security advisor (SSA) Surajit Kar Purkayastha — to her Harish Chatterjee Road residence.Dhankhar reached her home with his wife, Sudesh, around 6.10pm. Banerjee first took them to her modest room “for two minutes” before seating him where the puja was being performed. In the room, which is furnished with only a bed and three plastic chairs, she offered them seats on the chairs and had a brief conversation.The governor appeared visibly happy with her personal gesture, even more so when Banerjee personally took the panchapradip after sandhya-aarati to him and his wife. MP Abhishek Banerjee , who later performed yagna, also touched his feet. Several times, when Banerjee walked up to the puja to help with the rituals (she had been cooking the bhog in the morning), the governor was seen talking to Chatterjee and other state functionaries.Initially, when Banerjee introduced Chatterjee to the governor, the latter smiled and told the chief minister, “You know he has a daughter. I, too, have a daughter.”Dhankhar left at 8.20pm. He was scheduled to attend the puja ceremonies in Dakhineshwar later at night. “I am overwhelmed and touched,” he told the media before leaving.Raj Bhavan’s outreach to the CM comes after some instances of acrimonious wars of words. The wrangling match started escalating after the governor set a precedent by reaching out to the Jadavpur University campus to “rescue” Union minister Babul Supriyo during a students’ agitation. It became worse after Dhankhar expressed dismay over a “black-out” of the “first servant of the state” on TVs during the Durga Puja carnival on Red Road, and over the “absence” of senior state officials in districts, when he had sought meetings with them during his district tours. The CM, however, stayed away from the verbal duel, leaving it to party seniors — primarily Chatterjee, the party secretary-general — to respond to the governor’s remarks. But they also went silent after a point of time.The governor had sought the CM’s time on Bhatridwitiya on October 29. She she cited preoccupations on that day and welcomed him to her home for Kali Puja.Banerjee, who rarely steps out of her home since she started Kali Puja there in 1978, did not speak to the media. Senior party leaders, too, remained tightlipped about the governor’s visit."

JAMMU (JAMMU & KASHMIR): The people of Jammu and Kashmir are no longer victims of dual citizenship as it has been completely integrated with India, said BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav here on Saturday.""This Diwali is special for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. It is the first Diwali after complete integration of the state with India. People of Jammu and Kashmir are no more victims of dual citizenship. We all are citizens of India and we will celebrate Diwali with this pride,"" he said addressing a public gathering here.Madhav said that October 26 is also a special day for the region as on this day Maharaja Hari Singh had signed the Instrument of Accession (IoA), a legal document declaring that the region accedes to India.""However, this time around, the day is even more special as we have done what Maharaja had always intended to do. We have integrated Jammu and Kashmir with India. Article 370 and 'special status' to the region were never the intention of Maharaja Hari Singh,"" he said.He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government did not take the decision to scrap Article 370 to score any political points or for any ideological beliefs.""The decision was only taken for the welfare of the people of Jammu and Kashmir after much deliberation,"" said Madhav.The BJP leader also slammed the opposition parties for questioning the way special status to Jammu and Kashmir was repealed.""Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India in an undemocratic manner. It was the outcome of mutual understanding between two people. However, we have scrapped the Article in the most democratic way,"" said Madhav.He said that the political leaders in the region claim that they also conducted Block Development Council (BDC) elections here but did not give any power to the panchayats.""During their rule, the panchayat did not have any power. We are going to give Rs 20-25 lakh to each panchayat. We don't care which party wins and how many seats. It is our achievement that the people have participated in the BDC polls ,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Friday inched closer to form the government in Haryana after garnering the support of at least seven independent MLAs but a trickier balancing act awaits the party in Maharashtra where its ally Shiv Sena is playing hardball by demanding an equal share in the new dispensation.Sources said BJP president Amit Shah may hold parleys with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to hammer out a deal before the saffron alliance stakes claim to form the government in the western state.The BJP parliamentary board had on Thursday authorised Shah to take all decisions on the formation of new governments in the two states.Talks with Sena at the top level may happen after Diwali, sources said.Moving swiftly to ensure the support of a majority of MLAs in Haryana after its tally fell to 40 in the 90-member assembly, senior BJP leaders, including its working president J P Nadda, held parleys with Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and other senior leaders. The party has received support of seven independent MLAs.According to sources, Khattar is likely to stake claim on Saturday to form government in the state following a meeting of the BJP legislative party in Chandigarh.Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman and BJP general secretary Arun Singh will attend the legislative party meeting as central observers,In Maharashtra the BJP's job is all about placating its ally Sena.Though the saffron alliance has won a comfortable majority by winning 161 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly, the BJP's dependence on its partner is much more now as it won only 105 seats against the 122 it has in the outgoing assembly.Sena's tally also fell to 56 from 63 but its clout has increased due to the more crucial role it will have in the stability of the future NDA government.Thackeray on Thursday had reminded the BJP about the formula arrived at during his meeting with Shah ahead of Lok Sabha polls, and said they had decided on a fifty-fifty formula for the alliance in the state.""We agreed to contest fewer seats (than the BJP), but I cannot accommodate the BJP every time. I should allow my party to grow,"" Thackeray said.Keeping up the heat on its senior partner, Sena in its mouthpiece said there was no ""maha janadesh"" as the BJP had claimed before the results were announced and that the outcome was in fact a rap on the knuckles for those high on ""arrogance of power"".Sena MP Sanjay Raut posted a cartoon that shows a tiger (his party's symbol) wearing a clock locket (NCP's party symbol) sniffing a lotus (BJP's party symbol).Though he indicated that the cartoon was posted in jest, the message was not lost on anyone as Congress leader and former chief minister Ashok Chavan had said earlier that his party should explore all options to keep the BJP out of power. The Congress has an alliance with the Sharad Pawar-led NCP in the state."

INDORE: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Friday said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other opposition leaders need not have any ""misunderstanding"" about the BJP's popularity after poll results in Maharashtra and Haryana, both places where the BJP was in power.The BJP lost its majority in Haryana, though it emerged as the single largest party, while it managed to stay ahead of the pack in Maharashtra but lost a fair number of seats, going down from 122 to 105.Polls in the two states were held on October 21 while results were declared on Thursday.In the Jhabua bypoll in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP lost to the Congress, the latter now having 115 seats in the 230- member state Assembly against the saffron party's 108.The results have buoyed the opposition which was trounced comprehensively in the April-May Lok Sabha polls where the BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned with a bigger mandate than the 2014 edition.Putting up a brave front, Vijayvargiya said, ""The vote share of BJP has risen in Maharashtra and Haryana. If Mamata Banerjee and other opposition leaders have a misunderstanding, (about BJP's popularity), they should clear it and remember that the BJP's popularity has not declined in polls in the two states.""Vijayvargiya is the BJP's general secretary in charge of West Bengal, where his party is in a bitter fight with Banerjee's TMC for pole position, especially after the former won 18 seats in the April-may Lok Sabha polls.Speaking to reporters here, he said, ""We are going to form the government in Haryana as BJP rebels who won as Independent candidates are supporting us.""Taking a swipe at MP CM Kamal Nath, who has been daring BJP to topple his coalition government, Vijayvargiya said the former's ""ego would not last long"" like it was in the case of the mythological ""Ravana"".Nath has no right to comment on recent poll results as he formed his government through manipulation, he alleged."

MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra Assembly election results showed a dip in BJP's tally compared to 2014 polls, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut posted a cartoon to take a dig at his party's senior alliance partner.The cartoon, posted by Raut on his verified Twitter account, shows a tiger (Shiv Senas party symbol) wearing a clock locket (NCPs party symbol) sniffing a lotus (BJPs party symbol).While the post is captioned ""bura na maano Diwali hai"" to denote it was made in jest, the underlying meesage echoes what former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan sought to convey about the Sena, NCP and Congress coming together to prevent BJP from retaining power in Maharashtra.Chavan had on Thursday spoken of an ""interesting possibility"", that of the Sena, NCP and Congress aligning to upset the BJP's applecart.In the 288-member Assembly, the BJP won 105 seats, while ally Sena bagged 56. The NCP bagged 54 seats and the Congress emerged victorious in 44 seats.In the 2014 polls, the BJP had won 122 seats, the Sena 63, the Congress 42 and the NCP 41.Chavan said the results have thrown up an ""interesting possibility"", but stopped short of indicating if the Congress and NCP will align with the Sena - which he termed as the 'lesser evil' (compared to BJP) - to form the next government in Maharashtra.In terms of the increase in number of seats compared to the 2014 polls, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP emerged as the largest gainer, while the BJP's tally took a considerable dip.Meanwhile, the Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday had a big headline on its front page, proclaiming that the Uddhav Thackeray-led party has the ""keys to power"" in Maharashtra."

NEW DELHI: The results of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections should make BJP worry about its prospects in Jharkhand. The ruling party may be forced to tweak its strategy when Jharkhand goes to polls in December.The reason for BJP’s worry may originate from the fact that Jharkhand shares some common political situations with Maharashtra and Haryana which went to polls on October 21.After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the Narendra Modi government came to power, while Maharashtra and Haryana were the first two states to go to polls in October, Jharkhand had faced elections in December the same year.Second, riding on Modi wave, BJP won elections in Jharkhand too.Third, for the first time, Modi and BJP president Amit Shah experimented with social engineering in the three states. In all the three states, BJP installed unconventional chief ministers.Devendra Fadnavis, a Brahmin, took over as the chief minister of Maharashtra which is dominated politically by Marathas. Similarly, Manohar Lal Khattar, a Punjabi, took over the reins of the state where Jats have always dominated the politics.After being carved out as a separate state from Bihar in 2000, tribal-dominated Jharkhand had seen five chief ministers - Babulal Marandi, Arjun Munda, Shibu Soren, Madhu Koda, Hemant Soren. All these five leaders belong to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category.However, after the 2014 Jharkhand assembly election, BJP chose non-tribal Raghubar Das to head the state.Das comes from the OBC category. He is a teli - a caste which was traditionally engaged in the profession of oil-pressing - became the first non-tribal leader to become the chief minister of the state.Thursday’s results in Maharashtra and Jharkhand were below BJP’s expectations. It had hoped to win 75 of the 90 seats in Haryana and 145 of the 288 seats in Maharashtra.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, in order to offset the damage due to caste equations besides economic slowdown, joblessness and agrarian distress in both the states, depended heavily on nationalistic issues in their campaign.The two harped on nullification of Articles 370 and 35A changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir. They talked of the 2016 surgical strikes and air strikes in February in retaliation to Pulwama terror attack. They also discussed banning instant triple talaq.Amit Shah promised to implement National Register of Citizens (NRC) on the national level by 2024.However, caste politics played a major part in checking BJP’s juggernaut.The BJP had to bear the brunt of going against the caste equations in Haryana and Maharashtra - in fact more in Haryana than in Maharashtra.Haryana was sharply divided between Jats and non-Jats. The Jats went against BJP which kept the party from touching the majority mark of 46 seats.On the other hand, a weakened Congress, which was hardly expected to cross even the double digit, became the second largest party by winning 31 seats. The credit goes to the party installing former chief minister Bhupinder Hooda , a Jat, just before the elections.The other Jat-led party - Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) headed by Dushyant Chautala - was the third largest party winning 10 seats.Similarly, going against the tide of caste proved challenging for BJP in Maharashtra.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar , who is considered as the tallest Maratha leader, weaned away the community members.It did not help BJP much even though it went out of its way to woo the Marathas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah invoked Marathas’ tallest and historical icon Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in several of their election rallies in the state.But they could not control the damage completely.As in Haryana and Maharashtra, BJP is likely to face the trouble of the voters getting divided between tribal and non-tribal supporters.The opposition parties, particularly tribal-dominated and former chief minister Shibu Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Congress and Lalu Prasad’s RJD will try their best to wean away the tribal voters from BJP.By the time Jharkhand elections are held in December, nullification of Article 370 and banning instant triple talaq will get older and, therefore, lose their sheen.BJP is likely to change its discourse in Jharkhand to overcome the sentiments against installing a non-tribal as CM, economic slowdown, joblessness and farmers’ distress.Besides tribal identity, joblessness is likely to become a major election issue in Jharkhand which has several industrial towns such as Jamshedpur and Bokaro. Several factories are facing the impact of economic recession and have been forced to either shut down or curtail shifts.Raking up nationalistic issues may have controlled some damage to the BJP governments in Maharashtra and Haryana. But it may not be enough to surmount the challenges in Jharkhand."

NEW DELHI: Congress failed to take advantage of the perception of economic slowdown and local discontent against the ruling BJP-led NDA and, in the process, it lost a golden chance to wrest power from BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana.Congress presented itself as a party which lost steam after the drubbing it got in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even after it had defeated the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh assembly elections last year.As a result, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance got the advantage of the first-past-the-post electoral system in Maharashtra. Further, BJP emerged as the single-largest party in Haryana followed closely by Congress.These are the reasons why Congress missed a golden chance to revive in both Maharashtra and Haryana:Congress is undergoing a major leadership crisis. Rahul Gandhi unceremoniously resigned as the party president after Congress managed to increase its tally in the Lok Sabha elections from 44 in 2014 to 52 this year and he himself lost the family bastion of Amethi.On the one hand he took responsibility for the electoral debacle but on the other hand he also blamed the senior party leaders by stating in his resignation letter that at times he stood completely alone in his fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS and the institutions they have allegedly captured.Senior Congress leaders appealed to Rahul Gandhi not to resign but he stuck to his decision and in the end the party chose his mother and predecessor Sonia Gandhi to lead it as an interim president. This nature of temporariness in the leadership has adversely impacted the morale of the party workers and confidence of the voters.The leaders have expressed their concern for the party. Salman Khurshid recently said the “biggest problem” for Congress was that Rahul Gandhi “walked away” after the Lok Sabha defeat and which “left a vacuum”. Other leaders expressed similar sentiments.Congress proved no match to the BJP carpet-bombing for campaign. Sonia Gandhi did not address a single rally. She was scheduled to address one at Mahendragarh in Haryana on October 18, a day before campaigning came to and end, but it was cancelled at the last moment and Rahul filled the gap.As far as Rahul Gandhi is concerned, his campaigning was too late and too little. He left for Bangkok on October 5 and came back on October 9 to appear before courts in defamation cases against him in Surat and Ahmedabad on October 10 and October 11 respectively.He campaigned for only two days each in Haryana and Maharashtra, addressing two rallies in the former and five in the latter state.As against this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah addressed 14 rallies in Haryana and 28 in Maharashtra.Modi and Shah focused on issues such as nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir, promise of implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the achievements of the two state governments led by Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar But Rahul Gandhi chose to repeat the issues which he had harped on in the Lok Sabha elections and were rejected by the people. He continued with his tirade against the Modi government over matters such as alleged corruption in the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, absconding businessmen such as Ambanis, Adani, Nirav Modi, Vijay Mallya and Mehul Choksi and Nyay (minimum income guarantee) scheme.His attack on the Modi government over economic slowdown, unemployment and farmers’ distress seem to have found some resonance with the voters this time around, particularly in Haryana. However, this wasn’t enough for the party to beat BJP.BJP’s rivals Congress, NCP and the Chautalas are beset with infighting helping the ruling party in both the states. Senior leaders in Maharashtra Sanjay Nirupam and Murli Deora and in Haryana Ashok Tanwar and Bhupinder Singh Hooda were in collision course. While Nirupam withdrew from campaigning, Tanwar quit Congress dealing severe blows to the party.Congress replaced Ashok Tanwar quit late in the day. Had it made the changes even a year ago, the results would have been better for the party.The Sharad Pawar-led NCP in Maharashtra and the Chautalas in Haryana bickered among themselves, which adversely impacted the morale of their parties’ rank and file and handed out advantage to BJP.The opposition parties such as Congress and NCP got weakened as they witnessed large-scale defections to the ruling BJP.The opposition parties had a large gap to cover in relation to BJP and in terms of percentage of vote share.In 2014 Maharashtra assembly election, when BJP and Shiv Sena had contested separately, the former garnered 27.81 per cent of the votes winning 122 of the 288 seats. Shiv Sena on the other hand got 19.3 per cent of the votes and won 63 seats. Together, they got 47.11 per cent of votes and won 185 seats.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got a vote share of 27.59 per cent on 27 of the 48 seats. Shiv Sena garnered 23.29 per cent of the votes polled. Together, their vote share increased to 50.88 per cent.In the 2014 Haryana assembly election, BJP had won 33.2 per cent of the votes polled. This shot up to 58.02 per cent vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Congress failed to cover this gap.In the recently-held Maharashtra assembly election, the vote share of BJP was 25.75 per cent on 164 seats it contested and 16.41 per cent of Shiv Sena on 124 seats it fought, which comes to a total of 42.16 per cent.In contrast to this, the vote share of Congress was 15.87 per cent and that of its ally NCP was 16.71 per cent, totalling 32.58 per cent."

The just concluded assembly election results have surprised many including BJP with some losses in Maharashtra and Haryana. The results were not very encouraging for BJP and allies in Gujarat where they conceded three out of six seats and Bihar where Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) could retain only one out of four seats. The silver lining for BJP has been UP where the ruling party fended off the opposition challenge winning eight out of 11 seats with its ally Apna Dal Though BJP held eight seats which went to polls, it retained all except Zaidpur which went to the Samajwadi Party . This is an improvement from the past where BJP had to face embarrassment when it lost Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha and the Noorpur assembly byelections. The win will provide a much needed boost to Yogi Adityanath ’s leadership within the BJP in the state. Earlier, BJP and allies won 62 out of 80 seats in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi led their election campaign.The results have also been encouraging for Akhilesh Yadav ’s Samajwadi Party. SP bagged three seats, its candidates finished second on four seats while an independent backed by them stood second from Ghosi. Samajwadi Party has emerged as the principal opposition party in the state. It has been disappointing for Mayawati’s BSP which failed to even retain the Jalalpur seat, finishing second on two seats. What should be a worrying sign for BSP is six of their 11 candidates fared worse than Congress candidates. BSP’s vote share also registered a drop of over five percent to 17% in these byelections. Priyanka Gandhi may have something to cheer for as Congress vote share went up to 11.5% from 6.3% in the Lok Sabha elections. Congress candidates from Gangoh and Govindnagar seats finished a creditable second but the party has a long way to before it can compete with SP and BSP as a viable alternative to BJP in 2022."

NEW DELHI: A day after the results of the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra were declared, top Congress leaders on Friday met under the chairmanship of Sonia Gandhi to deliberate upon the poll outcome and evolve a strategy to take on the BJP in the coming times.The 17-member group of leaders, set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, included former prime minister Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi besides other top leaders. The group met at Gandhi's residence.However, AICC general secretary for east Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is not on the key group, sources said.The party will also hold deliberations on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is a key issue in Assam after a large number of its citizens were left out of it.Some of the young leaders who are also part of the key group include Randeep Singh Surjewala, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rajeev Satav and Sushmita Dev.Besides discussing the poll outcome, the panel would discuss key issues which are likely to be taken up in the Winter Session of Parliament starting November 18 and other political issues to take on the Modi government.The issue of joblessness, economic slowdown and distress sale of public sector undertakings would also be taken up and discussed during the meeting.The strategies would be discussed to ""expose the government's failure"" in handling the country's economy, the sources said."

CHANDIGARH: The Congress may be far away from the halfway mark in Haryana , but the party's performance in the state polls has made former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda emerge stronger.After his party lost power in Haryana in the 2014 polls, the 72-year-old satrap had nothing going in his favour. The ruling BJP at the Centre had made alleged irregularities in the land deals during his tenure a major issue and the Congress veteran was grappling with the cases against him.He remained at loggerheads with the party's state unit chief Ashok Tanwar , who quit days after he was replaced by Kumari Selja, weeks ahead of the polls.Hooda, who had virtually threatened to snap ties with the Congress, too was accommodated and made state legislature party leader, weeks before the elections, which some state leaders admit to be a delayed move.""However, both Hooda and Selja aggressively picked up on the issues like unemployment, law and order, agrarian crisis, those relating to economy, employees issues which resonated with the people. Then the party came out with a manifesto, which promised loan waiver to farmers and had something for other sections as well and this helped the party,"" a state unit leader said.""Had the party high command given charge to Hooda and Selja a few months before the polls, Congress's performance would have been even better,"" he said.Notably, Hooda retained his stronghold Garhi Sampla-Kiloi in Rohtak with a comfortable margin. With this win, Hooda now has nine victories under his belt, including one against former deputy prime minister Devi Lal in the Lok Sabha polls.Hooda has been chief minister twice and an MP four times.This time, the BJP fielded against him Satish Nandal, a former Rohtak district unit president of the INLD, who switched sides earlier this year.Hooda had defeated Nandal twice, in 2009 and 2014 from the constituency, and now he inflicted a third shot.Garhi Sampla-Kiloi came into being 10 years ago after a delimitation exercise. Before that the constituency was known as Kiloi.Hooda had won from Kiloi twice, including the 2005 bypoll when he was the Rohtak MP and was handpicked by the high command to be the chief minister of the state.In its sweeping Lok Sabha victory earlier this year, the BJP had breached even the traditional bastions of its opponents. Both Hooda, who fought from Sonipat, and his son Deepender, a three-time MP who contested from Rohtak, lost.However, in the Assembly polls Hooda managed to protect his stronghold as BJP failed to make inroads in the Jat-dominated Deswali belt of Rohtak, Jhajjar and Sonipat districts."

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis was on Thursday set to return as chief minister of Maharashtra , steering the BJP to another electoral win and dealing the NCP-Congress a blow but the victory gong sounded just a little hollow.It was a day of records for the 49-year-old Nagpur-born BJP leader with close family links to the RSS. He is now the first non-Congress chief minister to win a second term in office in the state, seen as a Congress bastion until just five years ago, and only the second chief minister to complete his term in office.Fadnavis, however, has to share the spoils of poll victory with the Shiv Sena As the leads came in, it was victory indeed for India's ruling party but not as decisive as it was hoping for.The BJP, which contested 164 seats, hovered at the 100 mark while the Shiv Sena was ahead in 57, the leads taking the alliance past the magic number needed to come to power in the 288-strong assembly but leaving India's ruling party to deal with its often tetchy partner declaring it would stick to its pre-decided 50-50 power sharing formula.Fadnavis is a law graduate from Nagpur University and holds a postgraduate degree in business management. He was born and raised in Nagpur, home of the headquarters of the RSS. His father Gangadhar Fadnavis was associated with the RSS and hence young Devendra was influenced with the RSS ideology.Fadnavis started his political career in the 1990s.He was an elected member in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation for two consecutive terms - in 1992 and 1997. He was also the youngest mayor of Nagpur, and the second youngest mayor in India.He has represented the Nagpur-South West seat in the state Assembly since 1999.It was perhaps his close equation with the RSS that helped Fadnavis navigate the troubled waters of Maharashtra politics.Fadnavis has had a smooth run, having been given a free hand by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah to lead the saffron fold in the state.With the BJP's victory in the Lok Sabha polls and now in the state elections, Fadnavis has proved his credentials as an astute political leader who has left his political rivals behind in his rise to the top, said party insiders.He inducted senior Congress leaders Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Harshvardhan Patil and a host of top NCP leaders into the BJP, pushing the opposition camp, already down and out after successive defeats in the Lok Sabha polls, into the defensive ahead of the elections. The NCP was poised to win 54 seats and the Congress 45.Political observers describe Fadnavis as a patient listener and a ""man of action"" with extensive knowledge in various spheres. He is also known as a politician who is both erudite and popular with the people.His five-year tenure was marked by several pluses -- the Maratha reservation, the Jalyukt Shivar water conservation scheme, the Nagpur-Mumbai knowledge corridor, farm loan waiver and expansion of the Metro rail network.The Maratha quota agitation threatened the survival of his government, but Fadnavis reached out to the protesters and announced setting up of the State Backward Class Commission to get the demand for reservation in jobs and education ratified and enacted a legislation.Similarly, instead of giving the loan waiver amount to banks, he assured that the the money was transferred directly into the accounts of farmers.Fadnavis also brought bickering ally Shiv Sena to the negotiating table for seat-sharing, demonstrating his deft political management skills.With the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' attacking the government frequently through its editorials, relations between the partners reached a breaking point in the run up to the Mumbai civic polls, which prompted NCP chief Sharad Pawar to predict collapse of the government.""Political reality determines what decisions need to be made. Patience is the key,"" Fadnavis told PTI in an interaction last week.""When you face challenges, they teach you a lot. I learnt political maturity. Whatever agenda you set yourself... every morning throws up a new challenge and problems. While tackling every new challenge, I learnt that I must not give up my focus on what I propose to do,"" he said.Fadnavis has already set his goal in second term of making the state drought free, for which he plans to divert excess rain water from Konkan region to the Godavari valley.He has also proposed to set up a water grid for the perennially parched Marathwada region.He said his goal is to make the state a 'one trillion dollar economy'.In the last five years, Fadnavis has maintained his clean image even as he deftly handled the corruption allegations against some of his ministerial colleagues.His wife Amruta is a banker and a playback singer while daughter Divija is in school. Mother Sarita is a homemaker."

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Thursday sent former finance minister P Chidambaram to custodial interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate till October 30 in the INX Media money laundering case.Special judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar allowed the ED to quiz Chidambaram and said that he be taken to AIIMS immediately in case of any medical complication.The court said that the other conditions of his custody will be the same, including providing him home-cooked food.The probe agency had sought 7-day custodial interrogation of the 74-year old senior Congress leader. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Chidambaram, said the former minister is very ill and sought 2-day interim bail for treatment in Hyderabad.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for ED, opposed the plea and said it would be a serious miscarriage of justice if the agency's investigation is curtailed.Mehta told the court that documentary evidence has come to light which shows Chidambaram's connection to money laundering.The law officer said Chidambaram's pace decreased while answering certain questions during interrogation and more time is needed to quiz him.Mehta told the court that glaring discrepancies between statements of witnesses, co-conspirators and Chidambaram and therefore he needs to be confronted with witnesses and other evidence.Sibal however said there is no basis for further remand and the agency could have easily confronted Chidambaram with the witnesses all these days.The court asked the Solicitor General as to why Chidambaram was not confronted with any witness so far, to which Mehta said the ED wanted to record his statement and there was a time limit.The court said that at this pace even 50 days will be less, but Mehta responded that the agency's pace of investigation was excellent.Sibal told the court that Chidambaram was ill and in acute pain, to which Mehta said he has been examined medically whenever required.Sibal said Chidambaram needs to be treated by his own doctor in Hyderabad.""Let him go and see his doctor and he will cooperate in the investigation after he comes back,"" said Sibal.Mehta told the court that there were enough good doctors in Delhi and he can be treated here."

NEW DELHI: The CBI has filed an FIR against former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat and his then cabinet colleague Harak Singh Rawat, who is now a member of the state's BJP-led government, for alleged attempts of horse trading in 2016, which was caught on tape by an editor of a news channel, officials said on Wednesday.The agency had conducted an preliminary enquiry into the alleged horse trading attempt on March 23, 2016 when the state was under President's rule It sent the tape to the Forensic Science Laboratory, Gandhinagar in Gujarat for analysis which opined that the recording was ""genuine"" and there was no evidence of any ""addition/deletion/insertion/tampering/morphing"" in the video files.The video purportedly showed the Congress leader discussing money to win back the support of disgruntled MLAs who had crossed over to the BJP so that he could get back to power.Recently, the Uttarakhand High Court gave its nod to the CBI to go ahead with its investigation in the case and lodge an FIR against Rawat after the agency submitted a report in a sealed cover on the preliminary inquiry.Besides Harish Rawat and Harak Singh Rawat, who joined the BJP later and is now a minister in the Trivender Singh Rawat-led cabinet, the CBI has also booked editor-in-chief of Noida-based Samachar Plus channel Umesh Sharma, who had purportedly carried out the sting operation in the airport lounge, the officials said.The CBI has slapped Indian Penal Code section pertaining to criminal conspiracy and bribery provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act on the trio.After the video surfaced, the Centre handed over the probe to the CBI.During the preliminary enquiry stage, the CBI had questioned Harish Rawat and Umesh Sharma."

NEW DELHI: The Congress is expected to announce its Madhya Pradesh unit chief soon with chief minister Kamal Nath holding the post at present, sources said.The decision is expected to put an end to perceived jostling for the post among senior leaders.Sources said that party chief Sonia Gandhi has called state in-charge Deepak Babaria for discussions on the issue and a decision is expected in the coming days.The party has seen factionalism over the past few months with a state minister making remarks against senior party leader Digvijaya Singh.Supporters of party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia are keen that he is appointed to the post. However, supporters of chief minister Kamal Nath are pitching for his loyalists for the position.Some of Scindia's supporters in the Gwalior-Chambal region in the past have taken to the streets demanding his appointment as MPCC chief failing which they threatened to sever ties with the party.The jockeying for the post has seemingly delayed the announcement and the central leadership is taking various factors into account.The party can ill-afford factionalism given its dependence on outside support for survival. It has 114 MLAs compared to 108 of the BJP and has outside support of SP, BSP and four independent MLAs.The performance of its government in Madhya Pradesh is crucial for Congress to improve its electoral prospects.The party has much at stake in the Jhabua assembly bypoll whose result will be declared on Thursday.BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has already said that if his party wins bye-election to Jhabua constituency, then the Kamal Nath government would be dislodged.""If the people make us win Jhabua assembly bypoll, then I guarantee to change the Chief Minister of the state,"" he had said on Sunday.The party had come to power last year with Kamal Nath as the state unit chief."

RAIPUR: Farm loan waiver was a one-off thing and won't be repeated next year, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said on Tuesday, triggering protests by the opposition BJP.The loan waver promise for farmers was valid only for once, he said. ""Congress, in its manifesto, had promised to waive farm loans soon after coming to power. The government has already fulfilled it,"" he said. ""Loans of farmers have been waived, as promised by Congress. We had promised loan waiver once, it can't be waived again and again,"" he added.Baghel's statement comes as affirmation of excise minister Kawasi Lakhma's remark on Monday that there will be no ""repeat of waving farmers' loans"" next year.The Baghel government has waived agri loans worth Rs 6,100 crore of nearly 16.65 lakh farmers, say officials."

MUMBAI: The EC's final turnout figure for the state for Monday's polling was 61.13%, which was still less than the 63.2% in this year's Lok Sabha polls and 63.1% in the 2014 state polls. The final Mumbai figure was 50.4%, of which 48.2% was for the island city and 51.2% the suburbs.In Mumbai and across the state, an analysis of the EC's figures shows that turnout has merely dipped in a majority of the 83 seats which were with Congress-NCP. However, the voting pattern shows a big drop - up to 16% - in 10 seats, which may prove to be a swing factor.Of these 10, two constituencies are those from which the Bhujbals are contesting and another is Shirdi, contested by former opposition leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, who crossed over to BJP after the Lok Sabha polls. Nandgaon in north Maharashtra recorded a 51.2% turnout, a steep drop of 16% compared to the 67.7% in 2014. Two-time NCP MLA Pankaj is contesting for the third time from this constituency. In 2014, he had bagged over 69,000 votes while Sena and BJP, which contested separately, managed to get over 50,000 each. Since they are now contesting in alliance, it would be a cause of concern for Bhujbal.Former deputy chief minister Chhagan is contesting from Yewla, which recorded a 7% turnout fall to 63%.Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst, reminded that usually, a shrinking turnout would be a cause for concern for the sitting MLA, irrespective of whether from the ruling party or the opposition. He said anti-incumbency and the candidates' part switch may have led to the dip in turnout.In the city, the turnout at Chandivali, held by Congress' Naseem Khan, has seen a rise to 51.7% from 44.3% in 2014.The vote percentage fell by 11% in Ahmednagar (City) from 59% (in 2014) to 48%. The seat is with NCP's Sangram Jagtap, who had defeated five-time Sena MLA Anil Rathod, buoyed by the vote split between Sena and BJP in 2014. Jagtap won by a mere 3,000 votes, while Sena bagged over 46,000 votes and BJP almost 40,000. Congress stood forth rank with 27,000 votes. The Sena-BJP alliance has again fielded Rathod.The turnout was also down marginally (a shade less than 4%) in Kankavli in Ratnagiri, where incumbent Nitesh Rane has again been fielded, but this time by BJP. Sena has fielded a candidate against him."

MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra ’s voters exercised their franchise to elect the next state government, CM Devendra Fadnavis said he was confident of a two-thirds majority for the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, while the Congress-NCP combine claimed that it was all set to wrest power from the saffron allies. The results will be declared on Thursday.The Election Commission on Tuesday provided the final figures for Monday’s turnout. While the revised turnout for the state went up slightly to 61.1% from the provisional figure of 60.5% given by the EC on Monday evening, that for Mumbai dipped marginally, from 50.5% to 50.4%.Fadnavis on Tuesday kept up thelast week, saying the BJP-Sena would cross the 220 mark.However, state NCP chief Jayant Patil expressed surprise over the claim, saying the people of Maharashtra were set to reject the saffron combine which had “failed on all fronts”. He said, “Fadnavis failed to tackle the agrarian crisis, rural distress and was unable to halt farmers’ suicides. In the recent past, more than 16,000 farmers committed suicide.”While most exit polls have indicated a sweep for the saffron alliance, Patil said he didn’t want to go into the numbers game. But he said he was sure the Congress, NCP and other like-minded parties would form the government. “It’s a fact that TV channels have given a clear majority for the saffron combine, but there are no takers for these surveys,” Patil said.Endorsing Patil’s views, AICC general secretary Avinash Pande said it would not be possible for Fadnavis to retain power. “Fadnavis has missed the opportunity to provide able leadership, and the people of Maharashtra have not voted in the name of PM Modi or the CM. We will come back to power, that too with a huge majority,” Pande claimed."

NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has formed a committee of leaders to deliberate on important issues for enabling the party to come up with reasoned and well thought-out responses to social and political moves of the Narendra Modi government, which hog headlines.Sources said the 21-member “committee on important issues”, which will meet under the chairpersonship of the Congress chief, comprises veterans as well as young faces of the party. It is possible that the group would meet regularly or once a month for brainstorming. Significantly, party members contacted claimed it was an “informal committee”.Among the consequential issues to come up in near future is Ayodhya in which the Supreme Court is set to pronounce its judgment. Also, Uniform Civil Code and subjects like the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) are also in currency.In the face of an onslaught of provocative decisions and announcements of the BJP government, the principal opposition party has appeared clueless, seemingly guided more by kneejerk reactions than a well thrashed out political line.This dissonance was on display during the recent revocation of special status of Jammu & Kashmir through the dilution of Article 370. While the party came out strongly against it, key Congress leaders broke from the official stance and backed the government initiative.When the differences became public, party leaders chafed at an absence of discussion and argued that a nuanced approach, critical of the manner in which Article 370 was diluted without appearing to oppose it in principle, would have been better. Nuancing is the order of the day, with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh speaking along those lines during the Maharashtra election campaign last week in what appeared a course correction.The panel is reminiscent of the “core group” which was put in place during the UPA government in which key members discussed every issue before taking a decision.Importantly, Congress has also formed a dedicated committee on the National Register of Citizens, apparently to steer the party response in coming days. It comprises leaders of north-eastern states.The controversial issue in Assam has seen many twists and turns but may flare up now, with the list of those to be excluded public. While its fervent champion BJP has been rattled by large-scale exclusion of members of the Hindu community, it is now planning the CAB to grant citizenship to Hindu refugees.Congress has been supporting the NRC while arguing that no genuine Indian be left out of it. But it now has to evolve a stance on the controversial issue of proposed “stateless citizens” and about CAB which the north-eastern states are against."

BENGALURU: With exit polls forecasting a facile victory for the BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana and a rout for its rivals, led by the Congress, former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Tuesday expressed suspicion about the credibility of the electronic voting machines Exit polls varied widely in their projection of seats for the rival alliances, but were in no doubt about an emphatic victory with more than two-thirds seats for the BJP-led NDA in both the states.Speaking to reporters at Hubballi, the senior congress leader said he had travelled via road from Solapur to Hyderabad when he had gone to Maharashtra for campaigning and the road condition there was ""pathetic"", despite Nitin Gadkari , who is Union minister for road transport and highways, hailing from the state.There has no been development there in five years, he alleged."" ... dont know how people are voting them. I dont know, Siddaramaiah said.""I dont know why (BJP is winning), they are misusing EVMs-is what I feel...Election Commission of India is under them and functions according to their instructions, like CBI and ED are being misused, he said.Pitching for the ballot paper process, he claimed several developed countries have gone back to this system.When people have expressed suspicion, why you (BJP) want EVM? EC has to take a decision when all parties have expressed doubts, he said.""Results will be out on October 24, we will have to accept public mandate, what kind of verdict they will give I dont know,"" he added.Alleging that BJP was misusing the Election Commission, Siddaramaiah pointed out that the EC announced calendar of events for bypolls in Karnataka from December 5, but code of conduct was not put into effect immediately.What do you call it? What inference one could draw? Election Commission is functioning as per the directions of the central government, he said.Bypolls to 15 of 17 seats represented by disqualified MLAs, whose resignation and absence from the trust vote led to the fall of the Congress-JD(S) coalition government, will be held on December 5, and code of conduct will come into force from November 11.The then Speaker had disqualified them as MLAs, which they have challenged in the Supreme Court and the matter is likely to come up before the court on Wednesday.Siddaramaiah also hit out at the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government in the state and accused it of failing to provide proper relief to those hit by recent floods in the state."

A BJP neta said “loyal voters” stood by the saffron alliance

MUMBAI: Regardless of the low turnout of voters on Monday, the Marathis and Gujaratis together have emerged as the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance’s most durable votebank in the city, according to preliminary reports compiled by saffron candidates.In fact, both the BJP and Sena seemed least perturbed by the poor turnout. “Our loyal voters -- the Marathis, Gujaratis and the north Indians -- have stood by us,” said a senior city BJP leader on Monday. While support from Marathi voters to the Sena in constituencies where it had put up its candidates was near-total, they backed the BJP in equal measure, he added. Setting aside community loyalty, the mercantile community also backed Sena candidates in Marathi-dominated constituencies such as Mumbadevi, Worli, Mahim, Sewri and Byculla because of the BJP agenda: revoking of Article 370, Uniform Civil Code and the surgical strikes on Pakistan, said a Sena functionary.Sena president Uddhav Thackeray won over the mercantile community by repeatedly referring to the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, echoing the views of Hindutva supporters.Also, Aaditya Thackeray is seen by Mumbai’s traders as a young Sena leader who is willing to make a clean break from his party’s rough and ready style of politics, while the north Indians too are willing to shed their inhibitions about the Sena, he added.Ex-Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said north Indians and Gujaratis-Marwaris have become, post-2014, the BJP’s “silent majority.” “Once the three communities were the Mumbai Congress’s bulwark,” he pointed out.In Sena constituencies, senior Sena leaders made it a point to build bridges with Gujarati-Marwari voters, canvassing support for the Marathi candidate, sources said. The BJP too practised the technique with finesse.“The Gujaratis in my constituency have always backed the BJP, irrespective of the candidate’s community. Also, the BJP’s Marathi candidates bond pretty well with the traders’ community,” said Parag Alavani, the BJP MLA from Vile Parle who is contesting against Jayanti Siroya, a Gujarati from the Congress party.However, Gujarati traders were in a fix in constituencies where both principal protagonists were Marathis. For instance, Sada Sarvankar, the sitting Sena MLA, locked horns with MNS’ Sandeep Deshpande in Mahim. In Magathane, Sena MLA Prakash Surve took on MNS’ Nayan Kadam, while BJP MLA Manisha Chaudhary faced two Marathi candidates --Arun Sawant of the Congress and Rajesh Yerunkar (MNS) -- in Dahisar. “Under such circumstances the Gujarati-Marwari voters may have refrained from going to the voting station,” said a BJP worker from Dahisar, adding, “But the final picture of constituency-wise voting patterns will emerge in a day or two.” Mumbadevi came as an interesting example of the Gujarati-Marathi bond cemented by Modi’s appeal and local calculations, said observers.Of 11 candidates in the fray in this populous hub of small traders, eight were Muslims, while Keshav Mulay (MNS), Pandurang Sakpal (Sena) and Udaykumar Shiroorkar (Independent) were Marathis. “It is a foregone conclusion that Gujarati-Marwaris backed Sena’s Sakpal,” said Satish Khamkar, a Sena sympathiser."

The 2014 state assembly polls which propelled BJP to power had witnessed a record turnout of 76.54%. RSS pracharak-turned-politician Manohar Lal Khattar, who was a surprise choice for the chief minister’s post in 2014, is the BJP’s CM face for the elections this time. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the turnout was 70.36%.In Haryana , such low turnout for assembly polls was witnessed in 1991 when 65.86% was recorded. The current turnout is lowest as compared to 71.96% in 2005, 72.37% in 2009 and 76.54% in 2014.Prominent among politicians whose electoral fate would be decided on October 24 are Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala.All eyes are also on Baroda, Dadri and Pehowa, from where the ruling BJP fielded three Olympians — Yogeshwar Dutt, Babita Phogat and Sandeep Singh. It is for the first time that the sportspersons of such high stature were fielded by any political party in Haryana.The focus will also remain on Narnaund, Tohana, Badli and Mahendergarh where senior BJP leaders Captain Abhimanyu, Subhash Barala, Om Prakash Dhankar and Ram Bilas Sharma, respectively are struggling to retain their seats. The results of state’s hottest seat, Uchana Kalan where former Union minister Birender Singh’s wife Prem Lata Singh is in a tough contest against Dushyant, are also most awaited.There was trouble in Uchana on Monday afternoon when Dushyant accused BJP supporters of booth capturing. He alleged that an attempt was made to attack him and he was pushed around by BJP supporters. The situation was immediately brought under control after Jind DC Aditya Dahiya and SP Ashwin Shenvi intervened. The JJP also filed a complaint in this regard.Some minor incidents between supporters of different political parties were reported at Dabwali in Sirsa and Narnaund in Hisar but were resolved with intervention of local administration.Two villages — Paintawas Khurd under Dadri assembly seat and Datoli under Badhra constituency of Charkhi-Dadri district — boycotted the polling because of water scarcity. Even district administration officials failed to convince them to cast their votes and villagers observed a complete boycott of the elections. Both the villages had also boycotted polling in the Lok Sabha elections held in May this year.Heavy voter turnout was witnessed in many constituencies such as Fatehabad, Kalayat, Sadhaura (SC), Narnaund, Naraingarh, Tohana, Kaithal, Jagadhari, Barwala and Hathin.According to Haryana chief electoral officer Anurag Aggarwal, the turnout in the state assembly polls has been provisionally recorded at around 65%. He said that the figure was tentative and is likely to increase slightly."

MUMBAI: Colaba recorded the lowest turnout at 40.2% among all 288 constituencies in the state. At 47.2%, the other south Mumbai locality of Malabar Hill, too, saw a much lower voter turnout than in the recent Lok Sabha election.Officials blaned voter apathy for the poor numbers. District election officer Shivaji Jondhale said the recent general elections had seen 50% and 56% voting in Colaba and Malabar Hill, respectively, which fell by roughly 10% in the assembly polls. He said the areas are dominated by top corporate executives and businessmen for whom state-level issues matter little. “Income tax, corporate tax and central policies are closer to their hearts,” he said.In the 2014 assembly election, Colaba had registered 46.1% and Malabar Hill 52.5% voter turnout —5-6% more than in the current polls. At the two Kendriya Vidyalaya polling stations in Colaba, voter turnout ranged from 0.1% to to 2%. A election official said barely 14 of the 1,000 voters turned up at one of the Kendriya Vidyalaya schools. At an Army Public School booth near R C Church, out of 233 voters only eight cast their vote or just 3.5%.The municipal school inside Colaba market registered 35% voting by 5.30pm.Kemps Corner, Pedder Road, Walkeshwar, Banganga, Colaba market and Navy Nagar registered an average of 30% voting by 3pm and the polling booths wore a deserted look post noon.At Activity Infant School off Pedder Road, where prominent voters such as chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and HDFC chairman Dilip Parekh voted, the overall percentage touched 35% by 4.30pm.At 3pm, the Walkeshwar Banganga Municipal school saw just 32% voting. A few people, mainly the youth, complained their names were not registered despite submitting applications twice. BJP corporator Jyotsna Mehta was unhappy with the initial response of voters and was seen working hard to ensure maximum voting. At Villa Theresa High School near Kemps Corner, election officers complained youth were not turning up in sizable numbers. Lack of parking saw many leave without voting."

MUMBAI: Many depositors of PMC Bank expressed their anger by either boycotting Monday’s elections or exercising their franchise but opting for NOTA (None of the Above) at polling booths. A section of medical students, and aspirants along with parents, also chose NOTA to protest the introduction of the Maratha quota this year.In Mulund colony, 70-yearold Lalchand Nanwani was fuming as he decided not to leave his residence along with his senior citizen wife to vote. “These politicians did not bother to visit our homes and enquire about our wellbeing. The Rs 40,000 withdrawal was pittance as we have huge medical costs,” he said. The colony has nearly 20,000 depositors. Scores of Sindhis and Sikh residents here were angry with the “government apathy” in the aftermath of the bank’s closure. A few went to the booths and voted NOTA, said Raju R Tejwani from the colony.Roads in the area which would be lively during past elections with citizens making a beeline for their booths were deserted on Monday. Attendance at nearby booths was below normal in the morning and early afternoon hours. “When there is any auto or bus fare hike, there is dharna by political parties on the roads. What about our bank crisis? Why didn’t any party come forward with a dharna here?” asked a peeved Jayant Khatri. “We should be compensated from the PM or CM relief fund. Our families are in deep crisis,” added Chandru Bulchandani.Among those who abstained from voting were families who lost relatives in the aftermath of the crisis and felt hopeless. The family of Andheri resident Sanjay Gulati, who died of heart attack, stayed away. Gulati’s widow Bindu said: “Not a single PMC, RBI or government officer has approached us since I lost my husband. I have to manage my autistic child’s school fees, household expenses, I have elderly in-laws to care for. With all my money held up in PMC Bank, what hope do I have left? Why should I vote amid my grief and my troubles?” In Mulund Colony, Prem Dharra, who lost his father Murlidhar, was undecided about voting. “No authority has approached us to ask after our welfare either,” he said.Oshiwara resident Shachi Pestonji said: “There seems to be a general consensus to not vote or go for NOTA, since most depositors are disappointed with the government response to the PMC problem.” However, several others thought otherwise. Arati Salgaonkar, who is a member of six PMC WhatsApp groups, said there had been a sentiment for NOTA at first. “However, individually we felt it is best to choose a candidate who has done work,” she said.PMC Bank staffers whose salary accounts are in the bank did go out to vote."

NEW DELHI: BJP seems headed back to office with strong majorities in Maharashtra and Haryana , seemingly riding on effective state leadership and the overhang of this year’s Lok Sabha results, embellished by the Modi government’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. If the polls prove correct, it will be the first time BJP will retain office in both states.According to exit polls on Monday evening after voting ended, the BJP-Shiv Sena combine looks set to retain office in Maharashtra with numbers ranging from 166 to 244, sufficient to cross the 145-seat majority mark. The poll of polls gave it almost a three-fourths majority.Several exit polls showed BJP close to a majority on its own, while Sena may also see a surge in numbers. The decision to field Sena scion Aditya Thackeray may have enthused the party base.Interestingly, the exit polls suggest NCP may get more seats than Congress. The Congress-NCP alliance seems to be holding some ground in western Maharashtra, its bastion, but here, too, the saffron parties may improve.The influx of influential Maratha politicians into BJP and Sena may have boosted the alliance.In Video: Maharashtra, Haryana Assembly Elections: Exit polls indicate BJP victory"

MUMBAI: Nationalist Congress party chief Sharad Pawar expressed confidence here on Monday that there will be a change of guard in Maharashtra after the assembly elections.Voting for the 288 assembly seats in the state began at 7am on Monday. The BJP-Shiv Sena combine, which ousted the Congress and NCP from power in 2014, is seeking a second term this time.Pawar, his grand-daughter Revati Sule and son-in-law Sadanand Sule voted at a polling booth in south Mumbai in the morning.""Youngsters want change. The BJP and Shiv Sena ruled the state and people hoped their expectations would be fulfilled. That trust, however, has been betrayed,"" Pawar told reporters afterwards.Maharashtra lagged behind in sectors such as agriculture and industries, and there were job losses too, the former Union minister claimed.""All this has created restlessness among people ... I got good response across the state (during the campaigning). I do not have any doubt that there will be a change,"" he said.Election results will be out on October 24."

MUMBAI: Voting is under way in all 288 assembly constituencies of Maharashtra where 3,237 candidates, including 235 women, are in the fray. The BJP, under CM Devendra Fadnavis's leadership, is seeking a second straight term in the state.The BJP has fielded its nominees in 164 assembly seats, including candidates of smaller allies contesting on its lotus symbol, while Shiv Sena is contesting 124 seats. On the other hand, the opposition Congress has fielded 147 candidates and its ally NCP 121.Here are six factors that may determine the outcome in these elections:The BJP-Sena regime’s decision to appease Maharashtra’s most dominant community with a 12% quota in educational institutions and government jobs is expected to have an impact on the outcome of the polls. The reservation, which is in addition to the newly introduced one for the economically weaker section (EWS), enabled BJP to make inroads beyond OBC and Brahmin constituencies into Maratha country. By plugging for it, Devendra Fadnavis—only the second Brahmin CM ever in the state— managed to earn the street cred he needed to come across as a mass leader.The BJP has trumpeted its decision to nullify the special status enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir at every poll rally. But the Opposition has called the display of nationalism in a state poll a diversion. In any case, local issues such as drought relief or job loss have received less air time than government’s “brave” decision to bring J&K closer to the union. But will burnishing nationalist credentials strengthen the prospects of BJP’s state unit? The verdict is still out.The issue has a resonance that cuts across class and social divides. By projecting a tough-on-corruption stand, BJP has gained an upper hand. With a narrative focused on the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scam and irrigation contracts of the past, NCP leaders have been pushed to explain their role in previous regimes. However, the probe has barely progressed despite prodding by courts. But the cases make headlines and opposition leaders have no recourse, except to paint themselves as victims of a vindictive establishment.Maharashtra still records the most farmer suicides, more than 12,000 in the four years from 2015-1019. Drought and floods have left agriculturists in Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra wringing their hands. Fadnavis regime’s loan waiver benefited roughly 44 lakh of the 89 lakh farmers eligible. Rest are chafing at the delay in writing off their debts, which prevents them from raising fresh bank funds. While the state government claims agriculture output in 2018-19 has been better than in most drought years, production has fallen. Unable to realise better remuneration and dependent on support pricing, rural sector still awaits reforms that are needed to make farming profitable. But will this impact on the election? That’s a tough ask, given that many of the problems are legacy issues.From the Prime Minister Samman Nidhi pension of Rs 6,000/year to insurance payouts for crop failure, from rural housing grants to toilets and farm ponds, each of these welfare schemes has high penetration and are expected to cushion the impact of anti-incumbency. Cumulatively, they are seen as signs of a government that works, even if it falls short of expectations.The CM managed to steer a stable though sporadically unruly coalition through his term, providing continuity in decision-making and keeping broad parameters under control. His main focus was infrastructure development, which paved the way for big-ticket projects like Mumbai-Nagpur superhighway and Metro rail expansion in urban centres. With deadlines and targets, he kept the bureaucracy on its toes. Critics have, however, slammed his handling of the agriculture sector, questioned the poor outcomes in education, and pointed to government’s inability to generate jobs despite a large industrial base.In Video: Maharashtra Assembly elections: Voting for 288 seats"

CHANDIGARH: All senior leaders, including chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar , former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala, spent time in their constituencies and residences on the eve of polling for the state assembly elections.After holding a roadshow on Saturday in Karnal, CM Khattar reached Chandigarh on Sunday morning. He spent his whole day speaking to the party workers over phone to take the feedback. He held various round of meetings with the personal staff deployed at CM residence in Chandigarh.“He was quite relaxed and would travel to Karnal by train to cast his vote on Monday,” one official at the CM’s residence said.Hooda also remained busy at his Model Town residence in Rohtak and his native village Sanghi. At Rohtak, he met visitors, taking feedback and giving last-minute instructions to party workers. His son and former MP Deepender Hooda had been visiting various places to join villagers over tea.Barala spent first half of the day with the party workers and booth managers. Later, he too got in touch with rest of the party leaders across the state.“We had couple of meetings in the city and some villages. But, largely I spent day at office and then back at home. Some coordination work was to be done. But, mainly we asked our workers to ensure maximum polling and be there on the booths well in time,” said Barala.“We are hopeful of peaceful and transparent polling on Monday,” he added.Meanwhile, a high drama prevailed at AAP main office in Rohtak when officials from district election office reached there while party Haryana head Navin Jaihind was addressing a press conference in violation of the model code of conduct.Jaihind had called the conference over the video of Assandh BJP candidate Bakshish Singh, claiming to have tampered with EVMS, doing round on social media.Olympic medallist wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who is contesting as BJP candidate from Baroda assembly constituency of Sonipat, spent the day with the villagers. “He went around meeting and greeting people on the basis of input given by the organisation’s team. At the same time, he has been interacting with workers regarding booth management as well,” a member of Dutt’s media team said."

PUNE: A good education system, jobs, better infrastructure and a corruption-free system are issues that young electors, many of them voting for the first time, may have in mind as they go to vote on Monday.“These elections are for the state and closer to our locality. Though we did not see much campaigning for these elections we are hoping that the elected leaders can give a hearing to the demands of the youth,’’said Parth Nathwani, a young voter The rain may not dampen a young voter who had planned a Diwali trip with her friends. She said she would vote before heading out on Monday but is hoping that leaders help translate the present education system into jobs.“All government institutes should be able to get companies for placements and the elected leaders should be able to address infrastructural issues,’’she said, adding that the present infrastructure in Pune was terrible . Another 19-year-old engineering student felt women’s safety is why she would vote and is hoping that the elected leaders address women’s issues.Election officials said there have been several drives and social media messages urging people to vote. Activist Indira Malkani, working in the field of motivating voters, said there was less time for election campaigns, not much visibility of candidates and rain was making it difficult. “However, we hope both young and old come out to vote in large numbers,’’she said.The reasons for eligible electors, especially those in the 18-28 age band, choosing not to vote need to be explored. “This is not unusual. Many political leaders are not able to strike a chord with the youth and their issues,’’ a political watcher said.“There is always talk about increasing the voter turnout. Instead, the best way is to increase the ease of voting. The country needs to think about apps to cast votes,” a 20-year-old said."

BENGALURU: As many as 27 JD(S) legislators, including 11 council members, have put the party on notice, unmasking their deep differences with the party’s first family.Sources said the strained ties between the legislators and the party’s top leadership — former PM HD Deve Gowda, former CM HD Kumaraswamy and former minister HD Revanna — are beyond repair. After unhappy legislators met about a week ago, Deve Gowda reportedly tried to broker peace but none expressed desire to show up at that meeting.The development comes ahead of the December 5 Karnataka byelections. Sources said the disgruntled legislators are likely to hold a meeting in Mangaluru in the first week of November to discuss the next step. A senior party legislator said, “When it was in power in alliance with Congress, JD(S) didn’t take seniors or other leaders seriously even in matters like allocating funds for our constituencies. Should we stand with them when they do not want us?”"

MUMBAI: The ruling BJP-Shiv Sena appears to have an edge over a badly mauled opposition, but rebellion could affect the saffron alliance’s chances in nearly 40 constituencies in the state assembly elections , said political analysts. In all, 8.97 crore voters will choose from 3,237 candidates in 288 constituencies across the state on Monday.“While BJP has humbled the Congress-NCP by encouraging large-scale defections, it faces stiff opposition from the Sena, and the Sena from BJP rebels in many constituencies. This is a strange situation. Nature doesn’t like a vacuum, even in politics,” said a former bureaucrat.The ruling alliance will be worried about whether agrarian distress, the state administration’s handling of the recent floods in parts of the state or the fallout of the PMC Bank scam and the overall economic slowdown may bring down its numbers. Its other worry is a low turnout—due to voter fatigue following the April-May Lok Sabha polls and the apparent lack of a serious contest in the assembly poll—in Mumbai, Pune and other cities, which it is confident of sweeping and where its talk on revoking Article 370 is intended to have maximum effect.The Congress-NCP too would be dreading depleted voting numbers: In parts of western Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, where it is anxious to make a comeback, fewer voters coming out may mean ‘Advantage Incumbent’.PM Modi brought up the point at his rally at BKC when he said, “Don’t go to Gujarat, Goa or don’t think of going to Pune to meet your relatives. On Monday, queue up before the nearest polling booth and cast your vote.”Shorn of poll rhetoric, this campaign was chiefly centred around CM Devendra Fadnavis and Sharad Pawar. This reflects the big changes in state politics, said a chronicler. “While Fadnavis offers to voters a heady brew of technology and patriotism, Pawar represents the Nehruvian era steeped in consensual politics and collective leadership.”Fadnavis and Pawar campaigned vigorously across the state, in contrast with the Congress’s lacklustre campaign, which the NCP fears may hurt the opposition combine’s attempts to fight back.Intra-party revolt has come as a jolt to all parties, especially the BJP-Sena alliance because it is in power. The BJP in Mumbai denied nomination to three seniors: ministers Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta and former minister Raj Purohit. Mehta’s supporters went on a rampage in Ghatkopar, demanding ticket to their leader. Two days later, Mehta fell in line. However, despite attempts by Matoshree, Rajul Patel, the Sena rebel, continues to lock horns with Bharati Lavekar, the official ‘yuti’ candidate in Versova. Similarly, Trupti Sawant, Sena’s sitting MLA, is contesting against Mumbai Vishwanath Mahadeshwar, Sena’s official nominee in Bandra (East).In all, rebels from the saffron camp are taking on the alliance’s official candidates in 37 constituencies across the state. This may raise opposition hopes or even result in more Independents getting elected, said analysts.In Pune, a Sena rebel is crossing swords with Mukta Tilak, Pune mayor and BJP candidate in Kasba, a BJP bastion. In the Kothrud pocketborough of Pune, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil faces rough weather because of internecine squabbling and because Congress-NCP and other opposition parties have backed Kishore Shinde, the MNS candidate.The Congress-NCP combine is, in western Maharashtra, hoping to profit from its yet robust networking in the cooperative sector.Having bagged 44 of 62 seats in Vidarbha in the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP, this time around, faces a challenge from rebels here. Also, the Sena, which was keen on deepening its roots in the region, is not happy with its measly share of 12 seats. In Ramtek, Yeotmal, Umarkhed, Hinganghat, Bhandara and Washim constituencies, BJP candidates are being opposed by Sena rebels, while in Gondia, Buldhana, Daryapur, Arni and Tumsur, BJP faces intra-party revolt.The BJP-Sena are working at odds in nine of the 35 constituencies in northern Maharashtra, it is learned, while in 2 (Sakri and Shirpur), BJP is wracked by internal dissension. In Yeola in Nashik, former deputy CM Chhagan Bhujbal is locked in a fierce poll combat with Sena’s Sambhaji Pawar.The BJP projected Fadnavis as its poster boy praised by both Modi and BJP president Amit Shah. Both said Fadnavis was set to get a second term as CM.The election will determine the political future of bigwigs, including Fadnavis, ex-CMs Prithviraj Chavan and Ashok Chavan (both Congress), state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, NCP heavyweights Chhagan Bhujbal, Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil, and senior ministers, including Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar (all BJP), Eknath Shinde (Sena) and Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, the former state Congress president who migrated to BJP and won a ministership in the Fadnavis regime, triggering more defections from Congress to BJP.Marathwada may go the BJP-Sena way as Congress-NCP failed to take on the ruling alliance on issues such as drought and water scarcity, it is said.Former Congress CM Ashok Chavan is said to be in a strong position in Nanded, while Amit Deshmukh and his brother Dhiraj of Congress seem set to retain Latur, the family bastion nurtured by their father, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh. In Beed, it’s a Munde-versus-Munde fight with BJP minister Pankaja Munde contesting against cousin, Dhananjay, an NCP leader.In coastal Konkan, the big fight is between Nitesh Rane (BJP) and Sena’s Satish Sawant in Kankavli. The Sena is miffed with Fadnavis for opening BJP’s doors for ex-CM Narayan Rane, Nitesh’s father. The Sena considers the Ranes its principal political rivals in Konkan. In Raigad district, a BJP rebel has filed nomination papers against Manohar Bhoir, the Sena nominee.The BJP is contesting 164 of the total 288 seats, while the Sena's tally is 124, the party's lowest in the saffron alliance’s 25 years of poll partnership, a clear indication that Sena has been reduced to a junior partner in the ‘yuti’ and that Matoshree’s plan to form a government on its own remains a distant dream.The BJP seems inching closer to the late Pramod Mahajan's gameplan of ‘shat pratishat BJP’, 100% growth of the party in Maharashtra.Uddhav Thackeray agreed to play second fiddle to BJP in order to retain Sena’s share in power in absence of which he fears a split in the party. At the Dussehra conclave in Mumbai this month, he made it clear to his followers he preferred power to rough and ready politics of the past."

NEW DELHI: Congress is mulling an organisational reshuffle in the coming months, a plan that has triggered strong buzz among insiders about its sweep with many wondering if it could be a generational makeover.If it happens, it would be the first rejig of office-bearers in the central party unit under the watch of Sonia Gandhi who recently returned to the Congress helm as ‘interim president’, two years after she passed the baton to son Rahul Gandhi Well-placed party sources said a reshuffle was under discussion and a decision would be taken soon. “It can be big and it may not be so big. Nothing is final yet,” a senior party leader said as a caveat against any drastic conclusion.With the talk of rejig reaching Congress leaders, speculation is rife about its scale. As it is being planned in the wake of the second successive Lok Sabha election disaster and after Rahul resigned as party chief owning “moral responsibility”, many wonder if it would be a largescale makeover.Indications of organisational overhaul are invariably seen in terms of generational change, with ‘GenNext vs Old Guard’ being the running theme since Rahul’s advent. It is to be seen if it becomes another jab at infusing young blood in the AICC and in state units.With Sonia forced by the party to take over as interim president after Rahul refused to take back his resignation which he announced two days after the Lok Sabha mauling, the question looms about when a full-time president would return to steer Congress.It is reliably learnt that the AICC has been looking at an earlier decision of the Congress Working Committee to reduce the term of the organisation, which includes the party chief, from five years to three years. While the 2018 decision was never ratified, it has remained in the books.The dormant decision would suggest that party elections be held in 2020.Though it is believed that Sonia would remain at the helm till the assembly elections next year, which include Delhi, a full-time president would then have to be put in place. There are indications that Rahul would return as Congress president. The Gandhi scion has not yet spoken on the issue of his again taking the leadership but influential insiders and party leaders have begun to raise the demand in public.“There is pressure from our workers that Rahul Gandhi should come back. There is unanimity on this,” a senior leader said."

CHENNAI: Only less than one-fourth of the 99,807 registered overseas voters (ROVs) had exercised their franchise in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Kerala overwhelmingly led the list, with 25,534 ROVs casting their votes out of the total 25,606, who actually turned up to vote across India.The low turnout of ROVs is due to the fact that they have to come to their respective constituencies to cast their votes on the day of polling. Even in the case of Kerala, only 30% of its total ROVs had turned up to vote.MA Yusuff Ali, one of the world’s richest Malayalis and managing director of Lulu Group International, took time off to cast his vote in his native Nattika in Kerala. Ali, who had migrated from his native village in the early 70s to Abu Dhabi, flew in on the polling day and stood in the queue to cast his vote.Some of the ROVs had combined their holiday trips to their native places with the poll timeframe to get a chance to cast their votes. In several other states, not a single overseas voter had exercised his/her franchise.In Punjab, 33 ROVs exercised their franchise out of 1,523. Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Goa, Chandigarh are a few other states and Union Territories, where some of the ROVs had exercised their franchise.While overseas Indians are free to vote in their constituencies, where their names are registered, a bill is pending in Parliament to allow them the option of proxy voting."

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Sunday sought to know why top BJP leaders held so many rallies for the Maharashtra assembly polls, when chief minister Devendra Fadnavis feels there is no opposition left in the fray to challenge his party-led alliance.In a column in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', party's Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut also claimed that the poll plunge of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's son Aaditya Thackeray will change the state's ""political dynamics"" in coming years.Hinting at the waning strength of the opposition parties, Fadnavis recently said there was no ""wrestler"" left in the fray who can challenge the BJP-led alliance.""The chief minister has been asserting that the opposition 'does not exist' any more in the poll campaign. The question then arises about the motive behind some 10 rallies of (Prime Minister) Modi, 30 of (Union home minister) Amit Shah , and Fadnavis himself holding 100 rallies across Maharashtra,"" Raut said.The same question is being raised by NCP chief Sharad Pawar as well, which is not wrong, he said.""Though Fadnavis said he is not facing any opposition challenge, in reality there is electoral challenge, which forced the BJP leaders to hold so many rallies,"" Raut, the Marathi daily's executive editor, claimed in his column 'RokhThok'.He further said that Aaditya Thackeray's foray into elections was going to change the ""political dynamics"" of the state in coming years.""He is contesting elections not to just sit in the assembly, but the new generation wants him to lead the state,"" he claimed.Aaditya Thackeray, the first member from his family to enter the electoral battle, is contesting the polls from Mumbai's Worli assembly constituency.Raut also said that his party is in the electoral fray to keep intact the state's ""geographical boundaries"".During the recent election campaign, Fadnavis said the demand for Vidarbha state is the ""BJP's principled stand"".The chief minister said his party feels there should be smaller states, but when to take decision on this is upto the central leadership.The Sena has been opposing separate statehood for Vidarbha region.Raut said issues like the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and demand for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya were for the first time raised during Maharashtra polls campaign, a move opposed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar.The Sena, however, spoke about issues of the common man, he pointed out.""The Shiv Sena has promised a full meal at Rs 10 for the common man and medical check-up at Re one. There should have been someone in the campaign to speak on issues of the state and the common man. What Fadnavis has done for the state in last five years is going to be tested tomorrow,"" he said.Raut also claimed that the run up to Monday's state polls saw the highest number of political defections.""There are rebels in at least 37 Assembly segments. Both the parties (BJP and Sena) had earlier prepared for contesting separately, hence many aspirants were disappointed and some of them decided to contest separately,"" he said.""They are doing it to stay relevant in their constituencies, so I will not call them rebels,"" he added.Polling for all 288 assembly seats in the state will be held on Monday and counting of votes will take place on October 24."

ELLENABAD/REWARI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrapped up his party's campaign in Haryana, which will go to polls on October 21, with two rallies where his focus remained on Kashmir.Modi urged the crowd to punish Congress by not voting for it since it questioned the move by his government to abrogate Article 370 , which gave Kashmir special status . Terming the Congress stand '(an insult to Ahirwal/as the region is known)', Modi said the best punishment would be to remove Congress from the political landscape itself.Modi repeatedly asked the crowd to remember what happened on August 5 this year (when the Centre announced its Kashmir decision ).""In 1964, Congress gave a false assurance right in Parliament that Article 370 is temporary and will be repealed within a year. It failed to do that all these years, and now when we finally abrogated it, it (Congress) is seething. (It is) asking what Modi thinks of himself. And it has the audacity to come and seek your votes.

NEW DELHI: The BJP aggressively used revoking of Article 370 by the Modi government as a majorof Maharashtra and Haryana, evoking a strong retort from the opposition, with the Congress saying the ruling party was using the issue to mislead people.PM Modi openly challenged the Congress with restoring the scrapped law if it came to power and blamed the party for not ensuring proper integration of Kashmir. He said the provision had been used by the adversary to cause trouble.""During a debate in Parliament in 1964, the country's distinguished leader got upset… there was division in the Congress. There was a demand that Article 370 be nullified and there be a debate on this issue in Parliament,"" he said.""At that time, Congress leaders, with folded hands, had said that their demand would be met and Article 370 would be nullified in one year. But the matter was again put on the back burner,"" said Modi while addressing his second rally of the day.""What was the compulsion and what game was being played,"" he asked, urging people to punish the Congress for it in the assembly polls.Home minister Amit Shah said that it took ato do what Congress didn't.""No PM ever dared to take the decision. It was Modi with his 56-inch chest who made the move,"" he said.""Rahul Gandhi asks what is the connection between Article 370 and Maharashtra. I dare him to declare that if voted to power, his party would restore the provisions of Article 370,"" Shah said.However the Congress was dismissive of the BJP's charge, with party spokesperson Anand Sharma saying the Congress never tried tofrom the wars it fought.Attacking the BJP government over unemployment and economic slowdown, Sharma said ""There are no sings of financial growth and employment generation in the BJP governments. They are using (scrapping of) Article 370 to divert the attention of people form main topics.""Speaking on similar lines, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said, ""Whether they go to Maharashtra or Haryana, they rake up nationalism because they have nothing to say on the performance of their governments.""About the Modi government's decision to scrap Article 370, Gehlot said, ""The way they took this decision, it created a controversy not just in the country, but in the world.""J&K Congress spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said the Centre will not be able to delay for long the restoration of full statehood to the state. He said the BJP has failed to justify the decision to downgrade Jammu and Kashmir's status to Union Territory.(With agency inputs)"

PHAGWARA: Even as he claimed that the Congress would win the bypolls at all four assembly seats, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday insisted that results could not be considered a referendum on the performance of his government.“We are winning the all the four seats. Jalalabad is being projected as Sukhbir Singh Badal ’s stronghold but we are set to win that seat too,” said Amarinder during his roadshow in Phagwara in support of party candidate Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal.However, when asked if the results of these bypolls should be considered referendum on the performance his government as his party was making it a main issue during campaigning and opposition was raising questions on this, he said, “These can’t be termed referendum as we have our manifesto and still there are two-and-a-half years remaining to implement it fully. It will be after the completion of the five year term that there will be referendum on the performance as work is still on.” CM was interacting with mediapersons aboard his special bus.‘Convicted cops being released on health grounds’Responding to queries about decision to grant pardon to release five police officials convicted in fake encounters when they had served very shorty terms in jails, CM said that they were being released on health ground only. Asked if they would apply these parameters to all types of convicts, he said “We are applying to everyone”. Responding to another query about pardon to cops while earlier he had been taken a clear stand against fake encounters (when he was in opposition), he brought in the issue of Sikh prisoners lodged in jails for close to 25 years who were now being released and said matter had to come to an end. “For sorting issues, people have to sit at the table at the end. They (cops) are being released on health grounds,” he added. Responding to another query, he said former DGP Sumedh Saini would have to answer for the wrongs he committed and if he had violated any process of law he should be held liable for it."

CHANDIGARH: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addressed his second rally in Haryana’s Ahirwal region — seen as a BJP citadel — at Mahendergarh fort on Friday, filling in for his mother and party’s working president Sonia Gandhi, who was down with viral.“You made the mistake during the last assembly elections and the Lok Sabha elections. Do not repeat the mistake again for the prosperity of the state. Had we won the Lok Sabha elections, we would have implemented the Nyay Yojana. Now, Haryana has an opportunity to teach BJP a lesson for its wrongs,” said Rahul.Hitting out the BJP-led Union government over the slowdown, he said, “We had given Rs 70,000 crore to poor under MGNREGA. They had money and spending power. This helped the companies and investments to grow. Now, the Prime Minister is facilitating a few companies and money is going out of the country.”Claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi “does not know anything about economics”, he said, “Wrong decisions like demonetization and inception of GST have worsened the economy of the state. The time has come, when we have to facilitate the poor to strengthen the economy. This government has given a loan waiver of Rs 5.50 lakh crore to capitalists but they did not have money to give a waiver of Rs 70,000 crore to farmers and poor.”“We wonder, how and why Prime Minister Modi and BJP are silent over issues of unemployment, economy, law and order situation and other issues which are directly related to common man,” Rahul said.Earlier, HPCC chief and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja addressed the public meeting, seeking support for party candidates in Mahendergarh, Rewari and Kosli constituencies."

HISAR/GOHANAPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that his government would invest Rs 3.5 lakh crore in five years to cater to the need of water for drinking and irrigation purposes.“I will put maximum emphasis in the next five years on the water under the Jal Jeevan Mission. We are planning to spend Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next five years so that our mothers and sisters, and farmers don’t have to face the shortage of water. Our effort is to ensure that farmers do not have to rely only on weather,” said Prime Minister Modi, while addressing an election rally in Hisar.The Prime Minister said that the traditional water system should be revamped in villages and a system should be developed where the household water is recycled and is used for irrigation. “And I’m hopeful that the country will be successful in doing so by 2024,” said Modi.He said that the opposition has no right to ask for votes in Haryana as it has given the share of the state water to Pakistan during its rule at the Centre. He said that the “water over which Haryana farmers have the right will not flow into Pakistan now”.He was addressed two public meetings in Haryana on Friday, first in Gohana in Sonipat district and later in Hisar.Prime Minister Modi also slammed the opposition parties, saying that its leaders are busy fighting among themselves and cannot give stability to Haryana. “When the BJP government in Haryana was taking decisive steps for the development, what was the opposition doing? They could not fight with us. So, they were busy fighting among themselves. They destabilised their parties for self-interest. Can they give stability to Haryana,” asked Modi.Modi said Hisar was moving towards becoming the aviation centre of the country. “Earlier, people used to demand trains but now a washing yard for aeroplanes has been built in Hisar. The six-lane expressway between Delhi and Hisar has also been approved,” he said.In his address both in Gohana and Hisar, Modi didn’t forget to remind the public that Monday being a holiday owing to polling, making it an extended weekend, they should not miss the opportunity to exercise their franchise.Referring the number of athletes Sonipat has produced, he said: “This region has made India proud in every field, be it fighting in the wrestling ring or fighting against terrorism . Sonipat means Kisan, Jawan aur Pehlwan.”Patting Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar ’s back, Modi said corruption was rampant during the Congress’ rule. Even in sports, there was corruption. “But it all changed after 2014. Since then the government has taken several steps in the field of sports.”The PM said the Congress in the state has already accepted defeat. “It was clear in their talks in the video that they were saying that it would be enough if they win 10-15 seats. These are their words and made just before the elections. Those who have already accepted their defeat and gave up the ground can’t do anything for Haryana,” Modi said while referring to a purported video which went viral a few days back.The video showed Congress leaders counting seats outside Parliament and arguing about their dismal prospects across the state.Speaking of Jannayak Janata Party, the PM said the scope of the party was limited and its ideology shrinking. “This is the time to decide for the future and the youth of the country. This old vote bank politics of JJP cannot inspire the younger generation. Its politics and strategy have been rejected by the people of Haryana,” Modi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said no one - neither jawans “nor farmers or sportspersons – were safe under the Congress’ “misrule”, while terming abrogation of Article 370 his real tribute to brave soldiers.Lashing out at the party for not supporting it on Balakot or Article 370 decisions, the Prime Minister asked “what sort of chemistry the Congress has with Pakistan”.“Pakistan uses the Congress to strengthen its case globally on issues against India,” he said. “Whenever we talk of Swachh Bharat or surgical strike, the Congress gets stomach ache. And if by chance anyone says Balakot, then the Congress starts jumping with pain. Pakistan uses them to strengthen their case globally, what sort of chemistry is this?” he added."

NAGPUR: The biggest poll battle in the state elections on October 21 will be witnessed in Nagpur South-West that has earned the tag of chief minister’s constituency.CM Devendra Fadnavis (49) is seeking fifth consecutive term as legislator from the city and a hat-trick from South-West seat. So confident he and his party are of the victory here that Fadnavis has left it to party men to manage his campaign. He has barely attended two public meetings here since he is busy touring across the state.Pitted against Fadnavis is a youthful Congress leader Ashish Deshmukh (45) who till two years ago was with the ruling BJP.It’s virtually a straight fight between Fadnavis and Deshmukh as candidates of smaller parties like BSP, and an independent Prashant Pawar, are too insignificant and likely to fall by the wayside. Fadnavis won last time by a margin of 59,000 votes defeating a more rooted Congress candidate Praful Gudadhe-Patil.This time no one from the Congress was willing to contest against Fadnavis knowing well what the outcome would be. Deshmukh, desperate to make a comeback in the Congress after re-joining it in 2017, was at the last moment offered the tough task and he boldly accepted the challenge.Fadnavis has never lost any election till date, right from the civic body (NMC) of which he got to be one of the youngest mayors. He entered the assembly by winning from Nagpur West in 1999 and again won the seat in 2009.He also from the newly created South-West constituency in 2009 and 2014. His image as a clean, sincere politician keen on grasping any situation with intellect has enabled him to rise so fast in public life.Fadnavis has already created a record becoming the second Maharashtra chief minister to complete a full-term. His term saw a big push being given to development projects not only in the city but in entire Vidarbha that was neglected for decades during the Congress rule.Since Fadnavis is campaigning for party candidates across the state, his campaign here is being handled by Sandip Joshi, ruling party leader in the NMC. Party MLC Anil Sole, mayor Nanda Jichkar and the whole party is engaged in the campaign.“We have set a target of victory margin of 1 lakh votes for Fadnavis. There is tremendous enthusiasm among voters who are proud that their vote would go on to make Fadnavis chief minister for the second term,” said Joshi.Asked if Fadnavis’ not getting time to canvass for himself was a setback, Joshi and Jichkar point out the tremendous response to the “I am Devendra too” theme of the campaign. “It will be vote for development that the city witnessed in last five years by way of road works and Metro project. Mihan has taken off only in the last five years creating 17,000 jobs. Before that it was languishing for a decade,” Joshi said.Deshmukh said he is in the ring to create history. “I will surprise all with a giant-killer win. Fadnavis will be defeated as voters do not like their representative staying so far away from them. He has locked up his house here and stays in Mumbai where he is inaccessible to common man. Every section of society is angry with BJP. Traders, businessmen reeling under slowdown, students supporting ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ agitation, residents tired of unending road and Metro work, the unemployed waiting for opportunities are all going to vote against the BJP,” he said.His campaign paints Fadnavis as failure on all fronts mainly providing employment to youths. They have to look for jobs in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru leaving old, ailing parents behind. “Mihan has failed to provide promised jobs,” said Deshmukh.Deshmukh claims to have a better and more studied vision of development and if elected would concentrate on improving ease of living for people. “Education and health are two issues that BJP government has not bothered to address. I will work to improve government schools and introduce mohalla clinics like in Delhi. I will create situation that would bring prosperity to every household,” he said."

HISAR/GOHANA: Prime minister Narendra Modi on Friday during a campaign rally in Hisar took a swipe at Pakistan over the issue of water and said that he always accomplishes what he decides to do. Islamabad on Thursday had warned India that any attempt to divert flow of rivers will be considered an act of aggression.“Ek baar thaan liya, use kar ke hi rehta hoon. Mein Hisar ke bhaiyon aur behanon ko kehta hoon, aap ke haq ka paani ab Pakistan nahin bahega. Aur Modi hai, yeh kar ke rahega. Aur iske liye har zaroori kadam uthane shuru kar diye hai (Once I decide to do something, I always accomplish that. The water over which Haryana farmers have the right will not be allowed to flow to Pakistan now. I am Modi and I will accomplish this. We have started to take necessary steps for this),” he said.In a direct dig at Pakistan’s response to his statement at an earlier rally in Haryana on stopping water flowing to the neighbouring country, Modi said: “Aur mein paani bolta hoon toh aag wahan lagti hai (I talk of water here and it upsets them there).”The Prime Minister said that his government would invest Rs 3.5 lakh crore in five years to cater to the need of water for drinking and irrigation purposes.“I will put maximum emphasis in the next five years on the water under the Jal Jeevan Mission. We are planning to spend Rs 3.5 lakh crore in the next five years so that our mothers and sisters, and farmers don’t have to face the shortage of water. Our effort is to ensure that farmers do not have to rely only on weather,” said Prime Minister Modi, while addressing an election rally in Hisar.The Prime Minister said that the traditional water system should be revamped in villages and a system should be developed where the household water is recycled and is used for irrigation. “And I’m hopeful that the country will be successful in doing so by 2024,” said Modi.He addressed two public meetings in Haryana on Friday, first in Gohana in Sonipat district and later in Hisar.Modi also slammed the opposition parties, saying that its leaders are busy fighting among themselves and cannot give stability to Haryana. “When the BJP government in Haryana was taking decisive steps for the development, what was the opposition doing? They could not fight with us. So, they were busy fighting among themselves. They destabilised their parties for self-interest. Can they give stability to Haryana,” asked Modi.Modi said Hisar was moving towards becoming the aviation centre of the country. “Earlier, people used to demand trains but now a washing yard for aeroplanes has been built in Hisar. The six-lane expressway between Delhi and Hisar has also been approved,” he said.In his address both in Gohana and Hisar, Modi didn’t forget to remind the public that Monday being a holiday owing to polling, making it an extended weekend, they should not miss the opportunity to exercise their franchise. Referring the number of athletes Sonipat has produced, he said: “This region has made India proud in every field, be it fighting in the wrestling ring or fighting against terrorism. Sonipat means Kisan, Jawan aur Pehlwan.”Patting chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s back, Modi said corruption was rampant during the Congress’ rule. Even in sports, there was corruption. “But it all changed after 2014. Since then the government has taken several steps in the field of sports.”In Video: I accomplish what I decide: PM Narendra Modi to Pakistan on water threat"

MUMBAI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday accused the previous Congress government of failing to act after terror attacks in Mumbai.Addressing his last campaign rally for the Maharashtra Assembly elections Modi also spoke of the economic reforms brought in by the BJP-led Central and Maharashtra governments, which he said had no ""stain of corruption"" on them.""We can't forget the wounds of the Mumbai bomb blasts. The then (Congress) government didn't do justice with the victims' families and the reason for such a stance is now becoming known,"" he said.""Instead of nabbing those responsible for the terror attacks, those in power then indulged in mirchi (chillies) business (with the perpetrators),"" he said.r,"" Modi said.His comment """" was a veiled reference to NCP leader Praful Patel being summoned by ED in connection with a money laundering probe linked to the alleged illegal assets of Iqbal Mirchi, an aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.""When evidence with probe agencies after the terror attacks pointed out to masterminds across the border, Congress leaders instead said the attacks were the handiwork of those in India,"" he said.Describing Mumbai as ""city of opportunities"", Modi said Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has provided a stable government in the state.Modi said the Fadnavis government focused on the city's growth unlike the previous ""corrupt"" Congress-NCP governments.""There is not even a single stain of corruption on our government. We are trying to fulfill dreams of all, from farmers to those launching start-ups. Most of the services have gone online, reducing corruption,"" Modi said.The previous governments, Modi alleged, tried to fulfill dreams of the corrupt.""On the other hand, the Fadnavis government is fast- tracking Maharashtra's development,"" Modi said.Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray also addressed the rally.

Q: How many seats do you think

Q: Have Shiv Sena’s protests and statements against BJP, Prime Minister

Q: Despite Shiv Sena being an alliance partner in the Devendra Fadnavis-led coalition government, it opposed cutting down of trees in the Aarey forest for the Metro project. Do you think such issues will confuse the people and finally go against both of you?

Q: Why did Shiv Sena accept a status junior to BJP in its own state this time around? It had contested the previous assembly election separately. Why did it not contest separately in this election?

Q: Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray never contested any election. His son and incumbent chief of the party, Uddhav Thackeray, followed his father’s footsteps. Why has Uddhav’s son Aaditya Thackeray chosen to break away from tradition and contest an election?

Q: Is Aaditya Thackeray also eyeing the chief minister or deputy chief minister’s post?

A: I think we are looking at winning more than 100 seats. Simply because the people have seen our commitment to issues which concern the state. Whether we are in the government or outside, we have reached out to the people of the state. Issues that we have raised are very relevant. Also, the opposition has absolutely nothing to show in terms of convincing the people about what they feel is our ineffective governance. We have given clean governance as per the expectations of the people.A: I think people expect honesty and integrity in governance. Two political parties can broadly agree on ideological issues and a common vision for Maharashtra. But they could have their own perspective and point of view. Every time we have raised our voice, it is to represent the people of the state. We have been the voice of the people. As an alliance that has been together for 30 years, we think it is our responsibility to ensure that governance does not suffer at the expense of not listening to the voice of the people. The issues have been critical. As far as BJP and Shiv Sena are concerned, we have thrashed out these issues and resolved them, which is a win-win situation for Maharashtra, for governance and for the alliance.A: It doesn’t go against the spirit of the alliance. It is not a BJP versus Shiv Sena issue. This is city versus environment. We are already talking about how to ensure the city and environment can co-exist and they are not looked at in silos. Development cannot come at the cost of harming our environment, cutting down forests and doing away with wildlife. We want to ensure that the forest that exists in our city is not destroyed. Secondly, as far as the Metro project is concerned, we are in agreement that the city needs the Metro, development and better travel infrastructure support, but this particular issue is about the environment where there are other options that exist but have not been explored by Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL). We will sit down with the government and thrash this out and ensure that Aarey remains a forest. Thirdly, it is also about change of land use. It will open up the entire Aarey forest and not just 500 to 700 trees. It will lead to rampant construction and development. This will lead to more land mafia involving themselves and creating problems for the city.A: It is nothing like a junior and senior partner partnership. Our aim is great governance in the state and working on common ideologies and vision, yet not compromising on our own set of beliefs. We are long-term allies for the past 30 years. As an ally we have even stayed out of power without compromising on issues. When Congress and NCP were in power, Shiv Sena never chose to break away from our alliance. As far as Shiv Sena and BJP contesting the 2014 assembly election separately, we did realise after the exercise, and so did the BJP, that people of Maharashtra expect us to be strong as a unit and we have to contest together.A: This is absolutely fair. Traditions are not something that cannot be broken. Every generation brings about a different style of leadership. Aaditya at 29 is willing to take charge, be held accountable and be held responsible and come on the back of an elected mandate. Secondly, Balasaheb Thackeray always espoused his belief as far as his leadership is concerned. Same with Uddhav ji. He has managed to steer the party along and only strengthen it in time. So, it is about sense of leadership.A: He [Aaditya] has clearly said that he is enjoying the process of contesting an election, seeking the mandate of the people, emerging victorious and will also take on any responsibility that comes his way as per the expectations of the people. He has already said that in his mind he is the “CM”, which is a “common man”. He will always remain the common man of Maharashtra.A: There is no contradiction and there will never be a contradiction. The alliance only continues to grow in strength. Recently, Uddhav Thackeray categorically said that as the party president he had given a promise to his father that every Shiv Sainik will work towards making a Shiv Sainik the chief minister. Every political party aspires towards building itself, towards expanding itself and towards reaching the goal that it has set for itself. This is the Shiv Sena’s goal. It doesn’t come with a timeline but it definitely comes with the intent that Maharashtra will have a chief minister from the Shiv Sena.A: Both political parties are different in their identities, they have a separate mandate that they get from the people of the state. Their manifestos have only added value to each other’s manifestos. Also, Uddhav ji categorically said in a press conference that because we did not have the time to sit together and come out with a common manifesto, nothing much should be read out of it. It is the common vision that both share.A: The Congress-NCP alliance's failure is not about a particular investigation case. It is about the people of the state rejecting their alliance because of the immense corruption that was involved during their 15 years of rule at the expense of the people."

NEW DELHI: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Friday hit out at the Centre over reports that rural household consumption had slumped to a seven-year low, saying the ""callous"" government is enthusiastic about writing off unpaid loans of rich borrowers and tax cuts for the super-rich but shows no signs of concern over the slowdown.Yechury said the signs of the agrarian distress and near-stagnant rural incomes have been there for long but the Modi government is busy with trying to ""divide and polarise"".A media report said in the September quarter, rural India grew at five per cent in terms of value, sharply slower than 20 per cent reported in the year earlier. Urban India grew at eight per cent compared with 14 per cent in the year-ago period, he said.""A callous Central government shows no signs of concern over the slowdown tumbling into a much graver problem. There is enthusiasm in Modi govt only for tax cuts for the super-rich and writing off unpaid loans of rich borrowers.""The signs of the prolonged agrarian distress and near-stagnant rural incomes have been there for long. But this govt is busy with trying to divide and polarise,"" Yechury said in a tweet.He further said that the government's policies have hurt all sections of society.""Farmers, landless wage workers, workers in cities, youngsters, women looking for jobs, lakhs of sacked workers in auto, textiles and other sectors, industry workers, small entrepreneurs: its an endless list: Modi govt's policies have hurt all sections, except rich cronies,"" he tweeted."

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has sought the Union government and the state of Haryana’s response on a plea filed by Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala , seeking directions to provide him a security cover through a central security agency. In his petition, Dushyant has informed HC about threat to his life from an international gang.When the matter came up for hearing before Justice Sanjay Kumar of HC on Thursday, additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain appeared on behalf of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and told the HC that government is assessing the perception of threat as claimed by Dushyant. Jain further informed that it is a state subject and Centre provides security only in those cases where the perception of threat is very high. He, however, said that matter is under examination of central agency.The Haryana government counsel informed the court that already an additional security personnell has been provided to Dushyant after his complaint. However, the petitioner’s counsel informed that as gunmen cannot accompany Dushyant in the chopper, no security personnel has been provided to him when he lands in any area for campaigning in assembly polls.During hearing, Justice Kumar orally asked the state government to examine if any security personnel can be provided to him at the place where his chopper lands.HC has now adjourned the hearing of the case for Friday, asking the counsels for Union and state government to seek instructions from the respective governments on the issue.In his plea filed through advocate Naresh Shekhawat, the former Hisar MP, who is now contesting assembly polls from Uchana assembly seat, claimed to have received a call from a person calling from Dubai. According to the petition, he has been threatened not to campaign vigorously in the state assembly elections, else he would face dire consequences. According to Dushyant, the man who allegedly threatened him claimed that he was a member of an international gang. After Dushyant’s complaint, an FIR has also been registered in this regard by Jind district police."

JIND: Flags, banners and hoardings of political parties and leaders are missing in the run-up to the Haryana assembly elections this time, which was quite a common sight in the 2014 assembly polls.Even the supporters used to hang flags on the roofs/balconies of their houses to express their loyalty towards candidates and parties. However, during recent visits by TOI to several parts of the state, including Charkhi Dadri , where ace wrestler Babita Phogat is in the poll fray as the BJP candidate, Tosham where Congress’s stalwart Kiran Choudhry is contesting, Aadampur where Kuldeep Bishnoi of the Congress and BJP’s Tik Tok star Sonali Phogat are locked in a close contest as well as Jind, Fatehabad, Kaithal and other areas, the flags, banners and hoardings are conspicuous by their absence. Election Commission of India (ECI) guidelines are being stated as the reason for this volte-face.Talking to TOI, Uchana Kalana sub-divisional magistrate-cum-returning officer Rajesh Khoth said, “After model code of conduct for the assembly elections came into force, Defacement of Property Act was imposed on political parties and people, which bans pasting or fixing election material without permission. We have formed flying squads as well as monitor through C-vigil application to keep a close watch at village-level. Also, under the systems voters’ education electoral participation (SVEEP) programme, awareness is being spread among people.”Jind-based Sandeep Kumar, who runs a printing unit that makes flex boards and other promotion material, said, “None of the party candidates have approached us. I have invested Rs 10 lakh in the business. Usually, during the poll season, we earn Rs 15,000 a day by printing poll campaign material, but it has been very lean so far. I will incur huge losses this time.”"

PEHOWA ( KURUKSHETRA ): The initiation into politics has meant three-four hours of sleep and 16-20 meetings every day for 33-year-old Arjuna awardee and former hockey skipper Sandeep Singh aka Soorma, the BJP’s novice candidate from Pehowa assembly seat.Sandeep, a DSP-rank officer in Haryana Police , has by now settled into his role as a politician. He wears the almost-requisite white kurta pajama along with a saffron or BJP scarf around his neck. He is locked in a direct contest with Congress’s Mandeep Singh Chatha, son of five-time MLA and former minister and speaker Harmohinder Singh Chatha.Former Pehowa MLA Jaswinder Sandhu’s son Gagandeep Sandhu and his family have joined the Congress, so Chatha is giving a tough challenge to Sandeep, who is largely banking on PM Narendra Modi rally and his celebrity image. Others in the fray include JJP’s Randhir Singh, an educationist and close associate of Ajay Singh Chautala , and Nasib Singh of Loktantra Suraksha Party.Surrounded by his core team, friends and supporters, Sandeep is every inch a politician and is addressed as ‘Paa ji’ and ‘Bhai sahab’ by the people who know him. “Why should I disclose my strategy to you?” says Sandeep, when asked how he was planning to woo voters and win the seat. “We just get three-four hours of sleep and are ready for the next day. No issues, I am here by choice and this is public life. This is the first step towards my mission of jan sewa (public service),” adds Sandeep, who is also known as ‘ Flicker Singh ’ for his exception drag flick in hockey.When asked how he managed to adapt to the routine of a politician, Sandeep cites his “background of struggle”. “We know what struggle is and how to conquer it. For me, only jan sewa and desh sewa (country service) are motive and mission,” he adds.Having proved his expertise as a penalty corner expert in hockey, Sandeep is good at managing to make his mark in a short time during the campaign and presents himself as a politician who is well versed with local issues.Starting his day with a brief meeting with a core group — the team assigned to him by BJP for campaign — on his day’s programme, Sandeep starts campaigning immediately afterwards.To save time, he takes control of microphone and takes the centerstage soon after reaching the venue of his public meeting. “We are here not to rule, but to serve people. PM Modiji has a vision (for the nation) and CM Manohar Lal ji has a vision for the state. And, I have a vision for villages. Empowering my sisters and women with a source of income, I have a special plan for children too,” Sandeep tells the audience gathered at the chaupal of Shahpur village.Sandeep’s father Gurcharan Singh, a former sportsperson, holds the fort at the war room set up on Chandigarh Road in Pehowa. “Sandeep takes his decisions independently and proves that he is right. We are a family of sportspersons, and now he is a first-generation politician. We are sure of his success and his entry would be another milestone in politics,” says a proud Gurcharan."

THANE/MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said his party's decision to seal a pre-poll pact with BJP was largely influenced by the Modi regime's move to scrap the controversial Article 370 The announcement is largely seen as an attempt to silence critics who have been raising questions over the party's move to accommodate for lesser seats in the alliance. The announcement gains importance especially after Modi recently dared political opponents to rewind Article 370 in the Valley.The Sena president, in Thane to campaign for saffron alliance candidates, praised the 'nationalism' of Veer Savarkar as he forcefully iterated the demand for a Bharat Ratna to be conferred on him. The support for Bharat Ratna could help Sena not only find favour among Marathi-speaking people in Thane, which also has a sizeable Hindu population, but also grow closer to BJP, that has been idealising Savarkar.Earlier, in Manvelpada, Virar (E) to campaign for Nalasopara candidate, Pradeep Sharma, and Vasai candidate, Vijay Patil, he said, in Vasai-Virar, water does not come from taps, it comes from doors, referring to flooding in the region this year.Despite Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) having a majority in the municipality, it could not find a solution to the flood, Thackeray said."

PATNA: BJP national president Amit Shah put to rest on Thursday all speculation about a rift in the Bihar NDA, declaring that the upcoming assembly elections in the state would be fought under the leadership of JD (U) national president and CM Nitish Kumar Shah said the alliance is firm and any bickering was only among lower-level workers.""The alliance between JD(U) and BJP is ""atal (unshakable)"".

NEW DELHI: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by referring to him as 'BechendraModi', a moniker the Wayanad MP used to allege the Prime Minister was ""selling"" public sector companies to benefit his friends in the corporate world.Rahul Gandhi also posted a cartoon of the Prime Minister ""selling"" Air India, BPCL as well as the country itself. ""#BechendraModi is sharing the spoils () of the sale of public sector undertakings (PSUs) with his suitedbooted friends.

On Thursday, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , while interacting with investors in Mumbai, also said that he saw little hope that India would be able to achieve the $5-trillion-economy target by 2024."

NEW DELHI: On a day Congress attacked BJP for pledging to bestow the country's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , the saffron party came out strongly in favour of its poll promise made in Maharashtra and said Congress leaders were ""ignorant"" of their own party senior's views.Union minister Jitendra Singh tweeted a letter written by the late Indira Gandhi in 1980 in which she called Savarkar a ""remarkable son of India"" and extended her full support to plans to celebrate his birth centenary year.""I have received your letter of 8th May 1980.

I wish success to the plans to celebrate the birth centenary of this remarkable son of India,"" Indira had written in reply to a letter from Pandit Bakhle, secretary, Swatantrayaveer Savarkar Rashtriya Smarak, Dadar, Mumbai.Stating that the letter showed contradictions within Congress, Singh said those who questioned Savarkar were not familiar with his true story about how he was ahead of his contemporaries in visualising a free Indian society.""Savarkar was not only a nationalist and patriot but he also worked for rehabilitation of co-prisoners. He was in jail for 12 years-Besides, he had formed a union of prisoners against the British,"" Singh told TOI.In its manifesto for the Maharashtra assembly elections, BJP has promised to propose the names of Savarkar, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule and Annabhau Sathe for Bharat Ratna. Former PM Manmohan Singh said in Mumbai that Congress was not in favour of what ""Savarkarji patronised and stood for"", as he spoke about his party's opposition to the demand for Bharat Ratna for him. Singh, however, said Indira Gandhi as PM had issued a postal stamp in Savarkar's memory."

MUMBAI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday said his successor Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman should stop blaming the UPA regime for the crisis in the economy as the NDA had been in office for over five years which is ""long enough period"" for a government ""to do some credible things"".""When I was in office, what happened did happen. There were some weaknesses, but you can't claim the fault lies with UPA always. Mainly passing the buck to UPA is not enough. The government is obsessed with trying to somehow fix the blame on its opponents. In the process, it is unable to find a solution that will ensure the revival of the economy, particularly strengthening of our banking system,"" said Singh, speaking at a Congress meet on the state of the economy.A couple of days ago, Sitharaman had said Indian public sector banks had their ""worst phase"" when Singh was the PM and Raghuram Rajan was RBI governor.Highlighting what he called NDA's utter failure on the economic front, former PM Manmohan Singh said: ""With growth rate declining year after year, I don't think there's any hope of economy reaching the target of $5 trillion by 2024.""On the PMC Bank crisis , Singh asked Modi and Sitharaman to address the plight of 16 lakh depositors as a top priority. ""Indeed, it is unfortunate that lakhs are suffering following the fraud involving officials and directors of the bank.""The former PM strongly defended NCP leader Praful Patel who has been summoned by ED on Friday in connection with a financial deal involving Hajra Iqbal Memon, wife of the late drug lord Iqbal Memon ""Mirchi"".He said ED's action appears to be an act of political vendetta. ""Our laws are clear. So long as he is not guilty, he is considered as innocent. In my opinion, central agencies should not be used to settle political scores against rivals.""The former PM clarified that Congress had not opposed but supported the proposal to nullify Article 370 in Parliament. ""We are not opposed to (the move on) Article 370. Our contention is that the NDA government could not secure the goodwill of the people of J&K owing to high-handedness at all levels.""On the Maharashtra BJP's proposal in its manifesto to confer the Bharat Ratna on Veer Savarkar, Singh said Congress was never against Savarkar but was against the ideology of Hindutva promoted by him.In Video: PMC Bank scam: Expect Centre, RBI to provide credible solution, says Manmohan Singh"

VARANASI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday stressed the need to rewrite history from India's perspective, saying had it not been for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , the British portrayal of the 1857 uprising as just a mutiny by Indian sepoys in the East India Company 's army would have still ruled the roost.""It was Savarkar who gave the name first war of Independence to the 1857 'kranti', otherwise our children would have known it as a revolt,"" Shah said. His comments came against the backdrop of BJP's push for a Bharat Ratna for Savarkar, something which has been seen as an ambitious effort to put the Hindutva icon on a pedestal.Shah, who was here to inaugurate a two-day international seminar ""Remembering Guptavanshaik-Veer Skandgupta Vikramaditya and Political Future of India"" at the Banaras Hindu University, said history has always been written by the victor; those who succeed in capturing power.""India never invaded any foreign territory, but we have our own heroes like Skandgupta who defeated the Hunas when they had conquered a large part of Asia and Europe and had seemed invincible. It is unfortunate that our children don't know about the great ruler (Skandgupta) who extended India's boundary from Junagarh to Afghanistan. It is also unfortunate that his merits and contributions are ignored and there are not enough historical references about him,"" Shah said.""It is the responsibility of our historians and people to preserve and rewrite the nation's history. How long will we go on cursing the British saying they did injustice to us? Who is stopping us from rewriting (history)? We should not get into controversies over past writings. Instead, we should write history with our own view,"" he said.It is very important to rewrite the country's history with an Indian point of view. I believe there is no point blaming Left, British or Mughal historians. If our historians cannot ensure that our 200 great personalities and 25 great empires which flourished here get their rightful place in our history, we have to change our vision and rethink our approach,"" he added.Praising Skandgupta's achievements, Shah said, ""Literature, military, culture and art were world class. The country had the best astrologers during the period and India was freed of invaders from Kashmir to Kandahar. We need to include Skandgupta's contribution in our history.""Addressing the historians on the dais and in the audience, the home minister said, ""We don't have to dispute anything, only write the truth and it will stand the test of time."" Shah also praised Madan Mohan Malaviya for founding BHU where ""Hindu dharma and sanskriti are still propagated after so many years"". He praised PM Modi for making India ""regain"" its respect in the world. ""Respect for our country has increased. The world pays attention to our views. It listens when our PM speaks,"" he said.In Video: Amit Shah calls for re-writing history to reflect India's point of view"

KOLKATA: The ruling Trinamool Congress on Thursday mocked BJP president Amit Shah for ""day dreaming"" about forming the next government in Bengal with two-thirds majority and said he and his saffron camp should instead concentrate on reviving the economy.Amit Shah, also the Union home minister, had told a news channel during the day that BJP is going to form the government in West Bengal with two-thirds majority in the 2021 assembly polls.Reacting to Amit Shah's claim, senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee said the BJP president should stop ""day dreaming"" about forming the government in the state.""Instead of day dreaming and making tall claims the BJP leader should first concentrate on his own party and good governance at the Centre. The country's economy has gone for a toss due to the faulty economic policies of the Modi government and BJP should first look into reviving it,"" he said.TMC also hit out at the BJP government at the Centre for allegedly trying to drive out Bengalis from Assam in the name of implementation of the National Register of Citizens.The saffron party is planning to replicate the NRC exercise in Bengal but as long as TMC is in power in the state it will never allow such an ""divisive exercise"" to take place, TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said.""The BJP is trying to create a panic in Bengal in the name of NRC. Eleven people have already died in the state due to NRC panic. The people of Bengal will give BJP a befitting reply in the next assembly polls in the state,"" he said.The omission of a large number of Hindu Bengalis from the final NRC list in BJP-ruled Assam had apparently created panic among the people in West Bengal. Hundreds of them had lined up at government and municipal offices here and across West Bengal in September to collect their birth certificates and necessary documents to be in readiness should NRC be implemented in the state despite assurances by the TMC government that it would not be allowed.More than 19 lakh people in Assam have been excluded from the recently published final NRC on August 31. TMC is opposed to the implementation of NRC in the country."

MUMBAI: Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Friday cautioned the Narendra Modi government against using investigative agencies to pursue ""political vendettas"".The Enforcement Directorate has got more powers than ever under the Modi government, and these powers should be used judiciously, he said.Singh's comments came at a time when his former cabinet colleague P Chidambaram is in jail after being arrested in the INX Media case.In Maharashtra, NCP leader Praful Patel has been called for questioning by the ED with regard to a property deal. The agency has also named NCP chief Sharad Pawar in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam.""I sincerely hope that political vendettas will not be used to settle scores with politicians of different hues,"" Singh, whose own government had once faced allegations of using central agencies such as CBI for political gains, said.""The ED has now got more powers than it had ever before, our hope is these powers will be used not to settle political scores,"" he said, addressing a press conference here ahead of Maharashtra assembly polls.He was replying to a question about the ED summoning Patel, another former ministerial colleague of his.Singh expressed confidence that the government will ensure that Patel gets justice, underlining that he should be presumed innocent till proven guilty."

NASHIK: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""doob maro"" jibe directed at the opposition in connection with scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.Addressing a poll rally in Niphad here in north Maharashtra, Pawar asked Modi why was he daring the opposition leaders to bring back Article 370 of the Constitution after it was nullified by Parliament in August.Pawar also hit out at Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for saying that public sector banks had the ""worst phase"" under the combination of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan.The Maratha strongman was a senior member of the Manmohan Singh-led cabinet.Modi had on Wednesday slammed the opposition leaders, seeking a link between the scrapping of Article 370 and the Maharashtra assembly polls, and told them to ""go drown"" (doob maro) for criticising the nullification of the controversial provision that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.""How can they (Opposition) say that Jammu and Kashmir has nothing to do with Maharashtra? They should be ashamed of such thoughts. Don't they have any shame? Doob maro,"" the PM had said, using the two-word phrase in Hindi.Referring to the comment, Pawar said, ""Parliament abrogated Article 370. Modi sahib took the initiative. We do not oppose that. Some people kept forth their views on the issue, but they were labelled by some as anti-national. They become anti-nationals?""""The Prime Minister yesterday said doob maro. He dares us to bring Article 370 back. It was decided to scrap Article 370, Parliament scrapped it and now why are you now talking about bringing it back?"" he questioned.The former Union minister further said that there were several issues concerning the people, yet BJP leaders were consistently talking about defanging of Article 370.The only answer BJP leaders had for any of the people's issue was Article 370, Pawar quipped.On Sitharaman's remark, Pawar said, ""Are these people not aware of the tradition of this country? We never criticise the Prime Minister when abroad. They should also be mindful of this tradition.""Sitharaman had made the remarks while delivering a lecture at the Columbia University in the US.Pawar targeted the BJP-led government in Maharashtra over farmer suicides and job losses in the state, saying it did not pay attention towards these key issues.Maharashtra, which has a 288-member assembly, will vote on October 21 and results will be announced on October 24."

NEW DELHI: With the Maharashtra assembly election just days away, the BJP has gone all out to invoke warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. While BJP’s aim is to garner votes, the move is likely to leave its alliance partner Shiv Sena , which draws its name and ideology from the Maratha king, uncomfortable.Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah , who is also the Union home minister, have been invoking Shivaji at their election rallies in Maharashtra. Their poll meetings are replete with symbolism linked to the Maratha warrior king.While addressing an election rally in Panvel in Raigad district of Maharashtra on October 16, Modi said he was visiting the capital of Shivaji Maharaj's Hindvi Swaraj. “Coming here again means bowing head at the place of inspiration and drawing new inspiration and energy from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj . What more fortunate thing than this can there be in life?” he said.The PM said Chhatrapati Shivaji's life and ideals are continuously inspiring the BJP and showing them the path of good governance. “Protection of the motherland and public welfare are the biggest responsibilities of any government. The BJP-led NDA governments at the Centre and in Maharashtra in the last five years have drawn inspiration from Shivaji and tried to carry out their responsibilities in accordance with his ideals,” he said.A photograph of Narendra Modi with a bust of Shivaji at the Raigad rally, which went viral, was also shared by BJP’s in-charge of information and technology Amit Malviya with the caption “Iconic picture!”.Not just PM Modi, Amit Shah too has been relying heavily on Shivaji, invoking him at most rallies with slogans such as “Jai Shivaji” and “Jai Bhavani”, both associated with the warrior king.The choice of places being visited by both Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are also strategic. On October 10, the BJP president addressed a rally at Tuljapur, where the 12th century Tulja Bhavani temple is situated. Bhavani was Shivaji’s protective patron deity (Kul Devi), He had dedicated his sword, Bhavani Talwar, in her veneration. Shivaji's mother Jijabai was considered to be a devotee of Bhavani.At Tuljapur, Amit Shah said Shivaji spread the concepts of swaraj (self-rule) and swadharm (self duty) from here till Afghanistan. “The freedom struggle drew inspiration from Shivaji’s concepts of swaraj and swadharm,” he said.The next day, on October 11, Amit Shah addressed an election rally at Chikhali in Buldhana, which is Jijabai’s birthplace. He said it was Jijabai who nursed Shivaji and inspired him to fight for self-rule.Asked if BJP was trying to appropriate Shivaji from Shiv Sena as it was doing in the case of Congress icons such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, BR Ambedkar and Subhash Chandra Bose, Amit Malviya denied it and said, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is venerated across Maharashtra as a leader who stood for their cultural pride and progress. BJP is honouring Great Shivaji Maharaj’s legacy. It is not a political issue for BJP but one of recognising our rich culture and its icons.”Shiv Sena has refused to comment on the issue.While BJP is contesting on 164 of the 288 Maharashtra assembly seats, Shiv Sena is fighting on 124 seats."

AKOLA/MUMBAI/AURANGABAD: A day after BJP in Maharashtra promised that it would push for a Bharat Ratna for Vinayak Damodar Savarkar or Veer Savarkar , PM Narendra Modi enthusiastically embraced the idea at a rally in Akola, boosting the prospects of the Hindutva icon getting India's highest civilian honour.Referring to Savarkar, the PM said it was due to ""his (Savarkar's) sanskar (values) that we consider nationalism as the basis for nation-building."" He also rued that Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar had been denied the country's highest civilian award by Congress governments (he was given the award posthumously in 1990 by the Chandrashekhar government).Strongly defending the mention of J&K and revoking of Article 370 as a poll issue, Modi stated that many soldiers from the state had sacrificed their lives while battling terrorists in the state. Terming the opposition as ""shameless,"" the PM rebuked it with a """" comment for having raised questions on the revoking of Article 370. ""I want them to hear that Kashmir and its people will stay with Mother India,"" he said."

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday threw a counter challenge at PM Modi and asked him to remove all withdrawal limits imposed on the beleaguered PMC Bank and help its stricken customers, instead of harping on Article 370 and attempting to deflect attention from the issues that mattered.While campaigning in poll-bound Maharashtra, PM Modi had dared the opposition to promise that they would restore Article 370 in their poll manifestos. Congress, however, said instead of addressing issues like the agrarian crisis, unemployment and the deepening mess in the banking systems reflected in the collapse of the PMC bank, the PM and ruling BJP were harping on subjects to divide people and deflect attention from an economy in recession.Upping the ante against the ruling party as the Maharashtra and Haryana election campaigning enter their final lap before polling on October 21, AICC spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said, “We challenge the Prime Minister to make an announcement removing all withdrawal limits that have been imposed on PMC bank, affecting lakhs of consumers and disallowing them from withdrawing their own savings. And if Modi cannot do this, he should tell the country that he is incapable.”Arguing that people should be allowed to withdraw their money as per their own convenience, Congress also alleged that the crisis in PMC had led to the death of three depositors and held the government responsible for their deaths. Singh said the deaths should not be treated as natural death because they were triggered by the government’s mismanagement of the situation and demanded that the guilty be brought to book.Around 50 depositors of the scam-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank staged a protest outside the RBI demanding revoking restrictions on cash withdrawal, currently capped at Rs 40,000 over a six-month period. The protesters marched to RBI protesting against the suspension of banking operation since September 24."

PARTUR ( Maharashtra ): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday targetted Congress stating the party was on its deathbead as nepotism has overshadowed its nationalism.""Congress nationalism has been suppressed by nepotism.

Q: Does his act of going away from the country to Bangkok or Cambodia, wherever it is, damage Congress?

Q: But when the Congress’s rivals mock him, doesn't the party rank and file get demoralised?

Q: BJP leaders including its president Amit Shah accuse Congress of being a dynasty party. What do you have to say?

Q: But my point is dynasty in Congress.

Q: The dynasties you are talking about are at the lower level. What about the top level -- the party president’s post?

Q: Why hasn’t Congress analysed its defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election as yet?

Q: Salman Khurshid also said Congress hasn't really got together to analyse why it got defeated. Our biggest problem is our leader has walked away, he said.

Q: Where does Congress stand in the October 21 Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections?

Q: Senior Maharashtra Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has withdrawn from the election, casting aspersions on the leadership. Besides, there is him versus Milind Deora. How much harm will these developments do to Congress’s prospects in the forthcoming assembly election.

Q: In Haryana, state Congress president Ashok Tanwar rebelled against the leadership and resigned from the party. Has it not harmed Congress’s image?

Q: Several senior leaders have quit, not just in these two poll-bound states but others as well. Has this weakened the Congress?

A: The Indian economy is in a mess. Today the fundamentals of the Indian economy are under serious stress. If you look at each of the fundamentals - savings, borrowing, investment and consumption - savings to GDP ratio is at a historic low. Investments are non-existent, whether by domestic corporates or foreign corporates. In the first six months of the current financial year, there has been an 88 per cent reduction in offtake. For the same period last year, it was Rs 7.35 lakh crore off-take from the credit market. That has come down to Rs 90,000 crore. Consumption is not taking place which is evidenced by the manner in which the automobile sector has been haemorrhaging. There is a huge real estate bubble. There is exposure of $68 billion which the banks have to the real estate sector, which is completely in shambles. And obviously it has had a spin-off effect in terms of layoffs. Therefore, economic pain is real. Small establishments have been closing down across the country.A: My sense is that this economic crisis is going to deepen and worsen. We are not even aware of the full extent of the structural problems in the Indian economy. If you look at Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank or at IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services), there are examples where NBFCs, scheduled banks and commercial banks are in huge difficulty. The independence of the regulator - the central bank - stands severely undermined. There is no justification for the transfer of Rs 1.76 lakh crore reserve of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the central government.A: In my estimation, when people’s pockets start hurting, it does impact electoral choices.A: A complete clampdown on communication which is totally unprecedented and the lockdown of all opposition leaders and other social influencers -- that’s really been the story of the last two months. If the government felt that it had taken a decision which was in the interest of the people of J&K then why do you require such unprecedented and draconian security measures to really be able to bolster your decision? You need to understand that there is a whole section of people in J&K who do not believe in the democratic systems as their constitute. They prefer to remain outside the democratic system. All that Article 370 has achieved at the end of the day is that those people who were carrying the flag of India in J&K, who were part of the mainstream and who despite the depredations of Pakistani deep state and ISI continued to participate in the electoral processes, continued to uphold the unity and integrity of India, you have just completely annihilated them with one stroke.A: On the one hand there is the spiel that the BJP-led NDA government would want people to believe and on the other hand there is the reality in J&K. I have over the past two months not read a proper ground report done by an Indian journalist emanating from J&K.A: Well, Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha election got 12 crore votes. It’s another matter that in the first-past-the-post system we got 52 seats. But more often than not every party goes through this cyclic phase. But my own estimation is that we will come out stronger. You will see a robust rebound and Congress will continue to function as an effective and articulate opposition.A: First and foremost, Rahul Gandhi was elected president of Indian National Congress unanimously by an electoral college which consists of 10,000 PCC members spread across the length and breadth of our great land. Therefore, it is not as if he was anointed as the Congress president. In May 2019, he chose to resign. In my estimation, he did the honourable thing. In Indian democracy, there is no other example of someone taking responsibility for defeat and stepping down. I think he should actually be applauded for the conviction of his courage rather than being vilified.A: Everyone is entitled to his/her point of view and and as Congress president you can’t grudge him that. He penned down his thoughts. Poossibly others had not measured up to his expectations in terms of what he expected them to deliver. The fact remains he did step down.A: Look, I am not going to get into individuals. He has been elected to the Lok Sabha for the fourth time, and, therefore, it his his right to take decisions which he thinks are in his best interests.A: He is not the president of Indian National Congress. As an MP or a party functionary who is not at the apex of the party, if he decides to take a sabbatical to introspect it should not become an instrument to demonise anybody.A: That is the opinion of Rahul Gandhi baiters -- both in the media as well as the trolls created in the social media space. Every person has his or her own way of leading his or her own life. Therefore, I think this unnecessary attention which is given to microscopically and minutely examining every facet of somebody's life, I do not think democracy should function this way. Democracy is about issues and challenges that confront the country. It’s not about individual preferences or choices of any individual who is in the public space.A: Well, I am a little disappointed with the Indian media because all that they seem to have an obsession with is what Congress or a section of its leadership is or is not doing. Unfortunately, the primary role of the media, which is to have a constructively adversarial relationship with the government of the day, has been willingly and completely abdicated. It would be trite to say that what should have been a watchdog has become a lapdog. At times I am amazed at the pusillanimity and prostration which the Indian media has subjected itself to. I do not find any section of the media, whether print or electronic, actually holding the omissions of this government to account.A: We have gone over these questions ad nauseum over the last 20 years and they have been answered in great length and great detail. What about [Union minister] Anurag Thakur (former Himachal Pradesh chief minister PK Dhumal’s son) and [BJP MP] Dushyant [Singh] (former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje’s son)? Are they not dynasty? Dynasty actually means chief ministers' sons stepping into the political shoes of their parents. I can count at least 10 dozen BJP leaders whose sons have taken over the mantle.A: The way BJP is headed, that day is also not very far. You will also see that happening.A: An analysis has taken place. Various Pradesh Congress committees (PCCs) have had extensive sessions with regard to what possibly went wrong in their respective states. In so far as a larger national introspection is concerned, it does not have to be done only in the formal sense of the term that you appoint a committee that goes aroung talking to people and then prepares some documents. Introspection is done in many ways and at different forums. There have been serious, structured and focused discussions on what essentially went wrong.A: I don’t want to comment on individuals.A: Congress governed Maharashtra in coalition with NCP for 15 years. We were in government in Haryana for 10 years. Congress is fighting a spirited battle in both these states. Ultimately, it is the people who will take a final call.A: Sanjay Nirupam was possibly upset about one candidate of his not being considered for the ticket. Let me tell you, as someone who has now fought three elections, there is a discourse at the ether and there is discourse on the ground. Assembly and Parliament elections are actually fought on bread and butter issues. Therefore, you have this surreal discourse which floats in the ether which people believe is impacting electoral choices. But in my humble estimation, there are hard bread and butter issues which ultimately tilt elections one way or the other. Under those circumstances, you may have had a little storm in a teacup for half a day. But would that really impact elections? I don’t think so.A: In my opinion, my answer is no. As I explained to you, these are 90 different fights (Haryana has 90 assembly constituencies) and the issues in every assembly constituency are different.A: Several people had quit Congress in 1977 and a lot of people returned in 1980, again a lot of people quit in 1999 to return in 2004 and later. Therefore, there are some people who do not have the conviction of courage to be in it for the long haul. They are misfits wherever they go."

THANE: NCP leader Supriya Sule has questioned the presence of several central ministers and senior BJP leaders from across the country to campaign for the Maharashtra assembly polls, when chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is confident of an easy win.Addressing a rally at Kalyan town in Thane district of Maharashtra on Tuesday night for NCP nominee Prakash Tare, she dubbed the BJP's demand for the Bharat Ratna honour for Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar as an ""election gimmick"".Targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , who has been addressing a number of rallies in the state to campaign for the BJP, Sule sought to know why he did not pay a visit to Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli in August when the districts were ravaged by floods after heavy rains.""When the chief minister says there is no fight at all for the BJP in Maharashtra, what is the need for so many senior party leaders, including CMs of various states and Union ministers, to campaign in Maharashtra?"" she asked.""This shows the BJP is not sure of its victory,"" the Lok Sabha member from Baramati said.Hitting out at the BJP over its demand of the Bharat Ratna for Savarkar in its poll manifesto, Sule, who is the daughter of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, said it was nothing but an ""election gimmick"".Sule said she had earlier in the Lok Sabha sought the highest civilian honour for social reformers Savitribai Phule and Mahatma Phule for their contribution to society, and even presented a memorandum of her demand to Fadnavis.She accused the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena of ""ignoring"" several burning issues in the state and diverting people's attention from them.In her speech, she lauded the work of late NCP leader R R Patil towards development of the state, specially the cleanliness campaign undertaken by him."

KURUKSHETRA/KARNAL: The Election Commission's strict check on candidates' expenses has brought grand entertainment performances at political rallies to an end in Haryana and made parties fall back on good-old nukkad nataks to put their message across to voters while not burning a hole in the pocket.Haryana is set go to polls on October 21. Till some years ago, election rallies in Haryana meant dance and song performances to keep voters from leaving the venue before the arrival of the organising party's star campaigners.The entertainers ranged from top Ragini performers to popular Haryanavi singers. Apart from the EC's check on expenses, candidates are also staying away from organising such events to avoid controversies.Now, instead of hiring dancers and singers, political parties are hiring young actors to perform ""nukkad nataks"" (street plays), which glorify candidates and their parties in an entertaining way.The troupes, which largely hail from New Delhi, perform at a prominent public space, be it the main market of a town or the chaupal of a village. ""Haryana picked up this form campaigning from the Delhi assembly elections. We are hired by the headquarters of political parties. They take requirements from each constituency and deploy us accordingly. Since manifestoes have already been released, it becomes easy for us to prepare our scripts. We have common scripts and each is then customized according to the area, candidate and party,"" says Mohammad Akhtar, head of a troupe performing in Kurukshetra These troupes are paid somewhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 for each show, which lasts between five and ten minutes. Each troupe is required to stage between six and 10 such shows each day at pre-decided venues.Traditionally, Ragini singers, if sourced locally, would be paid less - Rs 500 or so - and kept happy with perks like bidis and a small amount of alcohol. However, big ticket Ragini events could cost anything between Rs 25,000 and Rs 8 lakh, depending on the performer.Raginis would also see a bit of innovation as some came to be known for poll campaigns.""Like our troupe, our friends and colleagues are performing across the state,"" says Akhtar. ""We only perform after the organiser takes appropriate permissions,"" he adds.His fellow artist Prabha says their troupe has performed similarly in Delhi, Rajasthan and Bihar too.These troupes may be in demand in urban areas, but the situation Haryana's countryside is still the same. ""They (nukkad natak actors) are modern-day baazigars. They pull the crowd and are liked by youngsters and urban voters. However, rural voters still look forward to bhajan mandlis or folk artists,"" says Hamir Singh, a resident of Karnal"

KURUKSHETRA: A garland worth Rs 5,000 was made to greet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kurukshetra , where he addressed a rally on Tuesday.The garland was presented to Modi at a theme park in the holy town.Shiv Kumar, the florist who got the garland made, said they send their supplies to welcome politicians during rallies. “The garland made for the Prime Minister is worth Rs 5,000. We feel proud after supplying a token of respect to the national leader. This gives us a chance of serving the PM. I had also supplied a similar garland during the PM’s earlier visit to Kurukshetra before the Lok Sabha polls.”Shiv’s father Ayodhya Prasad had started the business nearly 25 years ago. He passed away in 2014 and since then Shiv is taking care of the family business. “During elections, a large number of special orders are received. This is the time when we make some extra income. Almost all political parties order small and big garlands for using these on political stages and greeting leaders. The competition is stiff.”Shiv said the order for the garland was given by Sahil Sudha, son of BJP’s Thanesar candidate and sitting MLA Subhash Sudha. He said bundles of paddy straw were tied together as base to give shape to the garland, which was then wrapped and packed with newspapers. “Then the large garland is covered with a chain of marigold flowers and Ashoka tree leaves,” he said."

PANCHKULA: Former mayor of the Panchkula from Congress Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia , who was expecting to get the party ticket from the Panchkula assembly seat, backed Congress candidate Chander Mohan Bishnoi on Tuesday and showed full support to him to beat BJP in the upcoming elections. The mayor had altercations with BJP MLA Gian Chand Gupta during her tenure as she had alleged interruptions in her working as the mayor and that is the major reason she has come against BJP to support Chander Mohan.Ahluwalia said that the BJP-led government and Panchkula MLA tried their best and put in all efforts to remove her from the post and also became a hurdle in all the development works she suggested during her tenure. She said: “BJP government left no stone unturned to stop the development agendas during my tenure. In fact, just to see a mayor from their party, they made a lot of allegations against me.”Chander Mohan said: “Upinder Kaur is not ex-mayor of Panchkula but is a permanent mayor of Panchkula as during her tenure, works were carried out in the city.”Senior Congress leader Dhanendra Ahluwalia also campaigned for Chander Mohan."

AURANGABAD: Former cabinet minister Madhukar Chavan of Congress is the oldest candidate in the fray for upcoming assembly election in Maharashtra Till the last election, veteran Peasants and Workers Party (PWP) leader and 11-time MLA Ganpatrao Deshmukh (92) from Sangola in Solapur district was the oldest candidate.After Chavan, BJP leader Haribhau Bagde, 75, is the other older candidate in a fray this time. Bagde, who was speaker of the state legislative assembly, is seeking a re-election from Phulambri constituency in Aurangabad district.Chavan, who is seeking the sixth term as an MLA and fifth consecutive victory from Tuljapur assembly constituency in Osmanabad district, had served as a cabinet minister of animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries department and was the deputy speaker of the Maharashtra legislative assembly.Chavan, who began his career as a panchayat samiti member, went on to become an MLA and also served as chairman of Marathwada Development Board, a statutory body.Known for his characteristic ‘dhoti kurta’ attire, the octogenarian Congress leader had secured win from Tuljapur assembly constituency by a margin over 29,400 votes against NCP despite the ‘Modi wave’ in 2014. The BJP candidate had secured a third place.Party workers close to Chavan said the Congressman used to practice wrestling skills during his early age, which is the secret behind his sound health. “Despite being in his 80s, he still leads a very active public life. It is the reason party leadership could not think any name other than Chavan for Tuljapur constituency,” a party worker said.This time, he is pitched against Ranajagjitsinha Patil of BJP, who along with his father and veteran leader Padmsinh Patil, has ditched NCP on the face of election to join the saffron camp. Ranajagjitsinha was keen to contest assembly poll from Osmanabad assembly constituency, but BJP top-brass has pitched him from Tuljapur, which is considered a Congress bastion.Sena was not willing to give away Osmanabad seat to BJP in seat-sharing talks in the backdrop of arch rivalry between Patil family and Sena MP from Osmanabad Omraje Nimbalkar. Some prominent Sena leaders from Tuljapur are upset that the seat was allotted to BJP."

MUMBAI: BJP released its manifesto for the Maharashtra assembly elections on Tuesday, promising to propose the names of Veer Savarkar , Mahatma Jyotiba Phule, Savitribai Phule and Annabhau Sathe for the Bharat Ratna . The party also said it would create one crore jobs in the state over the next five years and spend Rs 5 lakh crore on infrastructure.The manifesto, which was unveiled by working president JP Nadda , also said all proposed memorials would be completed. A memorial for Atal Bihari Vajpayee would also be built.The Savarkar announcement triggered sharp reactions from the opposition, which accused the saffron party of showing its ""true colours"" of hardline Hindutva.For BJP, the focus on Savarkar sits well with the assertion by its national president Amit Shah that nationalism and defanging of Article 370 were relevant in the state election.While Hindu nationalists hail Savarkar as a freedom fighter, Congress - Rahul Gandhi in particular - has accused him of kowtowing to the British.BJP looks up to Savarkar as a national icon, as does the Sangh Parivar, as he formulated the theory of Hindutva in the early 1920s. Savarkar was never a part of RSS but was president of the Hindu Mahasabha for five years starting 1937.The promise comes at a time when BJP ally Shiv Sena has been pushing for a Bharat Ratna for Savarkar. The move is seen by a section of political observers as part of BJP's attempt to take an emotive issue away from its now-junior ally in the state.The inclusion of social reformers Sathe and the Phules, all of whom fought for elimination of the caste system, in the Bharat Ratna wishlist is expected to round off the BJP proposal with an inclusive touch.The manifesto also said one crore families would be connected to self-help groups and internet connectivity would be provided across the state. ""The manifesto has been prepared keeping future needs and challenges in mind,"" Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Housing for all by 2022, the flagship scheme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be accomplished along with drinking water connectivity and basic civic infrastructure, said the manifesto.The state government along with the Centre will spend Rs 5 lakh crore on infrastructure, besides a separate fund for road infrastructure, said the manifesto. Fadnavis said that given the fact that road construction agencies were overburdened, a separate agency would be set up to carry out maintenance of roads.In Video: Maharashtra Assembly elections: BJP releases party manifesto"

MUMBAI: Taking a dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said the speeches made by the former will eventually help the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance win more votes in assembly elections.Speaking at a rally at Pusad in Yavatmal district, the chief minister said Rahul Gandhi joined the campaign ""unwillingly"" in view of Congress leader Salman Khurshid's remarks.Khurshid had said the Congress had failed to carry out a detailed analysis of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, as Rahul Gandhi, the then president of the party, ""walked away"".""The Congress had won 42 seats in 2014 state assembly elections in Maharashtra. Knowing well that his party will not win more than 24 seats this time, Rahul was unwilling to campaign and instead had gone abroad,"" the chief minister said.""Congress leader Salman Khurshid recently said that party leaders ran away at the time of putting up a fight. Now, Gandhi has come and speaking the same old things,"" the chief minister said, referring to Rahul Gandhi raking up issues like Rafale deal, GST, demonetisation in his rallies held on Sunday.These issues were raised by Gandhi and the Congress in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP had won a massive mandate while the Congress fell by the wayside.""More Rahul Gandhi speaks, the votes of the BJP-Sena will keep rising,"" the chief minister said.Continuing his war of words with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Fadnavis said, unlike the past practice of funds for farmers getting ""siphoned off by middlemen"", the money is now directly deposited into their bank accounts under the BJP rule.The BJP is contesting 164 out of the total 288 seats in alliance with smaller parties for the October 21 assembly elections. Its principal ally, Shiv Sena is fighting in 124 constituencies under the ""Maha Yuti"" or grand-alliance."

MUMBAI: Till the early 1990s, Chandivali was unknown to most Mumbaikars. A studio built in the 1940s—way much before the now famous Film City came into existence— was probably the only habitable spot in the Andheri (East) locality. Studio owner Chandrarao Kadam, who wanted to provide outdoor locations for Bombay’s film-makers, bought the property in 1940, but it took him almost four years to clear and level the forested land.Today, his youngest son, Kiran Kadam (78), looks back Chandivali’s metamorphosis. “We did not even have a proper approach road to the studio in those days. The roads were flooded almost every monsoon. But there were very few such locations available to shoot films,” says Kadam's wife, Rohini.Lodged between Saki Naka and Powai, Chandivali has developed into one of the city’s most expensive neighbourhoods, characterised by tall residential highrises and an emerging IT hub. Its proximity to the premier IIT-Bombay is another reason why it is sought-after by startups.While Chandivali and Hiranandani Powai have had a rapid growth story, the neighbouring industrial units on Khairani Road and slums in Kurla, which falls under the same assembly constituency, stand in stark contrast.Residents in this largely neglected locality complain of deplorable living conditions and lack of basic amenities , including an accessible healthcare system. The slums are so densely populated that inadequate ventilation is a hazard for most residents. “Fresh air does not reach the slums, leave alone the small houses,” said Ramzan Chaudhury, a social activist from the area who is now affiliated to AIMIM. While bungalows and hotels have sprung up in the area, lakhs of residents continue to be neglected, said Chaudhury.Neglect is such that a bridge is yet to be rebuilt after it was brought down in March, said Iftikar Khan who runs an industrial unit. “This is not only increasing commute time for over 50,000 people, including students from four to five schools, but is also a risk during floods as it is over a roadside nullah. By contrast, another bridge brought down in Ghatkopar was quickly replaced,” said Khan.Chandivali became an assembly constituency only in 2009. It has the highest number of voters—around 3.8 lakh—in the city but their turnout has been dismal in the past two elections at 43-44%.Congress' candidate and four-time MLA Arif (Naseem) Khan continues to be a strong contender, though it remains to be seen how Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and AIMIM will impact his votes. “Even if candidates from these parties do not stand a chance against Khan, they are likely to leave a slight dent in his vote bank,” said an activist in Saki Naka.Khan's toughest contender is Shiv Sena's Dilip Lande, whom he defeated in the 2009 polls by a huge margin of 33,715 votes. Lande was then an MNS candidate. Khan polled 73,141 votes in 2014 and defeated another Sena candidate, Santosh Singh, again by a respectable margin. In the Lok Sabha elections this year, Poonam Mahajan from the BJP had enjoyed a lead in the constituency, indicating a shift in choice.Though Khan is confident about his winning margin rising in the upcoming polls, anti-incumbency may make it tougher for him, said one of his supporters.For Khan, the long-pending rehabilitation plan of over 12,000 families living in the slums adjoining the international airport, will remain a priority if he wins. “It is also a security threat to the city. A couple of months ago, a person breached the airport security and entered the runway area after climbing the boundary wall. These slum residents need to be rehabilitated,” Khan told TOI. He said a building built for rehabilitating these residents is lying unused for over a decade. Residents of slums closer to Mithi river are awaiting rehabilitation too.Despite the largest voter base, the constituency does not have a government hospital. Sena’s Lande has not only promised a hospital, but also an open ground and wider roads. Some voters from Hiranandani and Chandivali highrises may choose Lande due to Shiv Sena’s alliance with BJP. MNS’ Sumeet Baraskar is likely to eat into some of the Marathi votes from Sena."

CHANDIGARH: Haryana constitutes just 2% of the country’s total population but has been contributing around 10% of the total strength of India’s armed forces. However, political parties have given a short shrift to military veterans in the assembly polls slated for October 21. Only six ex-servicemen have been fielded as candidates for the 90-seat state assembly.The state has around one lakh service voters, including members of military and paramilitary forces, who will exercise their franchise in the assembly polls. Around 2.84 lakh retired soldiers and 86,000 widows of former soldiers in the state add to the defence fraternity, making it a strong vote bank. Six Haryana districts — Rohtak, Jhajjar, Charkhi-Dadri, Bhiwani, Rewari and Gurgaon — form the hub of ex-servicemen and serving soldiers.The incumbent BJP has fielded sitting minister Captain Abhimanyu from Narnaund in Hisar and Congress has fielded Maj Nirpender Sangwan from Dadri and Ramkishan Fauji, a former Army jawan from Bawani Khera in Bhiwani district. Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) has fielded Fauji Ramesh Palri, an ex-serviceman from Mahendergarh seat, apart from dismissed BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav from Karnal. Swaraj India has also fielded former Indian Air Force officer Sanjeev Godara from Dadri assembly seat. INLD , which had fielded two ex-servicemen in Lok Sabha polls from Rohtak and Bhiwani, has not fielded any veteran in the state assembly polls.Captain Ajay Yadav, senior Congress leader who used to contest from Rewari, got his son Chiranjeev Rao, son-in-law of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, fielded as the Congress nominee from the constituency this time.According to political experts, such high number of defence sector electors in the state assembly will play a decisive role considering the close fight on some seats. It was only because of the clout of armed forces in the state, BJP had sent Lt Gen D P Vats, a noted ophthalmologist and former director and commandant of prestigious Armed Force Medical College Pune, to Rajya Sabha.The craze of Haryanvis for armed forces has also led the Union government to decide to set up one more Sainik School at Matanhail town of Jhajjar district in Haryana. Already two Sainik Schools are functioning in the state at Kujpura in Karnal and in Rewari. With the setting up of the third school, Haryana would become the country’s only state to have three such schools."

JALANDHAR: Even as SAD and BJP are praising each other in election meetings for the four assembly byelections in Punjab, there is growing apprehension among leaders of the two parties that the latest round of acrimonious statements by their top leaders against each other in Haryana would have some adverse impact in Punjab too.Both Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal made disparaging remarks against each other’s party on Sunday. At Kalanwali rally on Sunday, Khattar took a dig at Akalis, saying, “Akali Dal was desperately seeking an alliance with us. But we rejected it and clearly told them that we can’t have an alliance with them.”Explaining the reason for rejecting SAD overtures, he said, “We asked them to give us water through SYL canal and (said) ‘we shall give you 2-3 seats free’. Should we look out for our farmers or your (SAD) two-four seats. For us, our farmers are more important. Even if now SAD announces that it will not create hurdles, then barring Kalanwali, they should tell us one candidate fielded by them and we shall withdraw from there and help their candidate win.”Sukhbir, too, had adopted the same tenor while addressing public meetings in Haryana in support of INLD-SAD candidates. Claiming there was not much support for BJP in the state, he said, “A false perception has been created that there is a wave in favour of BJP. In Sirsa and Fatehabad, BJP cannot get even one seat. I checked from Rohtak, there also they have nothing.”Taking a dig at Khattar, he said CMs these days were made only due to waves. “Wave is for a different person and somebody else becomes a CM,” he said, implying that Khattar became CM because BJP won in Haryana in 2014 due to Modi wave. “When wave is not there, their chances also collapse,” he said.When TOI checked with some SAD and BJP leaders of Punjab, the common refrain was that fresh bitterness, just a week ahead of the polling, will have at least some adverse impact on bypolls. “Local leaders and even workers feel dejected and uncertain about future sustainability of the alliance in Punjab and it impacts their morale,” they said. They also revealed that both the parties were focusing on their own cadres in their respective seats.“The bitterness can also cast a shadow on the alliance during the 2022 (Punjab) assembly polls. When our party wants a bigger pie now and has also shown place to the SAD in Haryana,” said a BJP leader.However, Punjab BJP president Shwait Malik and SAD secretary and spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema denied that the bitterness of Haryana would have no impact in Punjab. “Our alliance is very strong in Punjab,” Malik said.Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday dared Sukhbir to clarify his party’s dual relations with BJP. “When you describe BJP as anti-farmer and anti-poor in Haryana, how can the party be termed as pro-farmer and pro-poor in Punjab,” he askedSAD candidate from Kalanwali, Ranjit Singh Desujodha was BJP candidate in 2014. After BJP won over SAD MLA Balkaur Singh and fielded him from Kalanwali on BJP ticket this time, it enraged Akalis and the party got Ranjit Singh in its fold to field him from Kalwanwali on its ticket. On Sunday, Khattar had attacked the SAD candidate and called him “nikamma banda” without naming him and called Balkaur Singh a gentleman."

GURGAON: Hitting out at Congress over its opposition to ""big decisions"" like Article 370 and triple talaq, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday dared the party to promise that it will undo these steps if elected to power.The PM, who was addressing the first of his four rallies in Haryana in Ballabgarh, accused Congress of blocking the path of progress, saying the party had lost touch with reality and was devoid of ideas. While BJP had a ""strong team and strong captain"" in Manohar Lal Khattar, Congress and other opposition parties were ""crumbling and desperately trying to keep their leadership together"", said Modi, and went on to highlight the welfare schemes of the central and Haryana governments.In a state that contributes significantly to the armed forces, Modi's speech was full of references to decisions like acquisition of fighter jets, one-rank-one-pension (OROP) and the surgical strikes, and stressed how the BJP was committed to strengthening national security. Campaigning for BJP's candidates from south Haryana, the PM said people had a clear choice - vote for a party weakening the security forces or one working to strengthen them.Modi said despite Congress' 'conspiracy' to cancel the Rafale fighter jet deal with France, BJP had remained committed to modernisation of the armed forces. ""There was a conspiracy to ensure that we do not get a modern fighter jet. But despite this, India got Rafale,"" said Modi.He further blamed Congress for delay in development of the light fighter HAL Tejas. ""I don't know what kind of pressure they were under to delay it. We gave wings to Tejas and now it is a proud member of our forces,"" said Modi. ""I will not allow our jawan to fight without ammunition and modern equipment. Jab tak Modi hai aisa nahi hoga,"" said the PM to loud cheers from the crowd.He also said arrears worth Rs 900 crore had been transferred to the account of beneficiaries from Haryana under OROP.Reminding people about the surgical strikes, Modi said while his government had given a free hand to the armed forces to deal strongly with terrorism, the previous Congress government had tied the hands of soldiers. ""So many persons from Haryana are in the army. Ask them what message they have from government,"" Modi told the crowd. "" Surgical strike yaad hai nai? (remember the surgical strikes?),"" he added, amplifying his point.On Article 370, the PM said India today was taking decisions which were unthinkable in the past. ""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of development. The credit does not go to Modi, it goes to the 130 crore people of this country. I derive strength from you, you gave us big mandate,"" he said.He hit out at Congress for 'seeking help from foreign countries', a reference to the meeting between representatives of the party's UK chapter with Britain's Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn ""These people... whose interests have been hurt... are questioning this decision, going abroad and asking for help. I am shocked by this,"" he said, adding, ""They are shedding crocodile tears. They don't have the courage to speak against it (Article 370) as people are with this decision.""Last week, Corbyn had tweeted a picture of his meeting with members of Indian Overseas Congress UK who, he said, discussed the "" human rights situation in Kashmir"".Congress, said Modi, had opposed triple talaq for its own political benefit. ""A large number of people, including many Muslim men, supported the bill. There was no voice of dissent after its passage,"" he said."

PUNE: Non-submission of election expenditure has placed 74 candidates from the 246 contesting in Pune district under the scanner.As many as 45 candidates have been issued notices for remaining absent for the checking of accounts while 29 others got notices for understatement of expenditure details in the first round of scrutiny, nodal officer Ajit Relekar said.Every candidate is allowed up to Rs 28 lakh as poll expenditure. All candidates must submit the incurred expenditure. If they do not respond to the notices in a time frame, they can be barred from contesting elections for three years.“Candidates can submit their say at a hearing or give the final expenditure within 30 days,’’ Relekar said.Candidates must have a separate account and file the election expenses with the ECI. All registered political parties have to submit a statement of their expenditure to the ECI within 90 days of the completion of the elections.An incorrect account of expenditure, beyond the cap, can lead to disqualification up to three years under section 10A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.Candidates have to submit the accounts within 20 days of receipt of the notice. The reply of the candidate and the comment of the respective DEO is considered by the Election Commission of India for a final decision.If the ECI is not satisfied, then under section 10 (A), the order is issued against the candidate, debarring him/ her from fighting an election for three years which is published in the gazette.Poll observers maintain that candidates spend much more than the Rs 28 lakh. They adjust their expenditure under party expenses as there is no cap.“They are supposed to submit the details as per the rate chart drawn up by the election department. If they give an understatement they can be put under scrutiny,’’ election officials said.A candidate said they are short of time and had to send a representative with the expenditure details and was issued a show-cause notice. “We have just a week left and did not have enough time to submit the details. We will be doing so shortly,’’ another candidate said.Vehicles during election campaign, campaigning equipment, election rallies, electronic and print media, banners, hoardings and pamphlets, field visits."

MUMBAI: With each election Maharashtra seems to be deepening its bond with dynastic culture. 'Netas' of all hues show no qualms in gifting nominations to their kith and kin.The 'beta-beti' bandwagon is trundling across at least nine assembly constituencies in the city. ""The mooning-swooning Papa-Mummies and a team of fawning attendants turn elections into a Bharatiya soap opera,"" said theatre person Vishwas Sohoni. ""The entire exercise is to perpetuate family rule in the party and safeguard political citadels,"" said writer-critic Meena Waishampayan.Topping the list of scions is Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray—the first resident of Matoshree to contest a poll and grandson of the late Balasaheb who, point out veteran Senaites, placed more emphasis on 'samajkaaran' (social awakening) than 'raajkaaran' (power politics).""Balasaheb had supreme disdain for electoral politics… he would deride democracy and say it only fanned greed, betrayal and factionalism. It was in the 1990s when the Sena began to expand its base in the wake of the Hindutva resurgence that Balasaheb thought of grooming Uddhavji as his political heir. Yet, Uddhavji never thought of contesting an election,"" said Yashwant Parab, a Sena sympathiser.Today, not many in Sena would take a leaf out of Balasaheb's book, said party watchers. The number of Sena functionaries eager to promote GenNext is rising. Environment minister Ramdas Kadam's son Yogesh is Sena candidate in Khed. Saamna executive editor and Sena MP Sanjay Raut's brother Sunil is contesting from Bhandup for a second term. BMC standing committee chief Yashwant Jadhav's wife Yamini is the Sena candidate from Byculla. In Bandra (E), it is Zeeshan, son of ex-minister and Congress leader Baba Siddique, who is the party's candidate.Vidya Thakur, wife of BJP functionary Jayaprakash Thakur, is also vying to retain her Goregaon pocketborough. Vidya was minister of state for food and civil supplies in the Fadnavis regime. Sunil Rane, BJP candidate from Borivli, is the son of Datta Rane, a senior party leader and minister in the 1990s.BJP has also offered a ticket to Rahul Narwekar from Colaba. A party hopper, Narwekar left NCP to join Sena before recently defecting to BJP. He is son-in-law of Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar, NCP leader and chairman of Maharashtra legislative council. Rahul's father was once a corporator from Colaba.'Betis' too are flaunting the family card with glee. Varsha Gaikwad, former minister and Congress candidate from Dharavi, is daughter of ex-party MP and Mumbai Congress committee chief Eknath Gaikwad. Geeta Gawli, Akhil Bharatiya Sena corporator and daughter of Arun Gawli, is the party's candidate in Byculla.Aditi Tatkare is NCP candidate from Shriwardhan in Raigad district, from where her father Sunil is the party MP. In Muktai Nagar, Jalgaon, BJP pacified party veteran Eknath Khadse, who was keen on joining the poll fray, by offering the candidature to his daughter Rohini.The initiation of the third generation of Pawars ran into rough weather as Partha, Ajit Pawar's son, lost the Lok Sabha poll from Mawal in May this year. This time around, Pawar has cleared the nomination of Rohit, grandson of the NCP president's eldest brother, from Baramati, the family's bastion in Pune district.Amit Dheeraj Deshmukh are also contesting from two seats in Latur, in Marathwada, to safeguard their fiefdom. They are the late Vilasrao Deshmukh's sons. Actor Riteish Deshmukh lent a dash of glamour to their campaign by sweating it out on Latur’s streets, prompting a Congressman to remark, 'Bhai ho toh aisa.'"

BALLABGARH (HARYANA): Launching a broadside against the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the opposition party to explain ""its love"" for Article 370 to the families of security personnel martyred in Jammu and Kashmir Addressing his first of four election rallies in Haryana this week, he said the opposition was shedding ""crocodile tears"" and challenged the Congress to tell people that it will rescind the Modi government's decision on J-K if voted to power.Modi also targeted the Congress over Rafale, saying he was happy that despite its best efforts to stall the deal, the country had received first of the fighter jets, and stressed that the BJP was committed to strengthening security forces.After it swept the Lok Sabha polls , the BJP has again made nationalism its major poll plank in upcoming assembly elections, which will be the first in the country after the Centre's decision to scrap special status to J-K on August 5.Asserting that India is now taking big decisions like on Article 370 which were unthinkable earlier, the Prime Minister said the massive mandate from the people gave him the strength to take the step which, he asserted, has the backing of the entire country including Haryana.Some people whose interests have been affected are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations, the Prime Minister said, while again targeting the opposition on the issue as he did in poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday.Modi said the opposition parties in Haryana were crumbling and their attempts to come together are falling apart, while the BJP had a ""strong team and a strong captain"" in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar ""India is taking big decisions, which no one could think of earlier. Which decision am I talking about? This decision on Article 370,"" he said.Modi said there was feeling in Haryana and the entire country that J&K needs to be pulled out of spiral of violence and put on path of development.""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of trust and development and credit for this does not go to Modi, but it goes to 130 crore people of this country and voters of this country. You gave us big mandate and I derive strength from you to realise your dreams,"" he said.Modi accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370.""The entire country is also seeing people whose interests have been affected by the decision on Article 370 are in a state of shock. These people are raising questions on this decision and seeking help in foreign nations.""""Those who are unable to sleep and 'j', if these people have so much liking for Article 370 and 35-A, then I challenge them why don't they muster courage and go before people of Haryana and tell them that if they win elections, they will bring back Article 370 and 35-A,"" Modi said.On Sunday, Khattar too had used a Hindi proverb """" to take a swipe at the Congress' three-month effort at choosing a president, drawing ire of the opposition party. The proverb suggests there was much ado about noting. Though literally, it means finding a mouse after digging a mountain.He said those opposing the decision know that Modi government got overwhelming public mandate and support because of which the Centre was able to take a decision on Article 370.He asked people to go to villages and make people understand the benefits of the step.Training guns on opposition, he said ""because of their love for Article 370 mothers lost their brave sons and young women were widowed"".""The brave jawan of Haryana who was protecting innocent citizens of J&K, who fell to bullet of terrorists and when his body came back wrapped in tricolour, ask those mothers how many sons-of-soil lost lives because of your love for Article 370... ask how many were widowed and how many children were orphaned,"" he said at the rally in the state which sends a large numbers of youths in security forces.""Those who lost their dear ones for peace in J&K, Congress leaders must tell them why they love Article 370 so much. They must tell in what way this Article benefited the state,"" he saidTaking a dig at Congress, Modi said, it should ""tell people that it will reverse what Modi has done. And when Lok Sabha elections come, mention in manifesto that they will reverse these decisions. Do they have the courage to say so?""He said the Dalit community in Jammu and Kashmir was deprived of decent jobs there. He said that wards of people belonging to 'Valmiki' community were never considered capable of other jobs than sweeping and toilet cleaning for four generations.Modi also accused the Congress of doing votebank politics over triple talaq issue, alleging the opposition parties made every kind of excuse to stall the law against triple talaq.""Congress and other parties like them stood like a wall in the way of each betterment and change you have seen,"" Modi alleged.A day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi again rake up the Rafale deal issue , the Prime Minister alleged that the opposition made their best efforts to ensure the agreement for fighter jets was cancelled.You remember, during Lok Sabha polls, how they made a hue and cry over the Rafale deal. They were beating their chests and made their best efforts to ensure that the agreement for Rafale was cancelled, he said.Modi said that he was happy that India had got its first Rafale aircraft.He said that it was not acceptable to him that country's soldiers become victims of the enemy in the absence of necessary arms and ammunition.Modi accused the previous Congress government of putting Tejas project, the home-built jet, on the back burner.""Don't know (it was done) under whose pressure. Our government has removed all the bottlenecks and gave wings to this project,"" he said.He said undertaking development and bringing change in people's lives has always been his priority.Modi praised Khattar, saying his team has taken Haryana to new heights of development.He said the more the opposition parties are trying to come together, the more they are falling apart.Modi began his address by saying the place is not far from here where during Emergency days former Prime Minister Morarji Desai was arrested and put behind bars for 19 months.Seeking to strike an emotional chord, he said, ""When I am amongst you, when I come to Haryana, I always feel like I am coming to my home. Haryana taught me a lot...""In Video: Jawans lost their lives because of Congress' 'love' for Article 370: PM Narendra Modi"

PUNE: Campaigning for the BJP for the October 21 Maharashtra assembly elections , Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for removing special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 , a move he described as the ""final nail in the coffin of terrorism "".Addressing a public rally in Lonavla in Pune district in support of BJP candidate Sanjay Bhegde, Adityanath said that by nullifying Article 370 Modi turned the idea of ""One nation, great nation"" into reality.""Kashmir, which is called as paradise on the Earth, turned into hell under Article 370. Terrorists used to kill innocent civilians and Indian soldiers,"" he said, adding that the withdrawn provision was a major impediment in development of Jammu and Kashmir.The chief minister also said that it was Syama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the BJP's forerunner Jana Sangha, who had staunchly opposed the idea of ""two prime ministers, two signs, and two Constitutions"" under Article 370.""The idea of 'one nation, great nation' became a reality thanks to Narendra Modiji and (Union home minister) Amit Shah . With this decision, the final nail was put in the coffin of terrorism. The move has sent the message that terrorism has no place on the Indian soil,"" he said.Adityanath also praised Modi government for working for the cause of the empowerment of women, which he said was previously restricted only to ""slogans"". He listed schemes like '', '', and the law to criminalise triple talaq to make his point.He said his Maharashtra counterpart Devendra Fadnavis, who is seeking a second term, has ""transformed"" the lives of people by implementing several welfare projects.""Gone are the days when thousands of farmers used to commit suicide. The Fadnavis government has not only stopped suicides by launching pro-farmer schemes, but also generated employment opportunities for people,"" he added.Adityanath said Fadnavis government broke the back of crime in the state.""There was time when goons of the 'D' (Dawood Ibrahim) gang used to extort money; bomb blasts occurred, but in the last five years all these elements have disappeared and a secure atmosphere prevailed in Maharashtra,"" he said.The assembly polls are scheduled to be held on October 21. Counting of votes will take place on October 24.Nullification of Article 370 has become a focal point of the BJP's electoral discourse, drawing allegations from the Opposition camp that the saffron top brass is skirting core issues like ""economic downturn"" to ""divert"" attention of voters."

NEW DELHI: Former director general (DG) of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) BB Lal and three others linked to the project have said KK Muhammed was part of the team that excavated the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya in 1976-77.“It is a fact that Shri KK Muhammed was there with me when I was excavating the Ram Janmabhoomi area in Ayodhya,” Lal, 98, told TOI in an email.This was in response to a letter by Syed Ali Rizvi, chairman, department of history, Aligarh Muslim University, published in TOI on October 12, in which Rizvi said Muhammed was never part of BB Lal's team. Rizvi was responding to an interview ‘There is no doubt that a temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu existed below Babri Masjid ’, in which Muhammed had told TOI that he was the only Muslim archaeologist in the team led by BB Lal which had excavated the Ram Janmabhoomi site in 1976-77.Rizvi countered Muhammed’s claims by saying that the latter’s name did not occur anywhere in the reports filed by BB Lal himself and published in the ASI Annual Reports.However, apart from KK Muhammed himself, Lal and at least three other members of the team have refuted Rizvi’s rebuttal.Ramakant Chaturvedi, who retired as director of Municipal Museum, Gwalior in 2007, said Muhammed had participated in the excavation at Ayodhya in 1976-77 as a trainee. “Muhammed was a student of ASI’s School of Archaeology at Delhi. He was with me,” he said.Giving details of the excavations, Chaturvedi, 75, said they were carried out under a project called Archaeology of Ramayan Sites. The project was led by BB Lal, who was the ASI DG from 1968 to 1972 and director of Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, Shimla.Rajnath Kaw, who retired as ASI’s chief photographer in 2005, claimed that Muhammed was not just a part of Lal’s excavation team but also the only Muslim in it. On Muhammed’s name not figuring in the ASI’s Annual Reports, he said it was because the names of the trainees were not included in them but only those of the members of the project.He said Muhammed was a student of the School of Archaeology, which later was renamed Institute of Archaeology and shifted from Delhi to Greater Noida.Ashok Pandey, who retired in 2016 as superintending archaeologist at Bhopal, was Muhammed’s classmate in School of Archaeology. He said Muhammed and 10 other students of the school were part of the team which took part in the excavation at Ayodhya in 1976-77.He said School of Archaeology would admit about 12 candidates for a one-year post-graduate (PG) diploma course in archaeology every year. The classes would commence in September-October. These students would be sent by ASI for two-month training in excavation between December and February every year as excavations generally take place in the winters, he said.Pandey, 63, said it was during this part of the training that they had joined BB Lal for excavation at Ayodhya."

BALLABGARH (HARYANA): Asserting that India is now taking big decisions like on Article 370 which were unthinkable earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the massive mandate given by the people gave him the strength to take the step and challenged the opposition Congress to publicly state that it will restore the provision if voted to power.Addressing his first of four election rallies in Haryana this week, Modi said the opposition parties in the state were crumbling and their attempts to come together are falling apart, while the BJP had a ""strong team and a strong captain"" in chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar The prime minister again targeted the opposition on the issue of abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir as he did in poll-bound Maharashtra on Sunday.""India is taking big decisions, which no one could think of earlier. Which decision am I talking about? This decision is of Article 370. ""J&K and Ladakh are moving on path of trust and development and credit for this does not go to Modi, but it goes to 130 crore people of this country. I derive strength from you, you gave us big mandate,"" he said.Modi accused the opposition parties of politicising the issue of Article 370.""I challenge them that if Article 370 is so dear to you, you go among the people and tell them that you will reverse the Centre's decision,"" he said."

RATNAGIRI/SINDHDURG: Mumbai has an emotional hold over the Konkan districts, a hold that for decades has allowed the Shiv Sena to hold sway in Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg.“Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg are a tiny strip from the Sahyadris to the Arabian Sea. Its soil does not hold water. No matter how intense the rains it drains into the sea within an hour. So there is no largescale agriculture and no industries. People have to go out for employment,” says Pravin Waghchoure, vice-principal, Govindrao Nikam College of Pharmacy, Chiplun Generations of Konkan residents have flocked to Mumbai in search of livelihood. And the Shiv Sena has played a part by providing patronage in the form of opportunities and protection. The goodwill in Mumbai was, in turn, encashed in the Konkan during elections.But with unemployment rising and a dearth of jobs, this influence has been waning for some time. “There are no jobs locally as well and Sena has been opposing projects in the region for they are polluting,” said Rajan Chavan, a local journalist.The Sena is also viewed as opportunist. “The 15 villages affected by the Nanar refinery project are not convinced about the Sena’s opposition to the project. People will decide who they wish to vote for,” said N D Kulkarni of the Kokan Refinery Virodhi Sangharsh Sanghatana.The BJP is looking to capitalise on the unrest and sees the alignment with former Sena strongman Narayan Rane as an opportunity. This has led to a unique situation in Sindhdurg: Sena and BJP have put up candidates against each other on all three seats.While BJP is riding piggyback on Rane who is keen to join the party, Sena is at loggerheads with him. BJP has been nervous about formally inducting Rane into its fold though his son Nitesh is contesting from Kankavli in Sindhdurg district on a BJP ticket.The objective is to finish Rane politically, says candidate after candidate of the Sena. At a rally in Chiplun, industry minister Subhash Desai declared that the Sena had defeated him four times and will do so again.On the other hand, BJP district president Pramod Jathar paints a rosy picture for party workers at a meet near Kankavli. “The Mahajanadesh (yatra organised by Devendra Fadnavis) saw huge crowds now that Rane has joined us. We will win the assembly polls, and immediately thereafter are the zilla parishad and gram panchayat elections, which too we shall win. And the development cooperative bank will be controlled by us. There will be a sugar cooperative and development.” For decades, Jathar was at odds with Rane, but now he has reconciled and is actively campaigning for Rane’s son and BJP candidate Nitesh.Rane, too, has mellowed. “My fight is with no one. My fight is not with the Sena, it is against those who are fighting the elections. I want no bitterness during the elections,” he said. The BJP, he said, will formally induct him into the party at a public rally here on October 15 to be addressed by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Article 370 finds no resonance here. Unemployment is the most serious issue and the Sena, which in earlier years ensured jobs in Mumbai, is now offering solutions locally.“We are aggressively promoting farming on small cooperative basis,” said sitting MLA and Sena candidate from Kudal Vaibhav Naik. Satish Sawant, the Sena candidate from Kankavli and a former associate of Rane, is offering small dams and non- polluting industries as a solution.In this duel, the Congress is nowhere in the picture. Shekhar Nikam of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is hopeful of winning the Chiplun seat while Bhaskar Jadhav who recently switched to Sena brushes aside any talk of local Sainiks sabotaging his chances.Raigad NCP MP Sunil Tatkare said his party is at least putting up a fight unlike Congress. “If they (Congress) were to only focus on a seat, they could actually win seats,” he said."

As a psephologist, Yogendra Yadav always spoke with candour. Now on the other side, as head of a political party that is making its debut in the Haryana assembly polls, he speaks with characteristic frankness on why he does not want to call this an , the implosion of the opposition, and his party’s primary objective (which is not winning). Excerpts from a conversation with Joel JosephThe decision to contest was taken around six months ago, around the same time when we decided not to contest the Lok Sabha elections. We took a conscious decision and kept away from the Lok Sabha field as we did not want to be seen as a distracting force because at stake was the future of Indian democracy. However, after the Lok Sabha result, we decided to contest the Haryana elections because we strongly felt there was a genuine need to build and provide an alternative. The very idea of India is at stake. In fact, I would not even call this an election, which is about issues. This is a plebiscite, about big leaders. The present opposition is in no shape to put up a resistance. Participation in the Haryana elections is a small step in the direction to provide an alternative.Finding the right candidates was no less than a search operation for us. In fact, we had to approach potential candidates. It wasn’t the other way round. In other parties, one can find many political entrepreneurs, but this is not in our case. We set a standard of 5Cs — character, corruption, caste, communality and communalism. We would have wanted to contest all 90 seats but had to restrict ourselves to just 27 candidates as finding the right candidates who clear the 5Cs are few. In fact, we had announced we will give a third of seats to women and youth and while we have 11 youths out of the 27 candidates, I am ashamed to say we have only five women candidates. But there is good reason for this. We did not want just bahu, beti. We wanted those women who are not proxy candidates.Probably, the voters did not find me viable, and visible among candidates likely to win. This election is not about winning, we are here for a long run. We are the only party which has managed to make unemployment an election issue. In fact, for the first time in India and Haryana, we have presented a blueprint to the voters about our plan of action, the expenditure required and the source of revenue, while rest of the parties promise the moon.Article 370 by itself is not an issue, but BJP wants us to believe it is because its record in the last five years is so poor that there is nothing else to talk about. The astonishing thing is that despite its poor track record in governance, this government is presenting itself to people, seeking a second term. There has been a meltdown of law and order across the state on three major occasions.The fact is, Haryana is number one in unemployment rate in the country right now. If we talk about farmers, the rate of procurement of bajra was 4% in 2017 and 26% in 2016. If local issues played a role, there is no chance Manohar Lal Khattar will be re-elected. Either the local issues just don’t matter or people are unable to see a credible alternative.Fragmentation of farmer votes is the real tragedy of Haryana. Haryana traditionally has been a farmers’ vote bank. The tragedy is not about the split in the Chautala family, but that in all this, the farmers have become property dispute. The split has left the legacy of farmers in tatters. This is music to the ears of BJP. A bit of this fragmentation might go to Congress as well.We have given tickets to our candidates for five years. The objective is to see whether we have succeeded in raising the right issues, if we have created a new and positive agenda, and whether we are gathering the right energy in society and making future leaders. Anything above this is a bonus for me.Speaking as a psephologist and not Swaraj India founder, who would you say is forming the next government in Haryana?We certainly aren’t. As I keeping saying, ‘pehle bhavishya batata tha, ab bhavishya banata hoon’ (I predicted the future earlier, I make the future now)."

PUNE: Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday said revoking special status to Jammu and Kashmir was an important issue with a nationwide impact and defended making it a poll issue for the state assembly elections.Prasad's comments come in the backdrop of remarks by the opposition that the issue had nothing to do with the elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.""Do the citizens of Maharashtra have no concerns about situation in J&K? J&K is part of the country,"" he said at a press conference on Sunday.He added that the situation in J&K improved after Article 370 was repealed. ""Article 370 had become an instrument of secessionism and separatism. Why should the issue not be raised (for the state polls)?"" he said.Prasad said the Centre was making efforts to turn Pune into a smart city and, when pressed on the lack of significant impact of big ticket projects such as riverfront development and Smart Cities Mission , he said the results will take time. ""It takes time for changes to reflect. We are buliding a centre of excellence here to infuse IT in the auto sector. We want to raise Pune's IT profile"" he said.Prasad said his comments about box office collections of Bollywood movies were blown out of the proportion. ""I have already withdrawn that statement,"" he said."

MUMBAI: MNS president Raj Thackeray on Sunday slammed the Centre for harping on Article 370 when the country is passing through a grave financial crisis.""Nearly two crore people have lost jobs, industries have downed shutters and banks are collapsing. The Modi government has miserably failed to tackle the escalating economic crisis. Hence, it keeps harping on Article 370 and J&K to whip up emotions,"" alleged Thackeray.What use is there for Article 370 for Maharashtra which faces economic slowdown, loss of employment and natural calamities? But, those in power are whipping up emotional issues to sidestep key issues of development,"" he said.The Centre's plan to start a Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train was a drain on resources, he said and added that ongoing trains from Mumbai to Ahmedabad were running on a mere 48% booking.Thackeray hit out at the Centre for leaving depositors of the Punjab Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMCB) high and dry. ""The PMCB depositors have lost the savings of their lives. However, the Centre says the RBI will take a call, while the RBI has refused to take the depositors' responsibility,"" said Thackeray. He was addressing a party rally at Magathane in Borivli which has a large percentage of the PMCB depositors.Thackeray lambasted the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena government for lack of good governance in the state."

AURANGABAD: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday hit out at BJP, saying it was diverting public attention from real issues by invoking the nullification of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir and India's Moon mission.""While campaigning in Maharashtra, PM Narendra Modi and (Union home minister) Amit Shah are not uttering a single word on real issues. They are instead trying to take political mileage out of the nullification of Article 370 and Isro's efforts. The ruling party leaders are unmindful of the fact that public anger is mounting due to core issues such as agricultural distress and unemployment,"" he said.Rahul kickstarted his poll campaign for the assembly elections in the state from Ausa in Latur. At the start of his address, Rahul took a dig at BJP for its 2014 poll slogan by asking the audience if ""acche din"" had arrived. ""Has unemployment affected you? Have farmers received good returns for their agricultural yield? Have loans of farmers been waived?"" he said to a large audience that had gathered in the hot and humid weather.Referring to the current economic slowdown, the former Congress chief said it was just the beginning of the ""disaster"" ahead.

JALGAON/SAKOLI (MAHARASHTRA): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched his poll blitz in Maharashtra by daring the opposition parties to declare in their manifestos for the assembly elections - and all future polls - that they would roll back the nullification of Article 370 and scrap the triple talaq law.Addressing a rally at Jalgaon in north Maharashtra, Modi put J&K and Ladakh at the heart of his speech to articulate how NDA was going full steam ahead with ""extraordinary"" decisions while the opposition was just being a stumbling block.""We have made a new beginning (in Kashmir) that will usher in development and fulfil the aspirations of the local people. J&K and Ladakh aren't just about a piece of land within India, together they are its crown,"" he said. ""This year, on August 5, our government took an extraordinary decision to nullify Article 370. Our opposition could not even think of this when they were in power. They are now unable to digest our decision. As a result, they have been making remarks on the issue that are only delighting our neighbour.""Modi then threw what he described as ""an open challenge"" to the opposition - to make a commitment in their manifestos to undo what NDA had done. ""But they will not do so, as they know that the people of the country have hailed our decision and will not spare anyone who tries to bring back Article 370. The opposition must stop shedding crocodile tears on this,"" he said.The PM also accused the opposition of trying to block the triple talaq law. ""The opposition parties, led by Congress, tried to create hurdles to prevent the passage of the triple talaq bill because they did not want Muslim women to benefit. If they have the guts, let them publicly announce that they will do away with this law if they come to power. But they wouldn't do so, as they are also convinced that the law not only benefits Muslim women but also men of the community,"" he said.On the Congress-NCP alliance, Modi said the two were a ""tired lot"". ""They have come together, but they are incapable of fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Maharashtra.""At Sakoli in Bhandara, his second rally of the day, the PM urged people of the state to ensure a ""historic mandate"" for the BJP-Shiv Sena combine.Unlike in Jalgaon, he didn't mention J&K once. He had started his speech in Marathi, saying, ""I thank the people of Maharashtra for their support in the LS polls. I had addressed a public meeting in Gondia before that election. The result proved all political pundits wrong. The result of this assembly election is known beforehand.""In Video: Jalgaon rally: PM Narendra Modi dares opposition to declare bringing back Article 370 in their election manifesto"

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday accused the BJP-led government of monumental mismanagement of the economy, saying it has moved from "" recession to crisis mode"" and the fiscal deficit was far more than the estimates.Addressing a press conference here, party leader Anand Sharma said the government in its second term was expected to address problems of agrarian distress and give a boost to the economy but there has been a crash in production, the collapse of demand and huge number of layoffs.He said sectors passenger vehicle sales had come down by 23.7 per cent in September.""Capital goods formation, if it was hovering around zero for the most part of this government, now it has collapsed and is the lowest since 2012. The manufacturing has hit a five-year low. There is a contraction in industrial output. It is minus 1.1 per cent,"" he said.Sharma said capacity utilisation of factories was not above 60 per cent, which has led to a large number of retrenchments in sectors such as auto, textiles and leather which are all labour intensive.He said the auto ancillary sector, where India is a global leader, has also been badly hit.""Not only the numbers are shocking but we know the government has failed to deliver despite fall in commodity prices since 2014. The windfall gain of this government only from petroleum products has been more than 2.6 lakh crores per annum,"" he said.Sharma said if about Rs 10 lakh crore of GST refunds , refund to exporters and unpaid bills of PSUs are added than ""fiscal deficit is not 3.3 per cent it is beyond 8 per cent"".He said direct and indirect collections were nowhere near the half-way mark.""The government is guilty of monumental mismanagement of Indian economy. We are staring at a huge revenue shortfall. Where will the GST come when factories are shutting down and production has been scaled down by factories. When you have complete collapse of all four engines of Indian economy, we can only term it as a crisis,"" he said.Sharma said the credit flow to the commercial sector has come down by 88 per cent.""It is unheard of in Independent India. Then you have bank frauds ,"" he said."

""In Panchkula, money was wasted on entry gates and roundabouts. During Congress rule, Haryana was number 1, but BJP pushed Haryana backwards by many years,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Chander Mohan met Congress media coordinator Mukesh Bassi at his residence in Sector 8 and discussed the election strategy.Talking to mediapersons, Bassi said he was here to support his childhood friend and Congress was certainly going to win from Panchkula.

AURANGABAD: “Dhiraj bhaiya cha haat bahari, tyanche kaam bhari, dusrya ummedvarala visrun ja. Apla Dhirajach lai bhari!” (Dhiraj holds a firm position, his work is great, forget other candidates. Dhiraj is the best)Actor-producer Riteish Deshmukh used a dialogue from his popular film to camapaign for his younger brother Dhiraj, who is contesting the assembly election from Latur rural constituency. The son of former chief minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh , has plunged into election campaign mode for his two brothers, who are contesting from adjoining seats in Latur district.Riteish has been drawing huge crowd for his brothers, both Congress party nominees. Riteish’s elder brother Amit is seeking a third term from Latur city, where he faces BJP’s Shailesh Lahoti and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi nominee Raja Maniyar. Dhiraj is pitted against Shiv Sena candidate Sachin Deshmukh.Riteish, his actor wife Genelia and mother Vaishali had joined Amit and Dhiraj and their wives, when the two went to file their nominations. During the campaign, they have been invoking memories of the late chief minister while seeking people’s support. Riteish alone has addressed at least half a dozen rallies in the two constituencies so far and expected to hold a few more for Amit.Addressing a rally in Latur later, Riteish said, “I am from Latur, from Marathwada. I was born here and will die here. We had a tradition of going to the Mahadev Mandir before saheb (Vilasrao) went to file the nomination. Today, we continued the same tradition...You have made Amit bhaiyya... he is capable. He could get the chance to lead in the future. Now is the time to create another leadership in Dhiraj bhaiyya.”At another rally, Riteish urged voters to ensure that the highest lead in the state is from Latur rural constituency. “Amit bhaiyya is working.

NASHIK: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said he has “politically troubled” Sharad Pawar to such an extent that the NCP chief thought “every Nagpurkar is a goon”.While addressing a rally in Wardha on Thursday, Pawar had said Nagpur was now known as the “crime city” of Maharashtra “Pawar’s problem is that I have politically troubled him so much that he has started thinking that every Nagpurkar is a goon. It is because of the blessings of the state’s people that a common man from Nagpur has become the chief minister of Maharashtra,” Fadnavis said while addressing BJP poll rallies in Kopergaon and Karjat-Jamkhed in Ahmednagar district.Fadnavis said half of the NCP leaders have already deserted Pawar before the elections and the rest would follow suit after the declaration of the poll results.The CM described the NCP chief’s grand nephew, Rohit Pawar, as “a parcel” and told the voters of the Karjat-Jamkhed assembly segment to send him back “where he belongs to”.The NCP has pitched Rohit Pawar, who is from Pune, against BJP minister Ram Shinde for the Jamked-Karjat assembly constituency. “I am sure the voters of Jamked-Karjat will ensure what happened in Maval during the Lok Sabha elections,” Fadnavis said.Parth Pawar, another grand-nephew of the NCP chief, had faced a defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in Maval constituency against incumbent Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Barne.Fadnavis also alleged that some forces were threatening the sugar cane farmers of not accepting their produce if they were not voted to power.“In democracy, there is no room for threats to garner votes. One has to win the voters’ heart,” the CM said, claiming that both the Union and the state governments have done a lot work to improve the sugar industry in Maharashtra."

BEED: When the long arid spell scorched his soyabean field, 38-year-old Sudhakar Kadam did not have the strength to carry on. Already struggling with a Rs 2-lakh loan taken to dig a well, the farmer was left with nothing to fall back on. He hung himself in his field in Patoda's Saundana village on August 28.His widow Vimal has become a farm labourer, often joined by her three children. ""Sometimes when I miss school for 2-3 days, I lose track of what has been taught,"" says her 13-year-old daughter Pallavi.Across the driest districts in Marathwada , which was overlooked by the plentiful monsoon this year, distress is palpable. The belt has suffered three droughts in the last five years. This year, the rainfall was only 73% of normal with Beed, Latur and Osmanabad districts the worst affected.Till the end of September, Marathwada had witnessed 656 farmer suicides. Across Beed district, the soyabean and cotton crop is stunted and farmers cannot even hope for half their regular yield. Many like Akash Gundre in Ambajogai have not received the state government's farm loan waiver or crop loan. He plans to quit farming and work as a labourer. ""I cannot afford another year of losses,"" he says.Yet the unrelenting crisis here may not translate into an electoral setback for the ruling parties. The endemic distress in the region has been cushioned by the delivery of Central schemes aimed at providing crop insurance, toilets and housing. The lack of a strong campaign by the Opposition has also left voters floundering for options.In Naigaum village, BJP's campaign pitch on scrapping Article 370 draws mixed reactions. ""How does Kashmir affect our lives?"" asks a cynical Vidya Rudraksh from Ambajogai. But farmers say the payouts they have received from the crop insurance scheme after the 2018 drought have given them some hope. Beed district received payouts worth Rs 1,300 crore for last year's kharif crop, according to the district collector's office.Alif Patna, who spent Rs 500 for crop insurance last year, received Rs 9,000 for his 9-acre field. More prosperous farmers like Manish Rudraksh who bought higher insurance have drawn greater benefits. Rudraskh spent Rs 8,000 on crop insurance for his 20-acre field and received a payout of over Rs 1 lakh.In Shirur village, Sunita Ingale's family knows their field will get barely any yield this year but she is happy with the toilet they have built with the Rs 12,000 subsidy they received under the Centre's Swachch Bharat scheme. ""The toilet does not work through the year. We use it when there is water but at least at that time, women don't have to relieve themselves in the fields,"" says Sunita.The rural housing scheme has also found resonance among the villagers of Shirur. Bhimrao Ingale lives in a mud hut. He and his brother have been sanctioned a house under the Prime Minister's Awas Yojana, which entitles them to a subsidy of Rs 1.5 lakh. The delivery of Central schemes is a reason why on the ground, the image of Prime Minister Modi is stronger than that of the state government.There are many, however, who have not received anything from the government. In Patoda, an irate Rukmini Ankush Kadam says she will boycott the elections. ""We have not received money for a house, toilet or even gas from the government. Why should I vote for them?"" she asks bitterly. Yet for farmers like Akash Gundre, even the hope of receiving a payout is enough. ""I did not receive anything from the government but others did. Maybe in the future, I will too,"" he says."

MUMBAI: Sixty-one-year-old former Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress politician Avinash Pande has taken over the reins of the Congress war room in the city to take on the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the upcoming assembly election. The Nagpur-based Pande is credited with dislodging the Vasundhara Raje government of the BJP in Rajasthan.""A high-level team of Congress activists worked round-the-clock in Rajasthan,"" Pande said. ""We were able to convince the people of Rajasthan that it was high time for the dismissal of the BJP-led government. Our strategy worked out successfully, we wrested power from the BJP. For Maharashtra, we have drafted a separate plan. We have less than a fortnight but we are confident the Congress-NCP will wrest power from the saffron combine.""He said the party would convince the people through the war room volunteers that the BJP-led government of CM Devendra Fadnavis had failed to contain inflation, unemployment, the agrarian crisis and farmer suicides.Pande said senior politicians led by Rahul Gandhi and politicians from Congress-ruled Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh, and from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP and New Delhi will join the campaign. ""We expect CMs of most of the Congress-ruled states as well as prominent leaders of other states to join in to dislodge the Fadnavis government. We have appointed at least two observers, one from the state and one from outside, for each assembly constituency,"" he said.MP politician Jyotiraditya Scindia will address more than a dozen election rallies, mostly in Vidarbha, Marathwada and Mumbai region, on October 16, 17 and 18. Scindia was the head of the screening committee of the MPCC.Pande said the war room was being managed by over 350 highly educated Congress activists. ""War room activists will coordinate the campaign in all the constituencies allotted to the Congress. They will be involved in booth level management, effective use of information technology. They will interact with party observers for each constituency, monitor cases of violation of code of conduct by rivals, coordinate with state chief electoral officer and the EC, and take care of coordination of VVIP and VIP visits across the state,"" Pande said.Another task is social media. ""We will use newer methods to use social media for voter awareness,"" he said."

CHANDIGARH: At a time when Congress is striving to regain its lost ground in the state, former Haryana deputy chief minister Chander Mohan Bishnoi is also facing a 'now or never' like situation.Chander Mohan is locked in an electoral battle with Gian Chand Gupta, the chief whip and BJP candidate from Panchkula assembly seat. The constituency has got 2.8 lakh strong electorate. Chander Mohan's entry into the poll fray has made it tougher for BJP's Gian Chand Gupta who is seeking a re-election from Panchkula. The Congress leader is mainly banking on the contribution of his family as well as his late father and former CM Bhajan Lal for the growth of Panchkula that happened almost two decades back.On the other hand, Gupta is banking on the projects incepted over a period of the past five years. Besides, BJP is also hopeful of a positive result in view of the past Chander Mohan-Fiza controversy as well as factionalism in the Congress.In his mid-50s, Chander Mohan had made his debut in politics in 1993 when he fought a byelection from Kalka assembly constituency. The seat had got vacated following the death of Purush Bhan, the then MLA. Bhajan Lal was chief minister and he fielded Chander Mohan amid protests from Congressmen. ""Panchkula was the first such district of the country which had been carved out of a sub-division in 1995. That was the time when Panchkula was treated as a future capital and a roadmap to shift all headquarters was prepared. In fact, Bhajan Lal laid the foundation of modern Panchkula,"" said former MC president and Chander Mohan's confidante Ravinder Rawal. Rawal said Bhajan Lal and Chander Mohan were the architects of Panchkula and its growth so far. ""That (Fiza) episode was a bad phase of his life. But he did no wrong to anybody in the constituency. He remained accessible all the time,"" he said. Notably, Chander Mohan was last elected from Kalka in 2005 assembly elections. In 2009, he was denied a ticket and Devender Bansal was elected from Panchkula. But Bansal lost the seat to Gian Chand Gupta in 2014.Gupta and his team count construction of a ROB in Sector 19, house tax relaxation and Rs 2,000-crore development works during the BJP rule as their strength.""We have RTI queries of development between the Year 2004 to 2014. Panchkula was ranked second lowest when it came to development works in the state. They just laid the foundation stones and never bothered to take follow-up action,"" said former MC vice-president and Panchkula mandal president B B Singhal, who is also an election agent of Gupta."

NEW DELHI: The infighting in the faction-ridden Delhi Congress is out in the open. Almost three months after Sheila Dikshit’s death, her son and former MP Sandeep Dikshit has written to the party’s Delhi in-charge, P C Chacko, allegedly blaming him for her sudden demise and demanding an apology.While Chacko and Dikshit refused to reveal the letter’s contents, some Congress leaders said Dikshit was “really saddened” by the way Sheila was treated when she was making “organisational changes” in the state unit.Demand for sacking Chacko: Matter now with disciplinary committeeAt a hurriedly called press conference after the letter’s purported contents were reported in the media, some Delhi Congress leaders blamed Chacko for leaking a personal letter written to him by Dikshit and demanded his immediate removal from the party post and an inquiry against him.Another section questioned the timing of the letter, saying it would have carried weight had Dikshit written it earlier.Dikshit told reporters that it was a “personal letter” written by him to Chacko. “It’s a personal letter to Chacko. If Chacko wants to leak it and talk about it, it is his prerogative,” he said.Chacko confirmed that he had received a letter from Dikshit two days ago and had forwarded it to the interim party president Sonia Gandhi. “He has made some wild and nasty allegations against me. I have forwarded the letter to the party president,” Chacko said.Sources said Sonia Gandhi has now referred the matter to the party’s disciplinary committee. She had also called Sandeep Dikshit for a discussion.After Sheila’s sudden demise in July this year, Dikshit, a two-term Congress MP from East Delhi, had openly blamed AICC general secretary Chacko. Sheila, who was Delhi Congress president during the last Lok Sabha polls, didn’t agree with Chacko on many issues related to party matters.A section of Delhi Congress leaders close to Sheila had also claimed that the former chief minister had written a detailed letter to Sonia, just a day before her death, giving details of how she was being “constantly harassed” by Chacko and how her political decisions were being overturned by Chacko. But the letter never came into the public domain.At a press conference on Friday, party leaders Mangat Ram Singhal, Kiran Walia and Delhi Congress spokespersons Ramakant Goswami and Jitender Kochar also levelled allegations of corruption against Chacko and demanded that Sonia form a committee to probe the matter.“The letter was leaked by Chacko who claimed that it was a political letter. He should resign or the party high command should sack him. We also demand formation of a committee to probe his role as AICC in-charge of Delhi Congress,” Singhal said.Chacko has already urged the party leadership to relieve him from his post, saying he wants to focus on his home state, Kerala."

NEW DELHI: Resentment in Congress is running deep against the functioning of Indian Overseas Congress and Sam Pitroda after the controversy over a delegation’s meeting with the Labour chief in London put the AICC in a tight spot.If James Corbyn’s tweet created a controversy which was fanned by the ruling BJP, Congress had to engage in an elaborate exchange with the Labour brass to clarify the situation and come out of the mess.Congress insiders are seething at the unseemly sight of the party having to reiterate its stand that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal affair of India.At the root of the political embarrassment is the virtual autonomy that IOC has come to enjoy over last couple of years, with Sam Pitroda being close to Rahul Gandhi, as a family friend as well as a sounding board.If the IOC’s alleged discussion on Kashmir with the Labour chief came to light because of the tweet put out by James Corbyn, many are relieved that the spectacle around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the US eclipsed the protests held in New York. Besides two Pakistani groups, there was presence of IOC members among the protesters in the US city, a source said. “We barely got out of it,” he remarked.Congress circles argue that much as the party is vocal and aggressive in its opposition of Modi’s politics, it does not approve of dragging it abroad or fighting domestic issues on foreign land.“We have never done it. That red line has to be accepted,” sources said.According to Congress leaders, IOC was always an “affiliate” of the AICC which took orders from its “foreign affairs department”. Even now, when it is enjoying considerable latitude because of its chairman’s proximity to the party leadership, its mandate is still limited “to working among the diaspora” and it cannot “undertake independent action” on any issue.While the IOC claimed that in its meeting with Corbyn, it condemned the resolution on Kashmir passed at the recent Labour convention, there is still concern in the AICC that the Labour has not issued a statement backing the IOC. That, it is felt, leaves a hole.Many believe that Congress would have to rein in the IOC under Pitroda to avoid pitfalls in future.Though a technocrat credited with telecom revolution in India, Pitroda enjoyed a high profile during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But he triggered a major fracas with his comment “hua to hua” about the 1984 Sikh riots. The remark gave ruling BJP a major issue to target Congress, forcing Rahul Gandhi to censure Pitroda during the election campaign.Now again, the London meeting has given BJP a campaign plank against Congress in the ongoing assembly elections."

BHOPAL: Infighting in Madhya Pradesh Congress escalated on Friday with two party colleagues of chief minister Kamal Nath criticising his administration.While former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia alleged in Bhind that the state government has not fulfilled its promise of waiving farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh, former CM Digvijaya Singh asked Nath to take prompt action to clear roads of stray cattle saying they were dying in accidents.Addressing a party workers' meet in Bhind, Scindia said, ""Farmers' loans have not been waived in totality. Only loans of 50,000 have been waived whereas we had promised that loans up to 2 lakh will be written off.""Scindia's statement stunned party leaders with MP minister Sajjan Singh Verma saying that instead of giving statements, the former should directly speak to the CM on the issue. ""He speaks directly to AICC president Sonia Gandhi, so he can also speak to chief minister Kamal Nath,"" he said. ""Loans up to Rs 50,000 of 21 lakh farmers have been waived. The second list of 12.5 lakh farmers, who took loans from cooperative banks, is being prepared and in the third list loans of all remaining farmers who applied for waiver will be waived,"" the minister added.While Scindia was firing his salvo, a poster sprung up in Bhind showing the Congress leader with PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, and thanking him for his support to the nullification of Article 370. Installed by BJP worker Hridesh Sharma, district president of 'Bharat Raksha Manch', the poster hailed Scindia as ""great son of India"" and ""pride of Gwalior-Chambal"". The manch is headed by former BJP MP Raghunandan Sharma.Reacting to Scindia's attack on his party leader, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, ""Neither Shivraj nor the public, now your own people are showing you the mirror Kamal Nathji, and saying there has been no loan waiver! Will the government still not wake up?""Coinciding with Scindia’s attack was Digvijaya Singh’s tweet with a picture of stray cattle on the Bhopal-Indore highway. “The MP government should immediately remove them from roads and send them to cow sanctuaries and shelters.” He followed it up with a tweet addressed to the CM: “Kamal Nathji, if you take prompt action, then you will be regarded a true gau-bhakta and it will be a lesson for the so-called BJP leaders.”Nath replied with a flurry of tweets in the evening. The first said: “Dear Digvijayaji... Let me tell you that a few days ago, concerned for their safety, I instructed officials to prepare an action plan.”The CM added that during rains, cows sit on roads because the soil of agricultural fields is wet, and thus get killed in vehicular accidents. “Construction of 1,000 cow shelters is in progress,” he tweeted."

CHIKLI (MAHARASHTRA): Union home minister and BJP chief Amit Shah on Friday said the Congress and NCP work for their respective families, while the BJP and Shiv Sena have only the country's interest on their mind.Addressing a poll rally here in Buldhana district of Maharashtra, Shah lambasted the opposition for opposing scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir ""The people of Maharashtra have a choice to make. The Congress and NCP work for the welfare of their respective families, whereas the BJP and Shiv Sena have only the country's interest in their mind,"" Shah said.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's first decision after winning a historic mandate for a second term in May was to scrap Articles 370 and 35A, which were impediments in complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India.""No PM ever dared to touch this issue. But, Modiji did it. Today Kashmir is an integral part of the country.""Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said rivers of blood will flow in the Valley if the decision (scrapping Article 370) was taken and voted against the decision in Parliament. But, not a drop of blood has been shed,"" the BJP chief said.The home minister said for the BJP, the country's security is more important than vote-bank politics.""Why is the opposition asking what is the connection of Article 370 with Maharashtra politics? The entire country wanted Kashmir to be a part of India and Modiji fulfilled that wish,"" Shah said.The assembly polls in Maharashtra, which has a 288- member assembly, will take place on October 21. The ruling BJP -Sena is seeking a second term in office."

MUMBAI: Rs 11 for a cup of tea, Rs 5 for a topi, Rs 12 for a vada pav. That’s the most a candidate can spend for the upcoming assembly elections in the country.The election commission has capped the expenditure limit for each candidate at Rs 28 lakh while resisting demands to raise it.The EC has also released a list of items a candidate is expected to spend on and set a limit for each. The list is exhaustive and covers everything from food to campaign material and even funds to be spent on hiring bodyguards.Officials said the rates were released after considering an average of prices across the state. The rates were finalised after consultations with political parties.According to the list, vegetarian meals should cost Rs 80, meals with sweet or deluxe meal should not cost more than Rs 120 ,and a non-vegetarian thali’s rate has been set at Rs 110.A senior official from the election department said, “Such a rate card is necessary as it helps a candidate budget his or her expenditure within the limit set by the election commission.”Candidates also incur expenditure on decoration outside offices and at the campaigning stage. At rallies, top leaders and star campaigners are also invited to draw crowds. They are welcomed with bouquets or garlands, which have an upper rate limit too.The rate per flower pot is set at Rs 500 and bouquets Rs 500 for large ones and Rs 200 for a smaller variety. The rate for garlands has been similarly set. Even crackers such as rassi bomb must not cost more than Rs 30 per box.Workers are also provided with caps and face masks, the rate for which has been fixed at Rs 5 each.“Candidates have to present their expenditure details to the election commission through expenditure inspectors. It is the job of the officers to figure out if the candidate had under-recorded the expenditure,” the officer said.Candidates, though, say some of the rates are not in keeping with market realities. “We had, in fact, petitioned the Election Commission of India to increase the overall expenditure from the existing Rs 28 lakh to Rs 70 lakh. Elections are a costly affair and there is a lot of people outreach involved. It costs money,” said a sitting MLA who is contesting again."

MUMBAI: Star campaigner and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath 's 20-minute address at a rally in Kandivli on Thursday clearly bore out BJP plans to whip up patriotic frenzy by using Article 370 as the poll plank.PM Narendra Modi has brought Pakistan to its knees by scrapping Article 370, he said. ""Pakistan PM Imran Khan has become an object of pity and ridicule in the international arena. He doesn't know when a surgical strike will hit his country,"" he said at Thakur Complex.That Article 370 will be the poll plank was laid down by Amit Shah before the polls were announced. Modi's popularity will be factored in too to woo voters, sources in the party said.""Modiji has deepened India's territorial integrity and unity by doing away with the contentious article.

KARNAL: Not willing to be outdone when it comes to making poll promises, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday pledged to raise the old age pension to Rs 5,100 per month if the Congress came to power. The CLP leader was campaigning for the party candidate Anil Rana from the Gharaunda assembly constituency in Karnal district on Thursday.As reported by TOI earlier this month, in March just before the Lok Sabha polls, former Haryana chief minister and INLD patriarch O P Chautala had promised to increase the old age pension to Rs 3,000 per month from the existing Rs 2,000 per month. After this, Hooda, while addressing a political rally at Rohtak on August 18, promised to increase the amount to Rs 5,000 per month. Not to be left behind, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala announced to give Rs 5,100 per month, the figure that Hooda has matched in his latest announcement.On Thursday, launching an attack on the incumbent BJP, the two-time Congress CM alleged that the state government had made measly hikes in the old age pension in the last five years, which was “comparable to ‘mingan’ (goat dung)”.“During our 10-year rule in Haryana, all promises made in the manifesto were fulfilled. However, BJP made 154 promises in the last manifesto, out of which not a single one was fulfilled. It also didn’t give higher prices for crops to farmers. It made the situation worse by imposing GST on the tools used in farming,” Hooda added.Recounting the achievements of the Congress regime, he said as many as 3.82 lakh poor families had got free plots, but the BJP government did not give even a single inch of land to the poor in the last five years. “Now the time has come to teach them a lesson in this election,” he said.Speaking about factionalism in the Congress, Hooda said there were no fissures and all were working together and the party would form the government with full majority. He evaded the query on resignation of former Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar from the party."

LUDHIANA: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Thursday that the ministers and MLAs of the ruling Congress were giving shelter to drug peddlers due to which the menace was not ending in Punjab. Sukhbir was visiting villages of Dakha assembly constituency to campaign for party candidate Manpreet Singh Ayali. He also assured that Akali Dal's decision to contest the assembly elections in Haryana without the support of Bharatiya Janata Party will not affect the alliance between SAD and BJP in Punjab.He said chief minister Amarinder Singh had vowed to end drug trade in 100 days by taking an oath with Gutka Sahib in his hands but failed to do so. He alleged the CM had taken an oath to end the drug menace in the state while his ministers and MLAs were openly involved with the drug mafia.He said because of the patronage of the Congress leaders, the drug peddlers are not afraid of police and frequent incidents had been reported where policemen were beaten up by those involved in the sale of narcotics. He said things had come to such a pass that home delivery of drugs had started in Punjab.He said Amarinder had committed the biggest sacrilege by taking a false oath on the sacred 'charn' of Guru Gobind Singh. The SAD chief said the CM was following in the footsteps of the Congress, which had always oppressed the Sikhs.Regarding complaints about worsening law and order during the bypolls, Sukhbir said SAD was not an ordinary party, and in case there were some incidents during elections then their workers would not sit quietly. He said it was their responsibility to bring it to the knowledge of the Election Commission that the ruling party could try to spoil the peaceful atmosphere during elections, because, he alleged that Congress was trying to utilise the state machinery in its own interests."

GURGAON: The government decision that has united the opposition against BJP is the amendment of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, which lifts the legal cover protecting the Aravali and Shivalik hills.Although the government has maintained that the proposed amendments to the 118-year-old Act will not damage the environment, the opposition parties, activists and residents have been vocal about how the bill, which was passed earlier this year in the state assembly, will lead to air pollution and groundwater depletion.TOI reached out to the parties, asking each what they felt about the PLPA Amendment Bill, 2019, and how they propose to safeguard the Aravalis in the run up to the state polls.When the bill was sent to the governor in March this year, Congress leaders led by former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda met governor Satyadeo Narain Arya requesting him not to give assent.Haryana Congress general secretary Pradeep Kumar Zaildar who has launched the ‘Aravalis se Jivan’ campaign, called the PLPA bill a draconian amendment. “The amendment will lead to the entire Aravalis being sold off like it happened in the Kot village in Faridabad . It is a matter of serious concern. It shows that the state government has the intent to sell off the Aravalis that has been protecting the region’s air and water for several centuries,” he said. The party is also going to include the issue in its manifesto, say sources.Jananayak Janta Party (JJP), which has also organised protests in Faridabad over the issue, had alleged that the bill was passed to give benefits to only the real estate sector. Sources in the party informed that the issue will be included in the manifesto of JJP.Both Swaraj India and Aam Admi Party (AAP) have given the Aravalis protection a priority in their manifestos. Swaraj India’s national chief Yogendra Yadav told TOI, “We have proposed an expenditure of Rs 900 crore under ‘Mission Jal-Jangal’ to revive the forests and water table in the state. The protection of the Aravalis is the most important. Also, our party is not only talking about Aravali conservation, but has given tickets to many environmentalists who have been working for it.”AAP’s manifesto states that the PLPA is vital for saving the fragile Aravalis. “The green lung of the region is under grave threat and must be protected. Our take on the issue is very clear — to lift the amendment and increase the forest and green cover in the city,” said RS Rathee, AAP’s Gurgaon candidate.Although the stand of INLD on the issue is not clear for the forthcoming elections, the party had demanded the resignation of the chief minister when the bill was passed.Political analysts feel the Aravalis issue might not concern all the voters in Haryana. “I don’t think issues like environmental protection and scrapping of PLPA concern voters in the entire state. Overall, it is not going to have an impact on the ruling party,” said Rajan Pandey, a political analyst.Environmentalists, however, are of the opinion that the protection of the Aravalis will play a role in the upcoming elections. “Since the destruction in the Aravalis impacts the entire north India, its protection should be a big issue for voters in the entire state, particularly in south Haryana. The PLPA amendment bill was all the more shocking from a government that had protected the Mangar Bani, a sacred grove and restored its buffer to 500 meters,” said Col. SS Oberoi, a legal and environment analyst.BJP has ruled out the allegations. “The opposition is criticising the bill because it doesn’t have any real issue to raise. The bill is in interest of people living in colonies that were built legally and of farmers who can’t even plough their fields due to PLPA. The Act is quite old and needed some amendments. It should be noted that our government gave protection to Mangar Bani and increased its buffer zone,” said Jawahar Yadav, Haryana government’s spokesperson."

NAGPUR/LATUR: Union home minister Amit Shah and NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday sparred over BJP's use of Article 370 as an issue in the Maharashtra assembly elections Pawar, addressing a rally at Hingna near Nagpur, said his party welcomed the abrogation of Article 370, but the BJP was exploiting it to target Opposition.Responding to the attack, Amit Shah said his party will raise the issues concerning national security.""One cannot get votes by constantly raising Pulwama (terror attack), Article 370 issues. The article was abrogated in Parliament. Today, the leaders of the BJP are asking us our opinion about it,"" Pawar said at Hingna.Shah, earlier in the day, had sought to know whether Pawar and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were in favour of the abrogation of Article 370 or against it.""Parliament abrogated the Article. Only four-five people opposed it. What they (those who opposed) said was that the decision can be taken, but the people in Kashmir should be taken into confidence first,"" Pawar said.""But the rulers today are criticising the opponents by raising the Article 370 issue instead of talking about what they are doing to resolve basic issues of people,"" he added.Why doesn't the Narendra Modi government ""show courage"" to also scrap Article 371 of the Constitution, which bars people from other parts of India from buying land in the northeastern states, Pawar said.""You scrapped Article 370, why don't you show the courage to scrap 371? We will support you...They (BJP) are misleading people in the name of 370, Pulwama,"" Pawar alleged.He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of seeking political mileage out of air strikes on terror camps in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack in February.The former Union minister said the decision to take hard measure to combat terrorism was taken ""unanimously"" by all-party leaders (at a meeting called by Defence Minister) and not by a ""single individual"", he said.""But political mileage was sought out of the valour shown by security forces, which was not right,"" Pawar said.Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi did not seek to exploit, politically, the victory in the 1971 war, he said.""She gave credit to the security forces. But political mileage was sought ...(after Balakot) and the BJP benefited from it in the Lok Sabha polls,"" he added.Agrarian crisis deepened on the BJP's watch but the government did not pay heed, he said.Pawar also alleged that ""not an inch of work"" was carried out on Chhatrapati Shivaji Memorial in the Arabian sea after Modi inaugurated the work (in December 2016).Countering Pawar at a rally in Latur's Killari, Shah said the issue of national security and Article 370 was ""important"" for the BJP.""Sharad Pawar and leaders of Congress asked me is Article 370 the only issue ... Maharashtra runs on the ethos of Shivaji Maharaj's swarajya (self-rule). The issue of national security will be discussed in the polls,"" the BJP chief said.""You run away if you want, we will definitely appeal to people of Maharashtra on the issue of national security,"" he added.""You cannot face us on the issue of development, Pawar Saheb. You (Congress-NCP government) gobbled up money of the poor people of Maharashtra,"" he alleged."

PHALTAN: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said that senior Congress leader Sushilkumar Shinde made a pitch for Congress-NCP merger as he meant to convey that only through this move these parties can bag the post of leader of opposition (LoP) in the assembly.Fadnavis said the Congress and NCP will not get the numbers required to get the LoP post.A political party has to bag 10 per cent of the total number of seats to get the LoP post.""Sushilkumar Shinde said in Solapur that they are now tired and cannot work now. He pitched for the merger of NCP and Congress. Shinde is a leader with foresight ... he knows what the situation is,"" the chief minister said.He was addressing a public rally in Phaltan in Satara district, where BJP-Shiv Sena-RPI(A) candidate Digambar Aagwane is in the fray.Fadnavis added that Shinde can foresee the condition of both the parties post-election.""He knows that both the parties will not even get 10 per cent seats required to elect the Leader of Opposition and that is why he pitched for merger of both the parties so that together they can get 10 per cent seats and secure the post of LoP,"" he said.Fadnavis said that the ongoing assembly poll campaign is a one-sided affair as the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance has no real opponent.""Even a child will tell that the state assembly polls are pre-decided and it's a foregone conclusion that the BJP- Sena are set to retain power with a better margin,"" he said.Even Rahul Gandhi has conceded defeat and that is why he left for Bangkok in the midst of the election campaign, Fadnavis alleged.He said that in the 15 years of the Congress-NCP rule, the erstwhile government did not think about the common man who in turn taught them a lesson in 2014.""My government has done better than the 15-year rule of the Congress and NCP,"" he claimed.Fadnavis also said he will ensure that Maharashtra is made drought-free in the next five years.He also promised that urban and rural infrastructure in the state will be upgraded."
